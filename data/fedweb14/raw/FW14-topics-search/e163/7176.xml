Today, Wollman Rink has the largest Learn to Skate program in the nation. The city has responded to the thirst for ice with four new seasonal rinks this winter, but due to the volatile weather conditions (it was 65 degrees for three days in mid-December, for example) outdoor ice can be spotty. "There are a lot of seasonals here," Butler said. "But seasonals, mostly outdoor, everything...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e163-7176-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e163/7176_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 14:38:36">http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=627348#&amp;navid=nhl-search</link><title>Visitors to Cup fountain encouraged to try tap water</title><description>and the NYC Department of Environmental Protection at a ceremony to celebrate the beginning of the 2012 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

Kovalchuk presumably will test his foot at the morning skate on Thursday, and perhaps in warm-ups before the game. He...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e163-7176-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e163/7176_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 14:43:20">http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=418680#&amp;navid=nhl-search</link><title>Eastern Time Blog - Day 1</title><description>it into any of my copy off of tonight's game, a 4-3 victory in which the Rangers stole home-ice advantage away from the Capitals: MARKUS NASLUND On weathering the Capitals' surges: "Yeah, weather it and we have to do a better job of staying out of the box, myself especially. We can't let them have the seven power plays. That's going to be a big part of it.

(Note to my wife, Joy: The boots might not have gone with the business clothes, but they would have been a far better choice.) While the 12 degree Chicago weather was getting to me, Bobby Hull didn't seem to mind. We met him at the Taco Bell on the corner of Clark and Addison - don't worry, DiLo, I got a doggie bag.

The area is inhabited by many transplants from N.Y., N.J. and Philadelphia. At first, hockey traditions came in with the new residents. Now, hockey interest is waning.

The Calgary hockey market is huge, it has the resources (the football stadium for the CFLâ€™s Calgary Stampeders) and weather to support such an excursion, and it would appeal to both Canadian and American fans, seeing teams from...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
