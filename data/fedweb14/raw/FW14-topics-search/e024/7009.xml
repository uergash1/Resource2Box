LinkedIn Engineering session at SD West 2008 – A follow up Ruslan Belkin March 9, 2008

I would like to thank everyone who attended our “Birds of a Feather” interactive presentation at SDWest 2008.

This release is very exciting for us as it builds upon the foundation we’ve put in place, making features like Status possible. One of the key value propositions of LinkedIn is being informed about what your network is…

You may have seen some of my earlier videos on the blog (here and here) describing the engineering nuances and philosophy at LinkedIn. This time around, I’d like to announce that some of our lead engineers and I, will be sharing our experiences and best practices during a Birds of a Feather presentation at the Software Development Conference and Expo West. The event will be held on March 4th, 2008 from 7:00pm to 8:30pm at the Santa Clara Convention Center. Feel free to check out…
