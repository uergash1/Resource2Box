(my own developed thoughts)﻿ One of his speeches is music. If someone talks to you , you shall answer!! 
﻿Why do people rather fly to the moon than to help each other? People wouldn't even play piano music for you. They hate each other, I﻿ don't know why, there is no reason!! So start with this: In a cafe there is sitting all alone an old man, looking really sad, not knowing why he must exist. What whould you do? Point at his old clothes, laugh about him and go home? In a shop there is an old woman, who rather cannot carry all the bottles and cans home. What would you do? 
OPEN YOUR EYES!!!
