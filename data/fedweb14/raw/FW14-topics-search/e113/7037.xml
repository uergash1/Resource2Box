From the legendary first line  "We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold" to the poignant last line  "I felt like a monster reincarnation of Horatio Algera Man on the Move, and just sick enough to be totally confident.", Hunter S. Thompson spins the reader on an insane drug-addled journey through the streets and sites of downtown Las Vegas, where we experience a veritable menagerie of mayhem, terror and hilarity. 
The story follows the exploits of a freelance journalist travelling by the name of 'Raoul Duke' and his Samoan attorney 'Dr Gonzo' on their search to discover the truth behind 'The American Dream'. Fear and Loathing Review9 years ago in Articles &amp; Interviews

"His Dark Materials" 
Trent Reznor nails it with the controversial album that caused an uproar throughout America 
Flailing limbs, sweaty bodies rocking to the pounding music and the deafening roar of a thousand screams and the stench of hate combined with rage saturates the air. 
The 90's were a decade in which grunge music made it's debut into the mainstream. Previously underground, grunge music was left to the likes of Alice In Chains and Mudhoney; who were at the forefront of the scene at the time. Lyrics about real life drug addictions and abuse were as controversial as the image that was portrayed. But a man by the name of Kurt Cobain and his band Nirvana stepped onto the stage and changed the grunge music scene forever. There was now a man controlling the direction of this music genre, and many other bands jumped onto the bandwagon; trying to imitate Nirvana's image and sound to no avail.

Though I live life openly as a gay man, I don't really conform to many of the current stereotypes. 
On the surface, I've got a goatee -- granted -- but it's often wild and bushy only rarely clipped to perfection. And as you can see, the closest I've come to chiselled pecs and a six pack for many a year are man-boobs and a barrel-belly. 
And while I sometimes secretly aspire to owning a collection of Armani suits, lately I've been wondering if I'm the shortest man ever to buy from the big men's section at Tar-jay. 
I've never worshipped at the altar of Kylie Minogue. I suspect that if I was stranded on a desert island with a Walkman and just a Kylie CD to remind me of humanity, chances are pretty good I'd drown myself (Nothing personal Kylie).

for Liu Xiaobo 
Bold as palace tiles, yellow-glazed dawn 
descends the Heavenly Gate, 
setting itself upon the city of 
emperors. There I am 
arrested by your Tiananmen Square, Xiaobo; 
there I am wondering 
what it means to be forbidden  
as a palace, as 
you, as words that, as love, 
will be like always.Forbidden4 years ago in Free Verse
