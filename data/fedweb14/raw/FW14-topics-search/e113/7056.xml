The pressure on my chest, 
The needle probing my heart. 
She's prettier, 
She funnier 
What do I have that she doesn't? 
She has his attention, 
She has his time, 
She has his heart. 
And I'm left in the dust. 
Thrown aside, thrown away. 
And as he left 
He ripped my heart in two. 
Broken and tattered I lay by the road 
When you walked by 
You said I was prettiest 
You said I was funniest 
Your sewed me up. 
You dulled the needle 
Now a feather tickling my heart 
That pressure in my chest lifted 
Leaving me all bubbly 
And the threat of tears 
Spilled over in happiness. 
For I had your time 
I had your attention, 
I had your heart. 
And you had mine.Roads of Love4 years ago in Free Verse
