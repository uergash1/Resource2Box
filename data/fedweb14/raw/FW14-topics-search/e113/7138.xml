His wheels have stopped whirling around, 
his thump has been heard all over, 
his torment is burning from now on. 
His dullness has been cast aside, finally. 
I was listening, 
And you? 
I was feeling everything 
Pain 
Regrets 
Pride, what a stupid thing! 
But a new, winding path he has traced before himself 
And before me too, because I listened to him and I felt it. 
But in a second, all has gone down 
The press of a button and everything is over. 
His voice replaced by bellows and whinnies 
and a sly laugh at my ears... 
Stop, 
STOP, NOW!!! 
Enough with you, men of faith and ethics! 
Enough with your hypocrisy and your fucking humour! 
You feel pity for someone who has no more a house 
and yet you can't find compassion 
for someone who's lost his life. 
It is true, so: 
You're good only 
when the world allows you to be. 
For what concerns me, 
the only thing I've in common with you 
is only in our speciesRemote control1 year ago in Free Verse
