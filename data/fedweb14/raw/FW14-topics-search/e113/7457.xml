The percussion is the rain on my windows 
The melody is the whistle when the wind blows 
The chorus is the chirping of crickets in June 
Man, oh man, I love that tune 
I dance to the beat of the rain all night 
When I hear the wind whistle, I'll be alright 
As long as there's music, by nature or freestyle 
Any good song always makes me smile 
I don't need an iPod or an MP3 
Nature's song is fine with me 
I just need an honest beat 
And friends to dance with in the street 
Prosaic singers, heavy synths, 
Clich√©d lyrics on radio hits 
That kind of music doesn't stay true 
Every time I hear it, I feel so blue 
I'd pick a nightingale's tune over all 
The empty songs that the MCs call 
"Popular, the best, what's in, no doubt," 
If that's what's in, I'd rather be out 
I prefer a piano, or an acoustic guitar 
I'm tired of songs about getting drunk at the bar 
Music needs meaning, not immodest fame 
Lyrics need love, not unending shame 
Music is so many things, 
Music is my everything 
Music is my motivation, pushTo Me, Music Is...2 years ago in Free Verse

Your end my beginning 
And everything I hoped for has been strangely set aside 
Reason for living, 
My mind is forgiving 
And destiny is proving to be absent from my life 
I know it, 
I feel it, 
I know when you're sleeping, 
I know the things you're dreaming 
And I know you will never give up and die. 
Conscious fulfilling, 
The darkness revealing all, 
Thoughts and insecurities are shining like the sun... 
Eyes are deceiving, 
Your mind will stop breathing, 
And all that you are made of will now rightly become mine. 
You know it, 
You feel it, 
I know when you're sleeping, 
I know the things you're dreaming, 
I love it when you're weeping, 
Even death can't stop this feeling 
And I know you will never give up and die 
Father, why have you forsaken me, 
My life is gone. 
Father, know how long it's taken me, 
I live again! 
I know when you're sleeping, 
I know the things you're dreaming. 
I know when you're sleeping, 
I know the things you're dreaming. 
I love when you're weeping 
Even death cLullaby For A Dead Man -Lyrics3 years ago in Songs &amp; Lyrics
