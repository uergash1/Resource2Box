This review will be for Allen Ginsberg's Howl, a poem that was highly controversial back in it's time, in the Beat Generation. 
Structure: 
The poem itself has three parts and an accompanying footnote. I found it easy to follow in this format, though the first two parts are rather long and take a while to get through. 
Language: 
Ginsberg notably uses vulgar language in some lines, which emphasizes the mood more. His metaphors and references are a bit confusing at times, but since I was born much later I suppose that makes sense! As a high school student, I am a frequent Wikipedia visitor, and the article on this poem analyzes the references easily for anyone who doesn't understand them. 
Tone: 
The voice of the poem is decidedly aggressive, pointing out the myriad of problems in American society. Ginsberg himself was devoted to fighting those problems. 
Focus:
