[electronic resource] : Occasioned by the opposition made to Dr. Rundle's election to the see of Gloucester. In which the credit of the history of the Old Testament is particularly considered. To which are added, three tracts, viz. I. An answer to Mr. Stone's second remarks on the case of Abraham, with regard to his being commanded by God to offer up his son Isaac in sacrifice. In a second letter to the Rev. Mr. Stone, M.A. and fellow of the learned society of Wadham-College in Oxford. II. A discourse on sincerity. Wherein is shewn, that sincerity affords just ground for peace and satisfaction in a man's own mind, and renders his conduct justly approvable to every other intelligent being. Occasioned by what Dr. Waterland has lately written on the subject. In a letter to a gentleman. III. A supplement to the tract intitled, The equity and reasonableness of a future judgment and retribution exemplified. In which the doctrine of the eternal and endless duration of punishment to the wicked, is more particularly and fully considered. By Thomas Chubb.</title><description>Some observations offered to publick consideration. [electronic resource] : Occasioned by the opposition made to Dr. Rundle's election to the see of Gloucester.
