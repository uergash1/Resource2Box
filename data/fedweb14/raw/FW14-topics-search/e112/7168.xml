In the last days of 2013, Calxeda, the ambitious startup that hoped to design ARM processors for data-center servers, imploded. Now El Reg has sifted its ashes, and pulled out some advice for the silicon upstart's contemporaries. The demise of Calxeda caused many to ponder the viability of general-purpose ARM-powered computing …

VMware spin-off Pivotal has released a platform-as-a-service along with a suite of analysis applications, bringing greater competition to a quiet corner of the market. The Pivotal One platform was announced on Tuesday, and sees the year-old upstart push out a product based on VMware's open-source Cloud Foundry, along with …

The HP Moonshot hyperscale servers are not even fully launched, and Intel and Calxeda are already bickering about whose server node is going to be bigger and better when they both ship improved processors for the Moonshot chassis later this year. Other engines will be coming for the Moonshot machines, too, HP execs tell El Reg, …

As Joe Yaworski, fabric product marketing manager at Intel, put it to El Reg, the next frontier of system innovation will be in fabrics. As we see it, that frontier may also be the front line of the InfiniBand war between Mellanox and Intel – with one upcoming battle being the former's 56Gb/sec interconnects versus Intel's new …

The hardware engineers at Dell's Data Center Solutions custom server unit have bent some metal around Calxeda's EnergyCore ARM server processors and donated a box to the Apache Software Foundation so it can tweak and tune the Apache web server as well as the Hadoop data munching stack and the Cassandra NoSQL data store to run on …

An opportunity to define the future of server processing comes along once every decade or so, and Applied Micro Circuit, a company known for its networking chips and PowerPC-based embedded controllers, wants to move up into the big leagues to take on Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and the handful of remaining etchers of RISC …

"Printed electronics" is one of those terms one sees being bandied about without really knowing what it means or why it's important. The premise of using printing techniques to create electrical circuits isn't hard to comprehend, but not everyone agrees on what comprises a "printing technique" or why you might want to use one, …

Hewlett-Packard might have been wrestling with a lot of issues as CEOs and their strategies come and go, but the company's server gurus know a potentially explosive business opportunity when they see it. That is why HP has put together a new hyperscale business unit inside of its Enterprise Server, Storage, and Networking …

Servers are going virtual these days, so maybe it is time for server chipsets and interconnects to do the same. With Advanced Micro Devices not building any chipsets that go beyond four Opteron processor sockets in a single system image – and no one else interested in doing chipsets, either – there is an opportunity, it would …

Cisco has rolled out upgrades to its "California" Unified Computing System blade servers, but its announcement could have been much more interesting. The networking-cum-server-making giant is hosting its annual IT and communications Cisco Live event in Las Vegas this week, and in a perfect world this would also have been the …
