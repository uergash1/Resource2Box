Over 600,000 visitors came to the downtown St. Petersburg museum to see the Romanov artifacts. This virtual tour was constructed to promote that exhibition. We have left this site up under exclusive contract with the Moscow Kremlin Museums, owners of the exhibition.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
