What happens when the two partner up? ...   ... That's what Bayer Labs wants to check out and see with its Didget blood glucose meter and its partner online game. Didget is a blood glucose meter that syncs directly with Nintendo DS (the Gameboy's upgraded version) and into an online adventure game called "Knock 'em Downs World Fair."
