Definition Collagen vascular disease occurs when problems with the immune system affect collagen. Collagen is a tough, fiber-like protein that makes up 30% of body protein. It contributes to the structure of tendons, bones, and connective tissues. In a class of diseases known as autoimmune disorders , the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. Some of these diseases have similarities, including arthritis and inflammation of arteries in the tissues that connect joints and other tissues. These diseases are known as collagen vascular diseases. Collagen vascular diseases include: Ankylosing spondylitis Dermatomyositis Polyarteritis nodosa Psoriatic arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Scleroderma Systemic lupus erythematosus Causes, incidence, and risk factors ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7250-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7250_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 09:14:51">http://www.healthcentral.com/asthma/c/question/510575/48148</link><title>what is the collagen vascular disease that causes asthma?</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7250-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7250_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 09:15:19">http://www.healthcentral.com/ency/408/001226.html</link><title>Rheumatoid-collagen disease overview</title><description>...

Baby Boomers need to understand how to maintain a healthy vascular system as they become seniors.Â By 2015, the U.S. Census reports an expected 87 million people aged 55 and older, up from 67 million in 2005. Since vascular disease primarily affects seniors, the number of vascular disease cases is expected to rise dramatically. The vascular system is made up of arteries and veins that carry oxygen-rich blood throughout the body to the vital organs, the brains, and the legs. As we age, our arteries tend to thicken with a buildup of plaque and cholesterol, get stiffer, and narrow. When blood flow is restricted, vascular disease like carotid artery disease can lead to stroke; peripheral artery disease can lead to problems walking and in the most advanced cases, foot ulcers, gangrene, and possible amputation; and abdominal aortic aneuryism can result in death if not treated early. These five practices are not new, but with so many people reaching senior status, it is important to reme... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7250-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7250_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 09:16:23">http://www.healthcentral.com/high-blood-pressure/</link><title>Peripheral Vascular Disease</title><description>...

Peripheral Vascular Disease usually refers to atherosclerosis (development of fatty deposits that narrow arteries) in the peripheral arteries (often the legs). Mention blocked arteries and most people think of the heart. But blockages can affect other areas of the body as well - and certain types of leg or foot pain can be an important warning sign of potentially serious circulatory problems. When leg pain occurs with exercise and is relieved promptly by rest, chances are that blockage has invaded the vessels of the legs or feet. Doctors call this condition lower-extremity peripheral vascular disease. Leg pain severe enough to prevent a person from working, walking the golf course, or even crossing the street may be a symptom of advanced peripheral vascular disease, also known as atherosclerosis of the extremities. Late in life, fatty, fibrous plaques are likely to narrow the body's large and medium-sized arteries, impeding the flow of blood. As the plaques grow larger, the arteries ... ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
