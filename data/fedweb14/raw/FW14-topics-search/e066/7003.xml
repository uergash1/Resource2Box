Â  ... Several investigations have linked circumcised males to an decreased risk of HIV infection.

Definition Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin of the penis . Alternative Names Foreskin removal; Removal of foreskin Description The health care provider will usually numb the penis with local anesthesia before the procedure starts. The numbing medicine may be injected at the base of the penis, in the shaft, or applied as a cream. There are a variety of ways to perform a circumcision. Most commonly, the foreskin is pushed from the head of the penis and clamped with a metal or plastic ring-like device. If the ring is metal, the foreskin is cut off and the metal device is removed. The wound heals in 5-7 days. If the ring is plastic, a piece of suture is tied tightly around the foreskin. This pushes the tissue into a groove in the plastic over the head of the penis. Within 5-7 days, the plastic covering the penis falls free, leaving a completely healed circumcision. The baby may be given a sweetened pacifier during the procedure. Tylenol (acetaminophen) may be given afterward.

Circumcision is a surgical procedure, up until very recently performed without anesthetic, that removes the foreskin hooding the end of the penis , thereby exposing its tip, the glans. The operation of circumcision is usually done within days of birth, preferably before the age of two months, with or without local anesthetic or painkillers, at the surgeon's discretion. Some Jewish families have the circumcision performed by a specially trained rabbi called a mohel, as part of a ceremony held on the eighth day of life. After the operation, the scar is protected with gauze and petroleum jelly. Overall, circumcision is a safe, low-risk procedure, provided the operator is well trained and experienced. While certain religious groups, notably Moslems, Jews and some Africans, routinely circumcise new boys, many of the world's peoples have never practiced it. Circumcision was introduced into the English-speaking world in the 19th century for hygienic reasons and as a possible "cur... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7003-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7003_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 23:02:56">http://www.healthcentral.com/ency/408/001281trt.html</link><title>Paraphimosis treatment</title><description>...
