Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a progressive motor and sensory neuropathy (nerve disorder) characterized by weakness and atrophy, primarily in the leg muscles. It also known as hereditary sensory motor neuropathy, and peroneal muscular atrophy (PMA). Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is named for French neurologists Jean M. Charcot and Pierre Marie, and British neurologist Howard Tooth, who simultaneously described the disorder in 1866. CMT is generally divided into two types, which are similar in symptoms but different in respect to certain underlying nerve abnormalities. The hypertrophic form, or Type 1, is characterized by thickened nerve fibers and abnormalities in their insulating material ( myelin ) and by slowed conduction of nerve signals along the fibers. In the neuronal form, or Type 2, there is deterioration of the nerve fiber but little or no slowing of nerve impulses. Due to the slow progression of the disease, its onset is often difficult to determine. The hypertrophic form, wh... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7294-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7294_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 11:58:28">http://www.healthcentral.com/ency/408/000727.html</link><title>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (hereditary) overview</title><description>... Definition Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a group of inherited disorders that affect the peripheral nerves (those outside the brain and spine). Alternative Names Progressive neuropathic (peroneal) muscular atrophy; Hereditary peroneal nerve dysfunction; Neuropathy - peroneal (hereditary); Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy Causes, incidence, and risk factors Charcot-Marie-Tooth is one of the most common inherited nerve-related disorders. Defects in at least 14 genes cause different forms of this disease. The disease involves damage to the covering ( myelin sheath) around nerve fibers. In some, the disease causes destruction of the myelin sheath. In others, the central (axon) portion of the nerve cell wears away. Nerves that stimulate movement (the motor nerves) are most severely affected. The nerves in the legs are affected first and most severely. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7294-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7294_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 11:58:56">http://www.healthcentral.com/ency/408/000727trt.html</link><title>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (hereditary) treatment</title><description>...

Alternative Names Progressive neuropathic (peroneal) muscular atrophy; Hereditary peroneal nerve dysfunction; Neuropathy - peroneal (hereditary); Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy Symptoms Symptoms usually begin between mid-childhood and early adulthood. They may include: Foot deformity (very high arch to feet) Foot drop (inability to hold foot horizontal) Loss of lower leg muscle, which leads to skinny calves Numbness in the foot or leg "Slapping" gait (feet hit the floor hard when walking) Weakness of the hips, legs, or feet Later, similar symptoms may appear in the arms and hands, which may include a claw-like hand deformity. Signs and tests A physical exam may show: Difficulty lifting up the foot and making toe-out movements Lack of stretch reflexes in the legs Loss of muscle control and atrophy (shrinking of the muscles) in the foot or leg Thickened nerve bundles under the skin of the legs A muscle biopsy or nerve biopsy may confirm the diagnosis. Nerve conduction tests are often done to te... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7294-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7294_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 12:00:03">http://www.healthcentral.com/migraine/headache-specialists/arkansas-39386-5.html</link><title>Mary L.
