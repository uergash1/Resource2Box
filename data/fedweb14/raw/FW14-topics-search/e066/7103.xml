Treatment An early diagnosis of CF and a comprehensive treatment plan can improve both survival and quality of life. Follow-up and monitoring are very important. If possible, patients should be cared for at cystic fibrosis specialty clinics, which can be found in many communities. When children reach adulthood, they should transfer to a cystic fibrosis specialty center for adults. Treatment for lung problems includes: Antibiotics to prevent and treat lung and sinus infections. They may be taken by mouth, or given in the veins or by breathing treatments. People with cystic fibrosis may take antibiotics only when needed, or all the time. Doses are usually higher than normal.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic , progressive and genetic (inherited) disease of the body's exocrine (mucus producing) glands which affects approximately 30,000 children and adults in the United States. Cystic fibrosis (CF) primarily affects the respiratory , digestive and reproductive systems, as well as the sweat glands. The mucus secreted is very thick and blocks passageways in the lungs and digestive tracts. Cystic fibrosis is transmitted to a child when both parents carry the recessive gene but do not have the disease. When such a couple has children, there is a 25 percent chance that one of their children will develop cystic fibrosis; there is a 50 percent chance that the child will carry the gene, but will not have the disease; and a 25 percent chance that the child will be totally unaffected. Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal hereditary disorder for Caucasians in the U.S. About 1 in 2500 Caucasians are affected, and more than 10 million people (one in 31 Americans; on... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7103-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7103_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 22:43:33">http://www.healthcentral.com/ency/408/003409.html</link><title>Neonatal cystic fibrosis screening overview</title><description>... Definition Neonatal cystic fibrosis screening is a blood test that screens newborns for cystic fibrosis (CF). Cystic fibrosis is disease passed down through families that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive tract. It can lead to breathing and digestive problems. Alternative Names Cystic fibrosis screening - neonatal; Immunoreactive trypsinogen; IRT test How the test is performed A sample of blood is either taken from the bottom of the baby's foot of a vein in the arm. A tiny drop of blood is collected onto a piece of filter paper and allowed to dry. The dried blood sample is sent to a lab for analysis. The blood sample is examined for increased levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), a protein produced by the pancreas that is linked to CF. How the test will feel The brief feeling of discomfort will probably cause your baby to cry. Why the test is performed Children with CF who are diagnosed early in life and start treatment at a young age may have better nutri... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7103-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7103_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 22:44:17">http://www.healthcentral.com/acid-reflux/18135-146.html</link><title>Cystic fibrosis</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7103-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7103_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 22:44:42">http://www.healthcentral.com/ency/408/000107prv.html</link><title>Cystic fibrosis prevention</title><description>... Prevention There is no way to prevent cystic fibrosis. Screening those with a family history of the disease may detect the cystic fibrosis gene in 60 - 90% of carriers, depending on the test used.

Definition Cystic fibrosis is a disease passed down through families that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other areas of the body. It is one of the most common chronic lung diseases in children and young adults. It is a life-threatening disorder. See also: Cystic fibrosis - nutritional considerations Neonatal cystic fibrosis screening Causes, incidence, and risk factors Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a defective gene which causes the body to produce abnormally thick and sticky fluid, called mucus. This mucus builds up in the breathing passages of the lungs and in the pancreas, the organ that helps to break down and absorb food. This collection of sticky mucus results in life-threatening lung infections and serious digestion problems. The disease may also affect the sweat glands and a man's reproductive system. Millions of Americans carry the defective CF gene, but do not have any symptoms. That's because a person with CF must inherit two defective ... ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
