Hi... I'm Andie and I live with Fibromyalgia (among other things.).     To me it can feel like living on death row. You sit there in pain that can be so severe as to leaving you literaly weeping on the floor, yet you can't die from it. You might even want to, but it won't give you that release.     I'm sure most living with chronic pain can relate.     I'd love to hear from you!       ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7299-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7299_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 12:16:18">http://www.healthcentral.com/sexual-health/c/question/767556/130892</link><title>I wanted to know if genital warts grow in tiny rows as well as clusters?</title><description>...

I recently had an episode last me 6 days in a row, with new symptoms, EXTREME fatigue, sharp pain and pressure in LEFT temple/ear area, and weakness in my right arm. when ever i sat up or bent over i felt immense pressure in my head that was so intense that I was laying in bed whenever i could get away with it... and I am a 21 year old mother of a 1 1/2 year old, sp this hasnt been an easy recovery.  I am asking this in hopes to gain insight. I am uninsured and I dont want to walk into an expensive appointment not knowing if i am getting proper care, or if they are running the right tests ( if any at all) ... the only time that i say a dr about my migranes was at age 14, and I was suffering since age 9. he gave me immitrex and said that some people just get them. and whell that was ok for a long time, but that answer is no longer acceptable, and i want and deserve more. becasue this is suffering and I need to get peace... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7299-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7299_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 12:17:15">http://www.healthcentral.com/heart-disease/c/question/222877/142212</link><title>Experiencing occasional irregular heartbeats, most recently got two or three of them in a row.</title><description>...   ...  Tonight I was just watching TV and suddenly got two or three abnormal beats like this in a row and it gave me a terrible feeling like my heart was seizing up or something.

My family has a history of heart problems but I'm only 23 and haven't had any other health issues that I'm aware of. ...   ...  I do drink a lot of coffee and have anxiety at times, but I don't know if that has anything to do with it.

Full Question: ... How many days in a row can I safely take Imitrex. I take Imitrex 100 mg tabs.  I'm trying to break up rebound migraines after taking Fioricet with codeine.  Also, how many days to I need to be off painkillers (mainly Fioricet) to stop this rebound cycle?  Can I take plain Tylenol or Excedrin while I'm stopping the Fioricet and then try to wean off of those?   Imitrex and other triptan's side effects temporarily make symptoms worse for about 1-2 hours so I try to avoid it, but they always do cure the migraine. If necessary I will take imitrex.  I know the dangers of pain killers/NSAIDS, but I'm not sure about Imitrex. I worry about my liver and kidneys with all the Tylenol. I also take Zoloft 400 mg HS, Cymbalta  60 mg in morn, Neurontin 1200 mg, Lamictal 200 BID, Prazosin (for PTSD nightmares) 2mg HS and Seroquel.  A couple wks ago I received an injection of Lupron for endometriosis and started Progesterone tabs 5mg in a.m. I will... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7299-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7299_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 12:17:57">http://www.healthcentral.com/sexual-health/c/question/158788/89718</link><title>I am ask am I pregant bec my breast and nipple hurt it been like this 6 day rows</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7299-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7299_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 12:18:14">http://www.healthcentral.com/multiple-sclerosis/c/question/865055/68276</link><title>What can happen if I mistakenly took my Betaseron 2 days in a row?</title></snippet></snippets></search_results>
