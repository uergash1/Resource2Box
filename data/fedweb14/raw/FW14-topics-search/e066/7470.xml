My daughter has always been an adventurous eater. Even as a toddler, she happily tried all types of cuisine, particularly enjoying challenging flavors and textures like calamari and three-bean salad.  As an advocate for healthy choices, I patted myself on the back. “Well-done, self! You’re good at producing children with an instinct for clean living,” I told myself. ...   ... And then came my pickier eater. My son preferred all foods fried, chocolate, and generally junky. And as the years have unfolded, he and I continue to have very different opinions on what he should be eating. ...   ... When I relent or let down my defenses for a few days, he inevitably steers toward more sugar and processed foods.

I feel like I've had high blood sugar for days, maybe even a week and it's starting to get depressing. I'm not sure if my period is on the way, or if I'm getting sick, or if I am stressed out over my son who is having major anxiety issues. High blood sugar is the one part of having diabetes that really gets me down. It makes me feel like a failure, it makes me tired of course, and grouchy and it makes me feel like food is poison, or that my body is allergic to food. I've read the literature that says stress affects blood sugar levels so that could be my answer but I'm just doing guesswork. Is it directly related to this difficult phase that my son is going through? How do I know?   I want to know why I'm running in the 200's (out of the blue, nothing else has changed in my tightly scheduled life) and when it's going to stop. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7470-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7470_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 21:11:33">http://www.healthcentral.com/diet-exercise/c/161905</link><title>7 Awesome Youtube Videos On The Dangers of Sugar</title><description>... ...
