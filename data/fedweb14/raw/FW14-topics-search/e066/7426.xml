( click to enlarge) ...   ... For years now video games have been blamed for everything from learning disabilities to diminished social skills to heightened violent tendencies.  Researchers have been able to substantiate many claims about video games (especially regarding children), but there are still plenty of misconceptions out there about them. Let’s try to understand what’s going on by taking a look at some common video game myths.  ...   ... Myth: Video games are primarily influencing adolescent boys. ... Fact: Yes, video games are popular among children, but it may surprise you that only 25 percent of gamers are under 18 years old.  And perhaps even more surprising – 26 percent are over the age of 50.  The assumption that adults don’t play video games is probably as prevalent as the stereotype that most gamers are men.  While the latter is true overall, when you consider gamers under the age of 18, females outnumber males 33 to 20 percent.... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7426-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7426_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 18:58:53">http://www.healthcentral.com/adhd/c/1443/162238/video-addiction-children-autism</link><title>Video Game Addiction Possible for Children with ADHD and Autism</title><description>... ... Problematic Game Playing ... ... Video games offer relaxation and with the development of multi-player games, can offer socialization that children with ADHD and autism often miss out on - even if it is online and not in person. But playing video games can also become problematic. Problematic game playing is characterized by: ... ... ... Recurrent thoughts about playing, or the consistent urge to play, even when you are doing something else ... Restlessness or irritability when not able to play ...

The midwest had a wicked winter for weather, and being on chemo as well did not leave much energy for big outings with my six-year old son.  So, this past weekend, we took him and one of his friends to an arena football game.  First of all, arena football is great.  Bodies slamming into the wall, footballs flying into the stands, pyrotechnics and dancers everywhere.  Give a couple of little boys great seats, a free t-shirt and rally towel and you've created instant success.  To quote my son "Whoa Nelly."   Mid-game one of the players tosses a football at the boys.  I thought I was going to have to strap them into the seats to keep them down.  Jumping and yelling and big eyed excitement that even superceded the icy-cone.  Major score.   I leaned across my husband to talk to my son and felt the feminine pinch --- those of you who still have no hair will someday too feel the pinch.  That new hair in... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7426-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7426_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 18:59:35">http://www.healthcentral.com/obesity/c/276918/158921/healthy-snacking</link><title>Healthy Game Day Snacking on a Diet</title><description>... Game day is here! Whether you’re watching the big game from your living room couch or are one of the lucky few who are tailgating at Super Bowl 2013, you will be rooting for your favorite team and chowing down snacks. Most traditional Super Bowl spreads are unhealthy pub grub: A buffet of easy-to-prepare appetizers and entrees that go well with beer. These foods are not healthy for the average person, and pose a greater threat for those of us on a diet. ...   ... I have eliminated refined foods, fast food, red meat, sugar, saturated fats, starches, and grains from my diet. I’ve worked hard to lose weight and educate myself on how to eat healthy. So, I am not about to let game day cramp my style. Neither will I allow my style (diet) to hamper my enjoyment today. Believe it or not, it is completely possible, dare I say easy, to make delicious and nutritious Super Bowl Party fare. ...   ...

Last night, I was blessed to go see the movie my family has waited for approximately a decade, and thankfully, it was made in such a way that I was able to watch Ender's Game with my eyes open ! ...   ... I read the book the movie has been based on because my kids asked me to read it. I had no interest in a sci-fi story, but I did want to support my kids and have something in common to talk about. I was hooked. When my son played the audiobook version on a trip to the doctor (a four hour drive each way) my Hubs even became hooked on the story. When we heard there would be a movie, we got excited enough that even my Hubs who refuses to go to a movie, was ready to drop all and drive an hour to the nearest theater. ...   ...

What happens when the two partner up? ...   ... That's what Bayer Labs wants to check out and see with its Didget blood glucose meter and its partner online game. Didget is a blood glucose meter that syncs directly with Nintendo DS (the Gameboy's upgraded version) and into an online adventure game called "Knock 'em Downs World Fair." The tester earns points for testing the prescribed number of times per day and also by staying within targeted BG levels (which are programmable). Didget and the game target kids with diabetes who are between the ages of 4 and 14. An online demo is available, but neither myself nor my son could get it to work. ...   ...

My son has seen his family physician and diagnosed with epidimytis after complaining of pain in the testicles. The pain started after playing basketball approximately 11 months ago. There was likely an injury to the groin area during this game in question.  He has seen a urologist as well as family physcian. Other symptoms include impotence and lethargy. He is very bothered by his low levels of energy. His testosterone level tested low. He has been treated for  epidimitis several times with improvement in pain. It is basketball season and the heavy practice and game schedule has increased the discomfort as well. His family physician suggested we see either another urologist or an endochronologist. (Additional information: Kyle had MRSA- 2 years ago and was treated with high dose anti-biotics; also he is currently taking flonase on a daily basis). What type of specialist  should we see?) ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7426-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7426_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 19:01:09">http://www.healthcentral.com/osteoarthritis/eorthopod/faq/argument-difference-sports-2627</link><title>My brother and I are having an ongoing argument about the difference between boys and girls in sports.</title><description>... My brother and I are having an ongoing argument about the difference between boys and girls in sports. I maintain that girls who injure their ACL (like I did) get back to sports just as quickly as boys with the same injury. Of course, he is sure that if he had the same injury, he would have already gotten back into the game while I'm still in rehab. It's a fact that knee injuries (and especially anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears) are common among athletes. Basketball, volleyball, and soccer players seem to be at increased risk. This is probably because the actions that predispose them to injury (pivoting, cutting, twisting) are used so often in these sports activities. As to how quickly (and successfully) male versus female athletes return to sports after ACL surgery, there are studies that show females need more rehab than men. But there are just as many studies that report no difference between men and women in terms of test results or time to return to sport. Other factors that m... ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
