I am on a regiment of anti-depressants and pain meds. The antidepressants definately help me from becoming too despondent and hopeless.  In fact, just before giving up my career a little over a year ago, I was near suicidal. I am now much more stable and am able to "see the light at the end of the tunnel" on my good days. ...   ...

I have been on long term disability for a year now, after giving up a job I absolutely loved. ...   ... Every three months I go in for cervical injections,... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7500-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7500_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 22:38:26">http://www.healthcentral.com/migraine/c/question/636844/121461</link><title>tightness around the roof of my mouth and back of throat.

We're not sure what that means exactly. Can you enlighten us? Hip fractures in older adults can be complex and challenging to treat and manage well. Fractures from a high-energy injury such as your father's fall from a height can be accompanied by other injuries as well. Sometimes it takes some time for other problems to surface. Any hip fracture can be the catalyst that causes loss of independence. Serious complications such as pneumonia, infection, and blood clots can compromise return to health. Your father will be under close surveillance while in the hospital until his condition is stable. Most older adults have some form of osteoporosis.
