In researching this vegetable, I found a really cool website called NutritionData put together by Self .

The estimated glycemic load is 1, which works well since the typical glycemic target total daily is 100 or less. In addition, asparagus is moderately anti-inflamma... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7258-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7258_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 09:44:18">http://www.healthcentral.com/osteoporosis/c/76444/148458/classic-side</link><title>Classic Holiday Side Dishes Loaded with Calcium</title><description>...

Slowly, he began disappearing for days at a time...saying I had burned him.  He wouldn't answer calls.  He would ship a small but completely non-feeling communication about where he was but not answer calls.  Last year at this time, he moved out when we were away.  We returned and he totally jumped ship.  Then he came back saying: Let's get counseling.  He never did.  It got uglier and uglier as did I! I checked his email, his voicemail.  His vicious outbursts were getting uglier and uglier to me and also to my beloved children to whom he never even once apologized about his disappearances.  When he would 'go' they would call begging him to respond so that they knew he was ALIVE.  He would stay away days.  And then return to his beautiful family and we ... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7258-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7258_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 09:46:40">http://www.healthcentral.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/c/question/52974/34671</link><title>i have pain in my hands and my fingers feel like they lock up while doing dishes</title></snippet></snippets></search_results>
