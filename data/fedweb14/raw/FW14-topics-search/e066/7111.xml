Soldiers in basic training who have not been running are at increased risk for bone stress fractures. In this study military recruits in the Finnish army were studied. The goal was to find out how often and what type of stress fractures occur. Over 1,000 recruits with knee pain during exercise were included. Some had pain in one knee. Others had pain in both knees. Using MRIs the doctors found 141 bone stress injuries in 110 knees of male and female recruits. Seven percent had one bone stress injury. Another 8.6 percent had other injuries such as meniscal tears or ligament injuries. The rest (84 percent) had normal knees. Most injuries occurred in the medial (inner side) of the knee. Symptoms of pain with exercise or activity started about three months after military training began. The lower leg bone (tibia) or the thigh bone (femur) was affected most often. This is where most of the weightbearing stress occurs. An increase in how often or how long trainees exercise is the key to stres... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7111-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7111_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 23:20:38">http://www.healthcentral.com/osteoarthritis/eorthopod/news/injuries-among-female-marine-corps-recruits</link><title>Injuries Among Female Marine Corps Recruits</title><description>... Injuries in the military reduce productivity and troop readiness. Finding ways to prevent such injuries is an important goal. The results of this study from Marine Corps basic training at Parris Island (South Carolina) show that the incidence of lower extremity (LE) injuries in female recruits is high. Risk factors were identified. Out of 824 female recruits, there were 868 overuse injuries to the LE. And injured female Marine Corps recruits were more likely to reinjure themselves after returning to training. A key risk factor for all injuries was low aerobic fitness. This assessment was based on a slower time for these women on the timed run. Amenorrhea (not having a menstrual cycle) was another significant risk factor. Women who had not had a menstrual cycle in over six months were more likely to get injured during basic training. None of the women included in the study had been pregnant during the previous year. Stress fractures were more likely to occur in women who had less than s... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7111-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7111_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 23:21:05">http://www.healthcentral.com/</link><title>how do i apply for a salary for being a caregiver for my elderly father</title><description>... i've been trying to get a salary for being a caregiver for my 72 years old father, but it is so hard trying to get a direct answer and being advised as to where to go to apply and get the ball rolling. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7111-04"><link>http://www.healthcentral.com/skin-care/c/596118/168316/recruitment-outsourcing</link><title>Tips on finding the right firm for patient recruitment outsourcing services</title><description>...

My plan was to have a cigarette only in times of great stress. I put the pack of reds in the miscellaneous drawer in the kitchen next to the new Bic lighter with the American flag design on it.

That's when Plan B was put into effect. ... Plan B was that I would have a cigarette at 11AM and then another at 11PM. I would be in control.
