Last week American Idol had their annual Idol Gives Back program.  If you haven’t seen it, they bring dozens of top celebrities together for a two-and-a-half hour live show to raise money for charities in the U.S. and Africa.  Later that night Jimmy Kimmel, on his late-night TV show, was talking about Idol Gives Back .  He said, “This year they estimate they raised $100 million, which will be divided between a variety of good causes: fighting malaria, Save the Children, and the search for a cure for whatever’s wrong with Paula.”  Of course he was referring to Paula Abdul. His “joke” got a big laugh from the audience, but not from me.  I’m tired of comedians and, even worse, serious journalists intimating that Ms. Abdul is whacked out on drugs because of one or two incidents (taken out of context) where she appeared to be acting a little strangely.  The fact is Paula Abdul has Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (also known... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7459-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7459_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 20:37:37">http://www.healthcentral.com/osteoporosis/c/310478/152132/relcast</link><title>relcast what a joke and the jokes on me</title><description>... i reluctently and recently, probably 2 1/2 mths now, had the reclast infusion, my oncololgist suggested it last year , i was against it, once its in you, no turning back.  so then my rheumotologist suggested it and i gave in. now 2mths later, i developed HBP. i never had HBP my whole life, its always been normal low. my heartrate is eratic amoung other new symptoms, like muscular weaknes, short of breath. i mention these because i like to hike and never would be sooo out of breath as i was just recently. these symptoms, signs are all new. i am very disgusted and worried, hoping that in a years time and then some, will the reclast leave the body. too me, its like having a chemo treatment, not as toxic, but toxic enough to raise ones blood pressure to be in hytensive state.

"I hurt myself today to see if I can feel" Thats how I feel when I'm on meds.  I've decided to quite my meds because I want to feel again.  I've been working on my suicide plan for late September or October.  The thought is there even when I'm on meds.  I've attempted many times.  I plan on success this time. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7459-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7459_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 20:38:29">http://www.healthcentral.com/diabetes/c/110/14003/time-joke</link><title>Time for a joke!</title><description>... Things have been a bit serious around here. It's time to lighten up and retell an old joke... I've sure gotten old. I've had two by-pass surgeries. A hip replacement and new knees. Fought prostate cancer, and diabetes. I'm half blind and can't hear anything quieter than a jet engine. I take 40 different medications that make me dizzy, winded or subject to blackouts. I have bouts with dementia. I have poor circulation and can hardly feel my hands and feet. I can't remember if I'm 85 or 92, and I have lost all my friends. Thank God, I still have my Florida driver's license! Got any good ones that mention diabetes? Share them with everyone by adding the joke as a comment here. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7459-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7459_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 20:38:46">http://www.healthcentral.com/chronic-pain/c/94560/61900/hahaha-cosmic</link><title>hahaha, this is all a cosmic joke, right????</title><description>... its so strange... ... i have to wait until St. Patty's day to have my MS consult. this is all just sooo much to be comprehending right now, at this time and age... my brother is cramming for his mid terms, talking about colleges. ... oh well. this is my life... there are no 'what ifs' or pitty potty crap, for more than just one obvious reason, for one, Jesus is my Everything, esp. my strength. another reason is the fact of my age.
