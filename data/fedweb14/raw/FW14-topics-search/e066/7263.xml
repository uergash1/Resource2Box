Definition Hospital-acquired pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that occurs during a hospital stay. Alternative Names Nosocomial pneumonia; Ventilator-associated pneumonia; Health-care associated pneumonia Causes, incidence, and risk factors Pneumonia is a very common illness. It is caused by many different germs, and the infection can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. Hospital-acquired pneumonia tends to be more serious than other lung infections, because: Patients in the hospital are often sicker and unable to fight off germs. The types of germs present in a hospital are often more dangerous than those encountered in the community. Hospital-acquired pneumonia occurs more often in patients who are using a respirator machine (also called a ventilator) to help them breathe.

Supportive treatment includes: Oxygen Lung treatments to loosen and remove thick mucus from the lungs Support Groups Expectations (prognosis) Most patients respond to treatment and improve within 2 weeks.

Â  ... Little did I know I would have real time, up close and personal facts to report to you on the subject. You may or may not know, depending on the length of time you have been treated for RA, that the main villain in RA is your immune system. It is mistaking your synovial linings around your joints as an enemy of your body. As it is programmed to do, your immune system attacks this lining and as it slowly erodes the lining you also begin to lose cartilage, and finally bone. (this is a VERY simplified explanation) There are many different parts of the immune system that may be at fault with RA, T cells, B cells, TNF, IL-6 and IL-1 are only a few.... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7263-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7263_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 10:04:48">http://www.healthcentral.com/copd/c/question/882378/96515</link><title>Is community acquired pneumonia contagious?</title><description>...
