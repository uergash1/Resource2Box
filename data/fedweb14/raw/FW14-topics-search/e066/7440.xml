Now as quiet as it's kept (a few close friends know) I really only like the Real Housewives of New York. Here's why -- they're really fit and really funny.  Bethenny is my superhero.  Not only is she the spokesperson for Pepperidge Farm but she is the author of the Skinny Girl craze.  You know, if not perhaps you've been hiding in a tent on a campground somewhere in West Virginia. No, no I'm not saying anything negative about West Virginia, I hear they've got super campgrounds and hiking there... try Spruce Knob in Seneca Rocks or Holly River in Morgantown. ...   ... Back to Bethenny, well, throughout every season of the Real Housewives of New York (RHNY) we see the Natural Foods chef surfing, eating healthy, walking, sharing healthy recipes even drinking low calorie liquor!

A very nice patient of mine died this summer. This former teamster spent most of his life enjoying his "golden brew" though he had had to cut back in recent years after recurrent episodes of alcohol related pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). These episodes had damaged his pancreas (the organ that makes insulin) enough to give him diabetes by the time that he was 45 years old, though that never stopped him from enjoying his meals despite what it did to his sugars (which he declined to follow). He did stop the alcohol without any medical support or counseling.   His wife was concerned that he would eventually die of lung cancer from his heavy smoking, as had his father and grandfather before him. She asked that I do my best to catch it early so that he could have the chance to survive that they never had. After all, he was the breadwinner for her and their large family.   We were quite lucky that the past three decades have been accompanied by advances in scien... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7440-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7440_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 19:40:40">http://www.healthcentral.com/skin-care/c/38641/47907/skin-improvement</link><title>Real Skin Improvement</title><description>...   ... It's easy to feel overwhelmed by all the different products that keep getting touted as the new and advanced versions of hope in a jar at the cosmetics counter. Pretty packaging and effective advertising may convince you that these new ingredients and science-heavy labels are the real thing. Words such as "cosmeceutical" and "bio-energetics" can create the implication that these cosmetics can work as drugs, altering and improving the structure of our skin. ...   ... Unfortunately, advertising simply masks the fact that our options for better skin are limited to just a few tried-and-true ingredients and procedures. ...   ... As a rule, the FDA's Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a cosmetic as a product intended for use in "cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance" ... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7440-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7440_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 19:40:56">http://www.healthcentral.com/migraine/c/82083/161486/video-startling-statistics</link><title>New "Faces of Migraine" Video Makes Startling Statistics Real</title><description>...
