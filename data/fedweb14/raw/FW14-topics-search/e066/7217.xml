You can make a case for bipolar for all three, though with Lincoln this would be a stretch. For all three we are talking about a complex overlay of mood and temperament that resolves into Lincoln being the melancholic one in the bunch and TR and LBJ the exuberants. Let’s get started ... ...   ... Abraham Lincoln ...   ... "I am now the most miserable man living," the 31-year-old Lincoln confessed. "Whether I shall ever be better I can not tell; I awfully forebode I shall not; To remain as I am is impossible; I must die or be better." ...   ... Depression was a constant in Lincoln’s life. He never overcame it, he never rose above it. But Joshua Shenk’s must-read 2005 “Lincoln’s Melancholy” makes the compelling point that crushing depre... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7217-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7217_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 07:02:11">http://www.healthcentral.com/bipolar/c/15/1452/happy-lincoln</link><title>Happy Birthday Lincoln . . . and Thoughts on His Struggle</title><description>... ... ... “No element of Mr Lincoln’s character,” declared his colleague Henry Whitney, “was so marked, obvious and ingrained as his mysterious and profound melancholy.’ His law partner, William Herndon, said, “His melancholy dripped from him as he walked.” ... ... Yet, contends Joshua Shenk in his outstanding new book, Lincoln’s Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and Fueled His Greatness , the same force that disrupted his life and nearly ended it also imbued him with a transcendent quality that changed the world. ... ...

If anyone wants to know what I’ve been doing since the middle of December, I’ve been giving my website a complete overhaul. To give you a rough approximation of the enormity of the task, mopping up the Exxon-Valdez oil spill was a snap next to what I’ve been going through. The Augean Stables? Hah! Hercules never had to teach himself Dreamweaver. Anyway, I just looked up from my computer and - holy cow! - it’s February, already. Not only that, it’s Lincoln’s birthday, his real one. This is too good not to write about. You see, attending to my website after basically three years of neglect is kind of like doing a spring cleaning - lots of sorting through mementos, lots of memories, lots of presiding idly around over eclectic piles of this and that, cogitating, contemplating, and just plain tating and plating. My early-post diagnosis articles, for instance. Relics of another era, authored by a pre-me version of me. Some genuine keepers, others in dire ne... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7217-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7217_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 07:03:17">http://www.healthcentral.com/bipolar/c/15/30028/making-movies-lincoln</link><title>Making Movies: FDR and Lincoln</title><description>... On my trip to Washington DC last month, I packed my new camcorder. Until my daughter's wedding in March, I never owned a camera. At the psychiatric conference I attended, I got some talking head shots, then I paid a visit to the FDR and Lincoln Memorials. I paid $800 for my camcorder. Little did I know I should have shelled out $3,500 minimum, plus another $3,500 for a decent lens, probably $10,000 for three more, plus $20,000 worth of accessories I since discovered I cannot afford to be without. Obviously, it was an oversight. But I was naive and enthusiastic. I was going to make movies. I was going to do it with a device designed for filming your kid blowing out birthday candles. FDR was the greatest President of the twentieth century. I felt I was on holy ground. The friend I was with felt so, too. I got out my camcorder and began filming. It was as if I had been planning the project for months. I was going to make a movie. "FDR, Man with a Disability." In 1921, in his prime, Franklin R... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7217-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7217_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 07:03:42">http://www.healthcentral.com/bipolar/community-26492-5.html</link><title>Meet Sue Bergeson, DBSA President</title><description>...

I’m not sure how many people know that Lincoln suffered from lifelong depression (it was essentially dismissed by an influential biographer in the 1940s), but those of us with depression could see it written clearly on his face. As you can imagine, in the 1800s, Lincoln’s options for treating his melancholy were very limited, and nearly as painful as the illness itself. Operating under the theory that melancholy was caused by an excess of black bile present in the body, the treatment regimen involved, among other tortures, bleeding, blistering, inducing vomiting and diarrhea, fasting, and mustard rubs and sweating followed by a cold bath. I’m ... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7217-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7217_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 07:04:29">http://www.healthcentral.com/depression/c/84292/150467/7-depression</link><title>7 Presidents who Battled Depression</title><description>...   ... In 2006 an article was published by psychiatrists at the Duke University Medical Center which reviewed the biographies of American presidents from 1776 to 1974. This study, which was published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease analyzed the historical data of 37 presidents looking for symptoms of mental illness as defined by the criteria of the DSM-IV, the Diagnostic Statistical Manual. What they found was startling. According to the Duke researchers, 49% of former presidents had experienced... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7217-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7217_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 07:04:55">http://www.healthcentral.com/bipolar/c/15/167429/bipolar-president-question-week</link><title>A Bipolar President Today?

Roosevelt used his office to save the environment and take on the corporate fat cats. Johnson turned out to be a surprise champion for civil and human rights.  ...   ... All of them were larger than life. All displayed unparalleled vision, were deep thinkers, rallied their nation, accomplished great things. Two of them, however - Adams and Johnson - were prone to bad judgment that tainted their legacies. Roosevelt, too, seemed to be spinning out of control, but wisely got out while the going was good. ...   ...

John Adams ...   ... David McCullogh in “John Adams” does not broach the topic of bipolar or mental illness, but in the book a clear picture emerges of a brilliant and temperamental revolutionary who knew how to seize the day, mobilize his countrymen, and change history. Nowhere was this more evident than the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, when Adams effectively floor-managed the break with Britain. ...   ...

August 1, 1972: Eagleton withdraws from the ticket.    ...   ... According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , Eagleton had been hospitalized for mental health issues, including depression, three times between 1960 and 1966, and had undergone electro-convulsive therapy – also known as electroshock therapy – for " exhaustion and fatigue ." Eagleton was also taking Thorazine, a powerful anti-psychotic drug, information that had not been  disclosed to McGovern prior to his selection of Eagleton. ...   ... In a Time magazine poll conducted that summer,  76.7% of respondents said that Eagleton's mental health record would not influence their votes .  But there clearly was concern that given the pressures that come with being vice president and, potentially, the president, Eagleton was at risk for a recurrence of mental he... ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
