In a little while I will be headed out the door to hear Mahler’s Symphony #5 performed by the San Diego Symphony. Mahler’s music comes across as strange and impenetrable to the uninitiated. The strangeness never goes away - the initiated tend to fall in love with it.  ...   ... Mahler described himself as three times homeless, a Bohemian in Austria, an Austrian among Germans, and a Jew throughout the world. He lived during a time when Europeans felt smug about their achievements, just before the first World War was about to impose a severe reality check. I describe Mahler as the man who saw it coming.

I was driving home from a long trip the other day. I had my little dog Cassie next to me and music playing, and as I drove, I considered how important music can be for me as I work my wellness.   One of the songs I use to strengthen my resolve when things are hard is Wynonna Judd’s “ Only Love ,” especially the verse where she sings “Peaceful waters, raging sea / It’s all the same to me / I can close my eyes and still be free / When the waves come crashing down and thunder rolls around / I can feel my feet on solid ground.” It reminds me that life—for anyone—is never easy, and that it’s how I process it internally that makes all the difference. When I want to feel empowered,  I listen to Bon Jovi singing, “This ain't a song for the broken-hearted / No silent prayer for the faith-departed / I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd / You're gonna hear my voice / When I shout it out loud / It’s my life / It’s now or never….” When I am sad, I turn to Loreena McKennitt ’... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7079-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7079_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 20:35:55">http://www.healthcentral.com/obesity/c/922587/139512/explaining-obese</link><title>themes explaining why people are obese</title><description>...   ... http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2011/06/themes-explaining-people-obese.html ...   ... I know from my own experience, I was thin until I began to take mood stabilizers in my early 40's.  Would I have gained weight at that age (also when I began menopause) anyway?  I would like to know, but of course it is impossible to know for sure. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7079-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7079_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 20:36:32">http://www.healthcentral.com/breast-cancer/c/9009/11812/theme-give</link><title>Common theme: Never give up</title><description>...

Tomorrow, Nov. 14, is World Diabetes Day. In December 2006, the United Nations passed a resolution recognizing diabetes as a chronic, debilitating, and costly disease. The resolution designates World Diabetes Day to be observed each year as an official United Nations Day. the goal of the resolution was to increase awareness about diabetes around the world.   The theme for this year is Diabetes in Children and Adolescents . Diabetes can strike children at all ages. Unfortunately, most are diagnosed late and only when they have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Due to insulin not being available in many parts of the world, children are dying from diabetes complications.   For 2007 and 2008, the campaign message is that "no child should die of diabetes".   As the worldwide diabetes epidemic rages, children have been affected greatly by diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is growing at a rate of 3 percent per year among children and adolescents, and 5 percent among pre-schoo... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7079-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7079_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 20:37:38">http://www.healthcentral.com/bipolar/c/676728/102943/bipolar-theme</link><title>A Poem with a Bipolar Theme</title><description>... without you ...   ... can you see yourself folding? in half ... at first because ceilings close in ... when i am no Samson any longer ... and my donkey jawbone is ... misplaced. anyone could defeat us ... now. for now. but these are cycles; ...   ... it is mental, meaning ... synapses and neurotransmitters. ... it is you who holds up my ceilings, for now, ... and when we are apart i don’t go numb. ... i feel the nothing acutely, hear a kidnapper ... sharpening a knife ... to cut out letters for a ransom note ... and testing something that grinds ... and grinds. ...   ... that is how it feels to be me. nothing bad ever happens ... but it feels like it will. i am nervous for my own ... footfalls in the dark. sometimes I cry about it. ... listen because I am saying this ... is what it is like to be me now. ... for now. without you. ...   ...

When a loved one with Alzheimer’s Disease is living in a nursing home, how can caregivers ensure that their needs are being met? For instance when I visit Mom in the afternoon, I often ask Mom what she did that day, and she will reply “nothing.” Because of her short term memory loss, she rarely remembers what she had for lunch or whether she participated in bingo. ... ... That’s why I value the care team meetings that the nursing home holds on a quarterly basis. Similar to a parent/teacher conference that are held in schools, these meetings provide an opportunity for family members to hear from the professionals about what’s going on in their loved one’s life. These meetings also serve as a forum for concerns to be addressed. ... The care team at my mom’s nursing home includes a nursing staff member, the activity director, the dietician and the social worker. They’ll tell me about various issues, such as whether Mom’s weight is stable, whether she’s experiencing any new symptoms that they are ... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7079-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7079_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 20:38:47">http://www.healthcentral.com/osteoarthritis/eorthopod/faq/captain-goalie-high-hockey-2722</link><title>I am the captain and team goalie for our local high school ice hockey team.</title><description>... I am the captain and team goalie for our local high school ice hockey team. I just had surgery to reconstruct the ligament on the inside of my knee. It's the off season so I have some time to work on a rehab program but practice begins in another two months. Will I be able to get back on the ice by then? From the very start of recovery and rehab, patients who have had this type of surgery are warned to be patient. It can take up to nine months before they can get back to full speed on the field, ice, or court. But you will be busy all that time training and likely better than ever once you do rejoin the team. What will you be doing? After surgery, early motion and strengthening are the keys to a good result. A physical therapist will guide you through the necessary exercises and offer advice regarding precautions. A hinged brace is used right away that allows protected movement. The therapist supervises and progresses the rehab program on a week-by-week basis. Usually full weight-bearin... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7079-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7079_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 20:39:18">http://www.healthcentral.com/diabetes/c/84384/47060/diabetes-hold</link><title>Diabetes Will Not Hold Me Back</title><description>... This has been a central theme throughout my twelve years of living with type 1 diabetes . I've managed to keep a positive outlook threaded between the rollercoaster of issues that face all of us diabetics everyday. I care for my disease to the best of my ability because I desire a long and healthy future. ... The words of my nurse at the hospital when I was diagnosed at the age of fourteen still resonate in my mind nearly everyday. "There will be a cure in your lifetime." I believed her then and twelve years later the belief remains. With so many wonderful doctors, engineers, chemists, biologists, organizations, websites, advocates and bloggers pushing for advancements in the disease, I am confident that type 1 diabetes is one of the few diseases whose eradication will occur in my lifetime. ... Diabetes does not hold me back.
