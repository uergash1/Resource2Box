As the world remembers the work and legacy of Senator Edward Kennedy, many are focused on his work to promote health care for all who need it here in the United States.  Some disagreed with his aim, but few could really question the source of his passion.  He expressed the passion of a parent whose son is asthmatic.  That son, Patrick Kennedy (now a Congressman from Rhode Island) had serious asthma as a child.  According to Senator Kennedy, Patrick sometimes had to be rushed to the hospital for treatment.  While tending to Patrick and his other sick children (son Teddy was stricken with bone cancer, and Kara had lung cancer), Sen. Kennedy said that he wondered: “What chance does my child have if I can only afford half of the prescribed treatments?  Or two thirds?  I've sold everything.  I've mortgaged as much as possible.  No parent should suffer that torment.  Not in this country.  Not in the richest country in the world.&amp;r... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7218-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7218_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 07:06:47">http://www.healthcentral.com/breast-cancer/c/2385/28431/sen-kennedy</link><title>Sen. Kennedy and the Brain Tumor: Zebras, Not Horses</title><description>...   ... Well, Sen. Edward Kennedy wound up with a zebra. ...   ... After his seizure last week, many doctors suggested it may not have been a serious episode at all and might have no lasting effects. Seizures, they said, can be the result of medication reactions, undiagnosed diabetes, alcohol withdrawal, dehydration or an infection. ...   ... The Merck Manual says seizures can be triggered by emotional or physical stress, sleep deprivation and fever. ...   ... Seizures are linked to strokes, but Kennedy's physician and many experts seemed fairly confident that his seizure was not triggered by a stroke. ...   ... Which is to say: People were listening--and probably hoping--for horses. ...   ...

It was with great pain that I heard about your 2006 affair with Rielle Hunter, the woman who produced some of your campaign Internet videos. (Ironically, videos in which you touted your moral standards… sigh.) OK, a politician cheating on his wife isn’t something new. History tells us that Thomas Jefferson fathered a number of children out of wedlock; Grover Cleveland admitted to an illegitimate son; heck, Warren Harding’s mistress visited him right there in the White House. And then of course there’s the Monica-Bill saga. No, your news isn’t shocking in the way it might be were we not so used to powerful public figures cavorting and getting caught. But John, there are a couple of things here that make me extra sad. You placed such an emphasis in your campaigns on family values and morals. You once laughingly said that, strange for a Democrat, you actually espoused them. Now we know we shouldn’t have been laughing. And the thing that really kicks me... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7218-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7218_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 07:07:57">http://www.healthcentral.com/migraine/poetry-contest/poems-37771-5.html</link><title>The Monster Within</title><description>...   Even as I speak of it, or read or simply write The thought just makes me weak with it, as it lingers to incite... For sometimes it slowly creeps, as its dreadful plumage begins-.. As it wakes me from my sleep, and calls the monster from within. A brutal intruder, to say the least, that grows inside my head A random neurological beast, that sends me to my bed-- So I battle the depleting invasion, and attempt to take control Armed with numerous equations, before it takes my weary soul. And with spiritual guidance, meds and books, my health I will defend- I fight with any type of hooks, to destroy the monster within!    Then with every single day I gain, with no headache or hurt in me. I am proud to have conquered the pain, and set the monster free! And I live with the hope and high belief, that all who know this pain- Will rid the monster and find relief, from this hurt they call a Migraine!     Next: Mr. Cluster's Movin' In!   ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7218-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7218_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 07:08:25">http://www.healthcentral.com/migraine/migraineurs-462292-5.html</link><title>John F. Kennedy's Migraines - A Secret?</title><description>... John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts. During his short tenure as our 35th and youngest President, he created the Peace Corp, tackled the Cuban Missile Crisis, proposed a new Civil Rights Bill to Congress and promoted advancement in space exploration. All of this while he suffered Migraines and other ailments. Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy and John Francis Fitzgerald Kennedy of Irish descent, had a large family - nine children in all. JFK was the second oldest and a fairly sick child. He had measles, chicken pox, whooping cough and a bout with scarlet fever during 1920, which back then, was considered life-threatening. It is also reported he suffered gastrointestinal issues and fatigue as a child. His health issues plagued him throughout his entire life. JFK and his older brother Joe, attended Harvard, where both men were considered smart, friendly, and likeable. They played football together when Kennedy sustaine... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7218-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7218_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 07:08:46">http://www.healthcentral.com/breast-cancer/c/78/28428/kennedy-biggest</link><title>Senator Kennedy's Brain Cancer Fight is Much Like the Breast Cancer Fight</title><description>... It takes just a single moment to change your life forever. It happens in that instant when the doctor looks you in the eye and hesitates, just a fraction of a second, then tries to steel himself to report bad news. It happens when sadness falls like night on the face of the nurse or social worker or radiologist with the doctor. It happens when your partner suddenly grips your hand, hard, as you both hear the news. You have cancer. Senator Ted Kennedy got that news today. The seizure that he suffered Saturday morning became, this afternoon, a malignant brain tumor. Kennedy, who’s represented the state of Massachusetts in the Senate for nearly half a century, has a glioma (tumor) in the left parietal lobe of his brain, according to a report from sources at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where he was airlifted last weekend from his home on Cape Cod. Translation: Sen. Kennedy has a brain tumor that, barring a miracle, will eventually end his life.

And we cancer survivors, those of us who daily battle the long-lasting effects of this vicious disease, have lost our champion. ... I use the word champion here as a verb, as in someone who champions a cause. Because if ever the issue of health care for all Americans had a champion, it was Ted Kennedy – the Lion of the Senate. ... His mantra, words Americans heard him repeat over and over again throughout his 47-year Senate career, was this: ... “Health care is a fundamental right for all, not just an expensive privilege for the few.” ... I think about those words today, as Ted is laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. And I consider what they mean to us, members of the breast cancer community. ... Health care for all means not having to make a choice between eating, putting a roof over your head, and finding out why there’s a lump growing in your breast. ... Universal health care means you can lose your job, and still have the mastectomy... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7218-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7218_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 07:09:36">http://www.healthcentral.com/allergy/c/48542/72574/advocacy-committee</link><title>Robert F.

Kennedy Jr., member of the Board of Directors of the Food Allergy Initiative (FAI), announced the formation of FAI’s new Advocacy Steering Committee. The committee’s objectives are to build a nationwide network of advocates to raise the profile of life threatening food allergies and to actively seek increased federal funding for food allergy research. ... ... Mr. Kennedy said that “FAI is tremendously honored and grateful to have such an esteemed group of parents who are willing to join our effort to find a cure. These parents are proven advocates and support group leaders in their local communities.   We are thrilled to add their energy and expertise to our advocacy program.” ... ...

What do U.S. Senators Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) have in common? Not their choice of which Presidential candidate to stump for, certainly. Not gender. Not geography. But they do have a common interest: cancer. Senator Kennedy for obvious reasons: he has an inoperable brain tumor. Senator Hutchison for unknown reasons—she has no apparent personal connection with cancer. But she’s been a long-time Congressional advocate for cancer research funding and other cancer-friendly initiatives, including sponsorship of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program.  In fact, last year Hutchison received the Capitol Dome Award from the American Cancer Society, in recognition of her 2005 sponsorship of the Patient Navigator, Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act, signed into law by President Bush in 2005. This legislation connects the medically underserved (low-income, uninsured, racial and ethnic minorities, and rural p... ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
