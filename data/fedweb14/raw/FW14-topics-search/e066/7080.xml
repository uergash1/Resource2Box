"Why is this night different from all other nights?" the youngest child traditionally asks at the Seder, the meal that celebrates the Jewish Passover. ...   ... "You shall tell your child on that day, saying, 'It is because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt,'" says the Book of Exodus. The Seder, in effect, is a dialogue in which children are encouraged to ask questions of their elders. There are four more formal questions, including this one: ...   ... “Why is it that on all other nights we eat all kinds of vegetables, but on this night we eat bitter herbs?” ...   ... The bitter herbs, the elder will reply, is a reminder of the bitterness of slaver... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7080-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7080_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 20:40:33">http://www.healthcentral.com/diabetes/c/17/149104/telcare-reporting</link><title>Telcare: A Good Call for Reporting Blood Glucose</title><description>... Right along with the theme of ringing in the new year, I want to tell you about the latest in blood glucose testing devices. It’s called Telcare. Its unique calling is how it instantaneously sends the good news about my managed low glucose sugar readings via wireless cell phone technology directly to my password-protected web page account. Most importantly, it sends my BG data automatically, without any additional buttons to push. Now that’s a good call. I don’t want to be bothered and burdened to learn how to work my new gadgets. I like it when they’re well designed and instantly user friendly, like my iPad and Kindle. ... The device at first glance is simple and easy to use. Identical in size and thickness to a deck of cards, it has a large 1.5” x 2” colorful and pleasant digital screen. However, like a cell phone, it runs on a rechargeable battery and consequently needs to get plugged in and recharged. Perhaps that wouldn't be so handy to use on my ... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7080-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7080_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 20:41:25">http://www.healthcentral.com/breast-cancer/c/96484/123558/follicles</link><title>HAIR FOLLICLES ON ICE</title><description>... The phone lines at Penguin Cold Caps are ringing off the hook, or in business speak, "we are currently experiencing a high volume of calls due to our appearance on Good Morning America". While the producer/supplier of the cold caps was not named in the GMA story, the idea that an icy head cap might prevent chemotherapy-induced hair loss seems to have sent some women running for the phone. ... While still in clinical trials and little known in the United States, chemotherapy cold caps have been more widely used and studied in Europe. The headgear is stored at temperatures well below freezing and worn before, during and after chemotherapy sessions. The freezing temperature constricts the blood vessels supplying blood to the hair follicles, thereby limiting the ability of the follicles to absorb the chemotherapy drugs. ... "You essentially put the hair follicles in hibernation," said Shirley Billigmeier, breast cancer survivor and co-founder of The Rapunzel Project, a non-profit with a mis... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7080-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7080_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 20:42:02">http://www.healthcentral.com/adhd/c/8689/88455/tips-procrastination</link><title>Five Tips for Beating Procrastination</title><description>... ... It's amazing how when you're procrastinating, all of a sudden the other things that you've been putting off get prioritized really high. "I can't believe that I haven't gotten around to mixing the coyote urine," I said to myself virtuously a few minutes ago. (Yes, I said coyote urine. If you live somewhere that we do, where deer get really hungry in the summer due to lack of rain and you happen to have some tasty plants, you probably know what I mean.

Hunger Hormones and Weight Regain Most people do not like to diet. I would say that all people do not like to diet, but I’ll concede that there must be at least a few hardy souls out there who derive a certain pleasure from feeling hungry. I’ve never actually met one, but they must statistically exist. It is similar to finding those fabled crows that are some other color than black. If we should achieve our weight loss goals, it is particularly disheartening to gain all those pounds back. Grabbing the gold ring is great, dropping and losing it is not. Equally disheartening is the discovery that the weight regained may be the result of a betrayal by an ally. Our own bodies may very well have ambushed us, and leading the revolution were the culprits ghrelin and leptin . Although this duo may have names that suggest hobbits and elves, they are actually hunger hormones . What are Ghrelin and Leptin? A group of Australian scientists discovered a few years back that hunger hor... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7080-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7080_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 20:44:09">http://www.healthcentral.com/chronic-pain/c/65520/40782/blessed</link><title>So, so blessed...</title><description>... ...  Hello everyone! I was just thinking about how much I actually have been blessed. My dear mother has been in horrible pain with a tooth that she had a root canal on last year. And yet she still fights for my health. I wish that I could one day have the privilage to be a mother such as she. This weekend our church hosted our 6th annual east coast ladies conference. There were several states represented. Even a group of ladies from a church in California came! It was so exciting. The speakers were amazing. Our theme was wild and wonderful West Virginia hillbillies. I'm really really worn out. Mom and I had to go home early because I jusst got way to sore. On of my fellow painiacs that I go to church made her first CD. She has an amazing voice. She suffers from RA. I would say that she was in her therties or fourties. Alot of my friends are older than I. Sometimes the other teens are just too rough for me to hang around. I find that the folks older than I usually understand my issu... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7080-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7080_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 20:44:52">http://www.healthcentral.com/schizophrenia/c/5741/99062/christmas</link><title>Merry Christmas</title><description>...   ... The stress, pressure and the guilt of buying presents will be over today. I, too have had stress and guilt over the past week or so. ...   ... Its unfortunate that Christmas is more about retail than the birth of Christ. I won't preach here. I wrote 10 things I am giving the Lord for this day. I sealed it in an envelope and will not open it till next Christmas to see how well I've done or not done. ...   ... Last nite around 7pm the doorbell rang. It doesn't ring that time of night. I got dressed and went to the door. I didn't see anyone. I looked own and there was a plate, 3 tennis balls and a card on the top step. I brought them in. The card was from the missionaries from the church. They thanked us for being nice to them. The plate was filled with brownies for us and the tennis balls for the dogs. Tears filled my eyes, they are now too. What a nice gesture. ...   ... I haven't been the best person of late... Towards myself. I am sad for the things I'... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7080-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7080_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 20:45:21">http://www.healthcentral.com/depression/c/932594/76391/supanova-idea</link><title>Supanova - my idea of a fun day out</title><description>...   ...

But I am tired, and I am tired of feeling this unusual tired. Profound tired. ... Being two-thirds through radiation is not like being two-thirds getting a pedicure... you know, you have five things on your list to hit after this pedicure is finished, all before swooping into your garage like a bat outta hell carrying armloads of packages at once so you don't have to make two trips to the garage. And why is it MY pedicurist has to answer the phone today. Usually this takes 45 minutes and I have already been in this chair 45 minutes and she doesn't even have the cuticles done yet and I need to go... ... Did I really ever have those internal conversations? Yes, and I will again. I will try to stop myself and not, but, well, I'm not perfect. You all know that by now! ... Getting back to radiation. Two thirds of the way through is fantastic. Then I look up and out.

Today I slept in late, had a nice, leisurely breakfast and cup of coffee, and I am  about to embark on a whirlwind cleaning project of my home.  My 3 year-old is with her Dad, my 2 oldest girls will be home for college in 4 days and life is very good right now.  I want to tell anyone who is thinking about a SAD light that i bought a PER3 light from Naturebright.  It broke within one week.  I left an e-mail and was answered quickly, courteously, and received a light in 4 days...and I think it helps.  I don't jolt awake to my alarm, heart pounding, and dread that noise. So i will give them a plug...and I do believe in the time I used it that it helps.      I am so excited about seeing my children again.  The holidays just wouldn't be the same without their college stories and terrifying antics. My house will be full and my grocery bill will blossom but I just want to hear their voices arguing over who won The Lord Of The Rin... ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
