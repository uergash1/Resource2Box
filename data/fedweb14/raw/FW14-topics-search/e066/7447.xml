Buying your first pair of running shoes can either be an exciting endeavor or your worst nightmare. Upon entering the strange world that is the running store, you see billions of brightly-colored, psychedelically-patterned shoes lining the walls that offer up other curious gizmos like anti-chafing sticks, tubes of edible goo and belts made out of water bottles. More than you bargained for. You snap out of your daze as the perky salesperson approaches. “What can I help you find?” Um…shoes…that fit…? ...   ... The walls and walls of shoes is a result of more and more people having gotten into running over the past decade. Athletic shoe companies have responded to the increasing demand by supplying the consumer with unlimited options, but for the novice runner, it’s almost impossible to know where to start. As someone who’s taken quite a few friends to buy their first pair of running shoes, I know this situation all too well. Fortunately,... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7447-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7447_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 19:59:30">http://www.healthcentral.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/c/311516/134576/rh</link><title>Rheumatoid Arthritis and Shoes: No Love Affair with Shoes</title><description>...   ... Although not necessarily my friends, I have found a few pairs of shoes that have become companions that I can rely on.  These simple pairs of shoes can be worn knowing that the pain won't be as extreme as with other shoes.   I found my first pair in 2008 after my husband found me crying at the computer.  I was sure I was destined for a life of "grandma" shoes.  His search found something different.  He found a shoe store in the Chicago area that specializes in or... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7447-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7447_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 19:59:46">http://www.healthcentral.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/c/568286/136420/put</link><title>Put A Little Spring In Your Step: RA And Shoes</title><description>...   ... Yesterday was an absolutely beautiful day in southeastern Michigan. It was sunny and almost 80 degrees. I decided to go for a run, which really means that ... I would run one block and then walk two or three. ...   ... Today it is cooler and rainy, and my hips are killing me. Not the smartest thing. ...   ... But I will say, I bought a pair of Skechers Shape Ups and I love them. I was just wearing regular gym shoes yesterday, but I usually wear the Skechers when I do my workout DVD. Not only do I feel that they improve my posture, but I feel like my joint mobility is better, like I kick higher. They are very cushy, and they distribute my weight more evenly than regular shoes. ...   ... This isn't meant to be an advertisement. I am not getting anything for dropping the brand name. ...   ...

Anyone who plays sports or exercises regularly knows that it’s important to stretch, warm up and cool down, wear the proper clothes and keep hydrated.  It’s also important to have the right gear, especially people with special orthopedic problems, like people with rheumatoid arthritis.  It’s important to buy shoes from a store with knowledgeable sales people who really know what the shoe’s bells and whistles do.  And it’s important to see a podiatrist and/or physical therapist when problems or pain start. In January, I wrote about my New Year’s resolution to actually lose weight and exercise more.  I joined a gym and have been fairly good about working out 2-4 times per week for 1-2 hours.  Sometimes I walk 1-2 miles around a local lake.  I do various things at my gym, usually either swimming, rowing, treadmill or elliptical trainer and lifting light weights. I’ve even built up to jogging ½ to ¾ of a mile during my walks.  In the past five months, I ... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7447-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7447_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 20:00:25">http://www.healthcentral.com/diet-exercise/c/896502/117755/research</link><title>New Research Indicates That Claims About Toning Shoes May Not Toe the Fitness Line</title><description>...     However, a new study by the American Council on Exercise has caused me to reevaluate this potential purchase.

How important are shoes for people like me with knee arthritis? Is there a best shoe you can recommend? Proper shoe wear has always been touted as being important by the experts. Our experience is that good shoe wear makes good sense but some people seem to benefit more than others. In some cases, people with worn out shoes that offer little to no support have no symptoms and no problems. Others have to replace their shoes as soon as any wear causes an uneven support base. It's unclear why there is such a wide range of responses. Some people may just have a more sensitive sense of proprioception (sense of joint position) that signals change immediately. In a recent study from Canada two groups of adults with knee osteoarthritis were compared wearing two different kinds of shoes. The first group had on a high-end walking shoe by New Balance. The second group had a special medical training device called Masai Barefoot Technology ® (MBT®). The MBT is designed to increase muscle activity in t... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7447-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7447_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 20:00:55">http://www.healthcentral.com/osteoarthritis/eorthopod/faq/special-shoe-insert-knee-2031</link><title>I'm going to get a special shoe insert to help my knee pain.</title><description>... Ask your therapist, podiatrist, or orthotist to look at your current shoe wear to see if a new shoe is needed.

I have been going cold turkey off EffexorSR for.. well... I don't know how long for, because I have totally lost track of time - but let's say 2 weeks - that's about right. ...   ... I wouldn't recommend going on this drug in the first place - or, if you have researched the drug and its effects and spoken seriously with your doctor, friends, family and believe the drug is necessary - prepare for a lifetime on it.  I don't mean this to be taken in a negative way.  Simply, the drug is soooo damm hard to quit cold turkey, or even slowly, that if it is needed - just be prepared to stay on it. ...   ...
