NO JOKE.</title><description>...   ... My left breast is all cut up, and my trusty canine finds Skittles bite-size candies, Starbursts and Tootsie rolls and eats them and almost dies!!! My back yard neighbor had a pinata party and the candy was hiding in the grass. We didn't see the chewed up pieces until we put our heads together to figure out why Luna was so sick. ...   ... What! My DOG was going to DIE!!!! Leaving me to face my breast cancer without any warm lovies! WHAT!!!!???? ...   ... So Friday., after Thanksgiving, at 2AM, we are at the Animal Hospital using the last of our money to get a liquid infusion, antibiotics, and some anti-vomiting meds...waiting for her to come back to me from the door of death. ...   ... I was beside myself. She had a seizure in my arms, went limp and I thought that was it. Then we watched as she came to, dry-heaved her last liquids, and I thought "we are watching my dog die!" Dylan and I were crying, and didn't think anything could be worse than this: tot... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7485-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7485_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 21:54:25">http://www.healthcentral.com/breast-cancer/c/8621/25829/party</link><title>The Party</title><description>...   ... No, this party was different.  This party was a good-luck-on-your-upcoming-double- mastectomy-and-reconstruction party.  And while it had all the trappings of a normal party -- lasagna, a few pot-luck salads, drinks, kids running around -- it wasn't, for all the obvious reasons, a normal party at all. ...   ... The party's guest of honor was a woman named Jen -- a friend of a close friend of mine also named Jen -- who had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer.  My friend Jen had asked me if I'd be willing to talk to her friend Jen and before I knew it the New Jen and I were exchan... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7485-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7485_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 21:54:40">http://www.healthcentral.com/multiple-sclerosis/c/38964/156528/late</link><title>All these late parties and my monster</title><description>...   ... The truth about my journey with MS is that I just don't know where my body will be on any given day/night so things like parties, community walks (I just canceled out of one), late night events or events where I'll be standing a lot have to take on the 'tentative' nature. The truth is that if I have a relaxing day with naps and no ... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7485-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7485_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 21:55:00">http://www.healthcentral.com/osteoporosis/c/310478/152132/relcast</link><title>relcast what a joke and the jokes on me</title><description>... i reluctently and recently, probably 2 1/2 mths now, had the reclast infusion, my oncololgist suggested it last year , i was against it, once its in you, no turning back.  so then my rheumotologist suggested it and i gave in. now 2mths later, i developed HBP. i never had HBP my whole life, its always been normal low. my heartrate is eratic amoung other new symptoms, like muscular weaknes, short of breath. i mention these because i like to hike and never would be sooo out of breath as i was just recently. these symptoms, signs are all new. i am very disgusted and worried, hoping that in a years time and then some, will the reclast leave the body. too me, its like having a chemo treatment, not as toxic, but toxic enough to raise ones blood pressure to be in hytensive state.

Things have been a bit serious around here. It's time to lighten up and retell an old joke... I've sure gotten old. I've had two by-pass surgeries. A hip replacement and new knees. Fought prostate cancer, and diabetes. I'm half blind and can't hear anything quieter than a jet engine. I take 40 different medications that make me dizzy, winded or subject to blackouts. I have bouts with dementia. I have poor circulation and can hardly feel my hands and feet. I can't remember if I'm 85 or 92, and I have lost all my friends. Thank God, I still have my Florida driver's license! Got any good ones that mention diabetes? Share them with everyone by adding the joke as a comment here. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7485-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7485_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 21:55:59">http://www.healthcentral.com/migraine/c/1070/82445/hat-joke</link><title>what a joke</title><description>...   ... as expected the MRI was normal.......... but the neurologist who i thought might actually help me turned out to be a joke. ...   ... he had a med student with him, and she was 10 times worse than he ever dard to be. he told her i had no known triggers...

Last week American Idol had their annual Idol Gives Back program.  If you haven’t seen it, they bring dozens of top celebrities together for a two-and-a-half hour live show to raise money for charities in the U.S. and Africa.  Later that night Jimmy Kimmel, on his late-night TV show, was talking about Idol Gives Back .  He said, “This year they estimate they raised $100 million, which will be divided between a variety of good causes: fighting malaria, Save the Children, and the search for a cure for whatever’s wrong with Paula.”  Of course he was referring to Paula Abdul. His “joke” got a big laugh from the audience, but not from me.  I’m tired of comedians and, even worse, serious journalists intimating that Ms. Abdul is whacked out on drugs because of one or two incidents (taken out of context) where she appeared to be acting a little strangely.  The fact is Paula Abdul has Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (also known... ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
