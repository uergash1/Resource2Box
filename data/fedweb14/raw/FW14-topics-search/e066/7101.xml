Alternative Names GVHD Prevention Before a transplant, your blood type and tissue type will be carefully matched with eligible donors. This matching will reduce the risk of GVHD. Whenever possible, donations from closely matched family members can further decrease the risk of this problem. Absolute prevention of GVHD is not possible, and it is a risk when receiving a transplant from anyone else. References Hoffman R, Benz EJ, Shattil SS, et al, eds.

Alternative Names GVHD Symptoms Symptoms in both acute and chronic GVHD range from mild to severe. Common acute symptoms include: Abdominal pain or cramps Diarrhea Fever Jaundice Skin rash Vomiting Weight loss Chronic symptoms may include: Dry eyes and dry mouth Hair loss Hepatitis Lung and digestive tract disorders Skin rash Skin thickening In both acute and chronic GVHD, the patient is very vulnerable to infections. Signs and tests The tests done usually depend on the symptoms, but may include: Gastrointestinal endoscopy , with or without a biopsy Liver function tests (AST, ALP, and bilirubin levels will be increased) Liver biopsy (if the patient only has liver symptoms) Lung x-rays Skin biopsy ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7101-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7101_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 22:29:59">http://www.healthcentral.com/ency/408/001309.html</link><title>Graft-versus-host disease overview</title><description>... Definition Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a complication that can occur after a stem cell or bone marrow transplant in which the newly transplanted material attacks the transplant recipient's body. See also: Transplant rejection Alternative Names GVHD Causes, incidence, and risk factors GVHD occurs in a bone marrow or stem cell transplant involving a donor and a recipient. The bone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones that helps form blood cells, including white cells that are responsible for the immune response . Stem cells are normall found inside bone marrow. Since only identical twins have identical tissue types, a donor's bone marrow is normally a close, but not perfect, match to the recipient's tissues. See: Histocompatibility antigen test The differences between the donor's cells and recipient's tissues often cause T cells (a type of white blood cells) from the donor to recognize the recipient's body tissues as foreign. When this happens, the newly transplanted cells attack the t... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7101-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7101_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 22:30:32">http://www.healthcentral.com/ency/408/001309trt.html</link><title>Graft-versus-host disease treatment</title><description>... Alternative Names GVHD Treatment The goal of treatment is to suppress the immune response without damaging the new cells. Medicines commonly used include methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, ATG, and alemtuzumab either alone or in combination. High-dose corticosteroids are the most effective treatment for acute GVHD. Antibodies to T cells and other medicines are given to patients who do not respond to steroids. Treatment of chronic GVHD includes prednisone (a steroid) with or without cyclosporine. Other treatments include mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), sirolimus (Rapamycin), and tacrolimus (Prograf). Support Groups Expectations (prognosis) How well a person does depends on the severity of the condition. Some cases of GVHD can lead to death. Many cases, whether acute or chronic, can be treated successfully. Sometimes treatment of the condition can lead to severe complications. Successful treatment of GVHD does not guarantee that the transplant itself will succeed in treating the... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7101-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7101_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 22:31:30">http://www.healthcentral.com/ency/408/imagepages/19616.html</link><title>Laceration versus puncture wound</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7101-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7101_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 22:31:54">http://www.healthcentral.com/asthma/introduction-6725-146.html</link><title>Normal versus asthmatic bronchiole</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7101-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7101_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 22:32:19">http://www.healthcentral.com/chronic-pain/c/23153/33144/medications</link><title>Sustained Release Versus Immediate Release Medications: Which Works Best?</title><description>...   ... Immediate release medications are designed for occasional, temporary pain because they work fast but don't last. This allows a person to use these short-acting medications like Vicodin , Lortab , and Percocet "as needed for pain" (this is a common instruction on prescription bottles). However, many people end up using quick-acting medications constantly, around-the-clock for 24/7 pain. That is like trying to use a hammer as if it were a nail.  Immediate release medications are the wrong tools for the job of controlling constant pain. Because these medications wear-off so quickly, one never has a chance to stay ahead of the pain. Instead, this roller coaster... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7101-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7101_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 22:32:53">http://www.healthcentral.com/chronic-pain/c/question/860649/100074</link><title>Please compare and contrast Roxicet 5-325 versus Hydroco APAP5 500.</title><description>...
