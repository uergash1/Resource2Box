Tea is not the only ancient remedy for lowering cholesterol that has gained popularity over the past years. Red yeast rice is a food that has been a part of Asian culture for thousands of years. Red yeast rice is simply rice that has been allowed to ferment in the red yeast Monascus purpureus . This fermentation gives the rice a reddish color and spicier flavor, which is commonly used in Asian cooking. The Chinese have known about its health benefits for over a millennium and ancient Chinese textbooks mention the use of red yeast rice for treating indigestion, diarrhea, and circulatory problems. Modern day science has now confirmed that red yeast rice does, in fact, lower cholesterol and may have benefit in reducing heart disease risk. ... When rice is fermented in the red yeast, chemical compounds called monacolins are produced. Monacolins have the ability to inhibit the production of cholesterol mainly by acting on the liver. One monacolin in particular called monacolin K is known ... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7014-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7014_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 03:04:17">http://www.healthcentral.com/skin-cancer/c/115/7017/skin-skin-crack</link><title>Skin Cancer and Darker Skin: Oprah's Comment that "Black Doesn't Crack"</title><description>... Each week, Health and Beauty Expert Sue Chung will discuss skin health topics suggested by members of the HealthCentral community. To ask Sue a question, send an email to feedback@skincancerconnection.com . Reader's Question: If I have darker skin, do I need to worry about sunscreen? I never burn and I've heard darker skin has natural sun protection.   Sue's Response: I caught an episode of Oprah last week. Normally, it's simply entertaining. I love watching her give away free goodies and trips to Disneyland. However, the one I caught last week was meant to be less entertaining and more informative. Dr. Mehmet Oz, Oprah's resident go-to medical advisor, appeared in some snazzy scrubs and answered a variety of health questions that pertain to women. At one point in the episode, entitled "Oz on Call," one woman asked if her tanning habit was really that dangerous. During this discussion, Oprah referred to the cultural perception that "black doesn't... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7014-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7014_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 03:05:08">http://www.healthcentral.com/breast-cancer/c/question/976129/60122</link><title>I am 30-year-old Asian/American woman.

Next, the health care provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm. Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and ... ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
