Acne usually develops when the sebaceous glands and the lining of the hair follicle begin to work overtime, as they do in adolescence. Normally, the lining of the hair follicle sheds cells that are carried to the surface of the skin by the sebum.

If the plug enlarges and pops out of the duct, it is called an "open" comedo or blackhead because the top is dark. This is not dirt and will not wash away. The discoloration is due to the way light is absorbed by the skin cells within the openi... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7328-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7328_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 13:56:40">http://www.healthcentral.com/skin-care/c/1443/147267/holiday-worsen</link><title>Will Holiday Meals Worsen Your Acne?</title><description>...   ... When you eat greasy, fatty foods, the grease doesn't suddenly appear on your face, but that doesn't mean that what you eat doesn't affect your complexion. Acne is caused by a build-up of excess oils which clogs pores, allowing bacteria to grow. Once that happens, your immune system takes over, creating inflammation - which appears as a red spot and then a pimple. ...   ...

Don't pay for the packaging ... or for big-name celebrity endorsements. What's inside your tube of acne cream is more important than fancy packaging or having a famous celebrity to promote it. Prescription acne medications are not only more effective; they're usually less expensive than heavily publicized mail-order treatments. For example, Proactiv contains the same ingredients you'll find in a five dollar drugstore "zit cream" but carries a hefty price tag that reflects the multi-million dollar cost of the celebrities who are paid to endorse it. This New York Times article discusses how Proactiv raked in 850 million dollars last year "by motivating consumers to trade up from a $4.99 drugstore product like Clearasil, made with the antibacterial agent benzoyl peroxide, to a 60-d... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e066-7328-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e066/7328_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-26 13:57:37">http://www.healthcentral.com/skin-care/c/question/371438/90536</link><title>I am sick of acne.It gets worst and worst.
