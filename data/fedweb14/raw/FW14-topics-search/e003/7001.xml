The ratio of the top-quark branching fractions $R = B(t \to Wb)/B(t \to Wq)$, where the denominator includes the sum over all down-type quarks (q = b, s, d), is measured in the $t\bar{t}$ dilepton final state with proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV from an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse-femtobarns, collected with the CMS detector.

In high-energy collisions, the spatio-temporal size of the particle production region can be measured using the Bose-Einstein correlations of identical bosons at low relative momentum. The source radii are typically extracted using two-pion correlations, and characterize the system at the last stage of interaction, called kinetic freeze-out. [...]

The yields of the K*(892)0 and phi(1020) resonances are measured in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV through their hadronic decays using the ALICE detector. The measurements are performed in multiple centrality intervals at mid-rapidity (|y|&lt;0.5) in the transverse-momentum ranges 0.3&lt;pT&lt;5 GeV/c for the K*(892)0 and 0.5&lt;pT&lt;5 GeV/c for the phi(1020).

The transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}$) distribution for inclusive neutral pions in the very forward rapidity region has been measured, with the Large Hadron Collider forward detector (LHCf), in proton--lead collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$TeV at the LHC. The $p_\text{T}$ spectra obtained in the rapidity range $-11.0 &lt; y_\text{lab} &lt; -8.9$ and $0 &lt; p_\text{T} &lt; 0.6$GeV (in the detector reference frame) show a strong suppression of the production of neutral pions after taking into account ultra-peripheral collisions.

Searches for the electroweak production of charginos, neutralinos and sleptons in final states characterized by the presence of two leptons (electrons and muons) and missing transverse momentum are performed using 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$=8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.
