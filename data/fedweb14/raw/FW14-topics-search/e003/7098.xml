We show that all undesired gauge dependence in the Weinberg-Salam model can be eliminated by a mere change of variables, without any explicit gauge fixing. The change of variables introduces a separation between the isospin and the hypercharge. [...]

This paper presents the final interpretation of the results from DELPHI on the searches for Higgs bosons in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). A few representative scenarios are considered, that include CP conservation and explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector. [...]

The quark model does not exclude states composed of more than three quarks, like pentaquark systems. Controversial evidence for such states has been published in the last years, in particular: for a strange pentaquark Theta(1540)+; for a double-strange state, the Xi(1862)--, subsequently called Phi(1860)--; and for a charmed state, the Theta_c(3100)^0.

Neutral triple-gauge-boson couplings ZZZ, ZZgam and Zgamgam have been studied with the DELPHI detector using data at energies between 183 and 208 GeV. Limits are derived on these couplings from an analysis of the reactions e+e- -&gt; Zgam, using data from the final states gamma f fbar, with f = q or neutrino, from e+e- -&gt; ZZ, using data from the four-fermion final states q qbar q qbar, q qbar mu+ mu-, q qbar e+ e-, q qbar nu nubar, mu+ mu- nu nubar and e+ e- nu nubar, and from e+e- -&gt; Zgam*, in which the final state gamma is off mass-shell, using data from the four-fermion final states q qbar e+ e- and q qbar mu+ mu-.

Measurements of Zgamma* production are presented using data collected by the DELPHI detector at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 183 to 209 GeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 667 pb^{-1}. The measurements cover a wide range of the possible final state four-fermion configurations: hadronic and leptonic (e+ e- q qbar, mu+ mu- q qbar, q qbar nu nubar), fully leptonic (l+ l- l'+ l'-) and fully hadronic final states (q qbar q qbar, with a low mass q qbar pair).

In the reaction e+e- -&gt; WW -&gt; (q_1 qbar_2)(q_3 qbar_4) the usual hadronization models treat the colour singlets q_1 qbar_2 and q_3 qbar_4 coming from two W bosons independently. However, since the final state partons may coexist in space and time, cross-talk between the two evolving hadronic systems may be possible during fragmentation through soft gluon exchange. [...]
