We study the workload processes of two restricted M/G/1 queueing systems: in Model 1 any service requirement that would exceed a certain capacity threshold is truncated; in Model 2 new arrivals do not enter the system if they have to wait more than a fixed threshold time in line. [...]

Two of the most popular approximations for the distribution of the steady-state waiting time, W_infty, of the M/G/1 queue are the so-called heavy-traffic approximation and heavy-tailed asymptotic, respectively. [...]
