Introduction CMS distributed computing system performed well during the 2011 start-up. The events in 2011 have more pile-up and are more complex than last year; this results in longer reconstruction times and harder events to simulate [...]

Introduction Since the last CMS Bulletin, the CMS Collaboration has successfully achieved many milestones and the Offline Group has played a central role in the fulfillment of all of them. While many moments have been of historical importance for the whole Collaboration (the first 7 TeV collisions, the huge media coverage on March 30th, the constant increase in luminosity), we consider the level of efficient and sustained operations the group was able to reach over this period as our main achievement [...]

The main activity since spring 2009 has continued to involve integration and validation of a wide range of new features from all subsystems in a major new release series (CMSSW_3_x). Much attention has been given to optimization of both code and data formats in order to keep the cpu time, memory footprint and data storage requirements within ‘budget’ [...]

Over the last 3 months the Offline project has been focussed on the integration and validation of the CMSSW_2_1_X production release, which is the last release cycle before data-taking starts. The goal has been to include all essential missing functionality, such as the final geometry and the new magnetic field map, and to continue to extend the data quality monitoring and physics analysis capabilities of the software [...]

Overview The main focus during the summer was to handle data coming from the detector and to perform Monte Carlo production. The lessons learned during the CCRC and CSA08 challenges in May were addressed by dedicated PADA campaigns lead by the Integration team [...]
