With the advent of readily available wireless communications and small hand-held computers, commonly known as personal digital assistants (PDAs), it is interesting to consider using these portable devices to access a control system. We have successfully ported the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) to Windows CE 3.0 (WCE) for the Pocket PC (PPC), and this paper describes the issues involved. [...]
