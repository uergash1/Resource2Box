We report on the design and performance of a cryogenic (300 mK) near-field scanning microwave microscope. It uses a microwave resonator as the near-field sensor, operating at a frequency of 6 GHz and microwave probing amplitudes down to 100 uV, approaching low enough photon population (N~1000) of the resonator such that coherent quantum manipulation becomes feasible.
