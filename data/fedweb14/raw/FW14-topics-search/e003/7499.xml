We summarize and combine direct measurements of the mass of the $W$ boson in $\sqrt{s} = 1.96 \text{TeV}$ proton-antiproton collision data collected by CDF and D0 experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Earlier measurements from CDF and D0 are combined with the two latest, more precise measurements: a CDF measurement in the electron and muon channels using data corresponding to $2.2 \mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, and a D0 measurement in the electron channel using data corresponding to $4.3 \mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.

We combine searches by the CDF and D0 Collaborations for the standard model Higgs boson with mass in the range 90--200 GeV/c^2 produced in the gluon-gluon fusion, WH, ZH, ttbarH, and vector boson fusion processes, and decaying in the H-&gt;bbbar, H-&gt;W^+W^-, H-&gt;ZZ, H-&gt;\tau^+\tau^-, and H-&gt;\gamma \gamma\ modes. The data correspond to integrated luminosities of up to 10 fb^-1 and were collected at the Fermilab Tevatron in ppbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV. [...]

The combination of searches performed by the CDF and D0 collaborations at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider for neutral Higgs bosons produced in association with b quarks is reported. The data, corresponding to 2.6 fb-1 of integrated luminosity at CDF and 5.2 fb-1 at D0, have been collected in final states containing three or more b jets. [...]

We report the combination of recent measurements of the helicity of the W boson from top quark decay by the CDF and D0 collaborations, based on data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of 2.7 - 5.4 fb^-1 of ppbar collisions collected during Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Combining measurements that simultaneously determine the fractions of W bosons with longitudinal (f0) and right-handed (f+) helicities, we find f0 = 0.722 \pm 0.081 [\pm 0.062 (stat.) \pm 0.052 (syst.)] and f+ = -0.033 \pm 0.046 [\pm 0.034 (stat.) \pm 0.031 (syst.)].
