We study the Log(N)-Log(S) and X-ray luminosity function in the 2-10 keV energy band, and the spatial (3-D) distribution of bright, log(L_X) &gt; 34-35 erg/s, X-ray binaries in the Milky Way. In agreement with theoretical expectations and earlier results we found significant differences between the spatial distributions of low (LMXB) and high (HMXB) mass X-ray binaries. [...]
