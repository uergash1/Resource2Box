Considerable attention has been focused on Verlinde's recent work, claiming that Newton's gravity is not a fundamental force. [...]

A plasma blob is modeled as consisting of two homogeneous spheres of equal radius and equal but opposite charge densities that can move relative to each other. Relative translational and rotational motion are considered separately. [...]
