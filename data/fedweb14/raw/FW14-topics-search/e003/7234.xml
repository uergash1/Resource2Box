In several extensions of the Standard Model, the top quark can decay into a bottom quark and a light charged Higgs boson $H^+, t \to bH^+$, in addition to the Standard Model decay $t \to bW$. Since W bosons decay to the three lepton generations equally, while $H^+$ may predominantly decay into $\tau\nu$, charged Higgs bosons can be searched for using the violation of lepton universality in top quark decays.
