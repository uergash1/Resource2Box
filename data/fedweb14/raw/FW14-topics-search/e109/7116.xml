It is a recipe perfected over time and circumstance. Longtime Food section contributor and cookbook author Lisa Yockelson's formula combines gently pan-cooked vegetables with eggs and cheese, plus paprika and chopped parsley. Once set after a brief oven bake, a savory kind of "cake" is ready to be sliced into pie-shaped wedges. Think of the core ingredients in the recipe (eggs, vegetables, cheese) as a kind of blueprint for other permutations: swapping one kind of good melting cheese for another; using steamed-softened greens instead of mushrooms (onions are a given); or substituting snipped chives (1 to 2 tablespoons) or tender leafy oregano (1 tablespoon) for the flat-leaf parsley. See other VARIATIONS, below. You'll need a heavy, 8-inch ovenproof skillet, preferably cast-iron. If you have a 9-inch skillet, reduce the baking time to about 8 minutes. Serve with a garlicky green salad (for bacon lovers, add apple wood-smoked, thick slab bacon, grilled), and never forget how reliable that carton of eggs can be in your culinary life.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7116-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7116_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 15:37:35">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/express/post/summer-camps-that-fit-the-skill/2014/04/16/d2e9fdd0-c583-11e3-b708-471bae3cb10c_blog.html</link><title>Summer camps that fit the skill</title><description>Kids have free time over the summer.
