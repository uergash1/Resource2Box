The all-volunteer effort is geared toward customers in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Its simple, seasonal recipes call for farmers market items and inexpensive pantry ingredients. They are accompanied by handsome photographs and were curated by JuJu Harris, the culinary educator and SNAP outreach coordinator for the nonprofit Arcadia Center for Sustainable Food and Agriculture in Alexandria. The project was underwritten by Bon Appetit Management; the book is a bargain at $20. Order it online at arcadiafood.org/order-arcadia-mobile-market-seasonal-cookbook, or pick up a copy from Arcadia's Mobile Market, a school bus turned into a rolling farm stand that serves D.C. neighborhoods lacking easy access to locally grown, sustainable foods. These patties achieve a thin, crisp crust under the broiler. Canned beans are the go-to for a quick rendition, but of course home-cooked beans would be even kinder to the budget. Serve two patties with a crunchy salad, or put one in a pita or on a toasted whole-wheat bun.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7166-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 09:03:53">http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/carbs-and-me-were-inseparable/2014/02/10/ec4daf14-893e-11e3-916e-e01534b1e132_story.html</link><title>Carbs and me: We're inseparable</title><description>A love letter to the one food that keeps him going</description><thumb cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_02_thumb.jpg">http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_145x100/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/02/10/Food/Images/icon-carbs.jpg</thumb></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7166-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 09:05:07">http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/recipes/panino-di-pizza-cauliflower-and-romesco/13868/</link><title>Panino di Pizza With Cauliflower and Romesco</title><description>This is where pizza dough can act like pita: You put it in a hot oven, untopped, and it rises into a dome, allowing you to slice it open and fill it like a sandwich while keeping everything much crisper than, say, a calzone. Store-bought pizza dough varies; the ones that performed best in testing for this recipe were fresh dough from the bakery/pizza station at Whole Foods Market and a frozen version by Brooklyn Pizza Dough Co., also available at Whole Foods. (Dough from Trader Joe's is wetter and bakes up more like ciabatta: chewier and less crisp, without the puff of air.) You can, of course, use a homemade dough.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7166-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 09:07:17">http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/warming-foods-for-winter/2014/01/14/ee6edcdc-77e1-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html</link><title>Warming foods for winter</title><description>There's a reason the body gravitates to certain foods in certain seasons.</description><thumb cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_04_thumb.jpg">http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_145x100/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/11/LocalLiving/Images/LL17Butternut.jpg</thumb></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7166-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 09:10:11">http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/fresh-ideas-for-school-lunches/2013/11/14/c88198e2-47f9-11e3-b6f8-3782ff6cb769_story.html</link><title>Serving up fresh ideas for school lunch</title><description>Serving food from local farms is part of a plan to get kids to eat healthfully.</description><thumb cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_05_thumb.jpg">http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_145x100/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/15/Style/Graphics/farm cover_online.jpg</thumb></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7166-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 09:11:13">http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/hints-from-heloise-holiday-meals-start-early/2013/10/29/23e51b9c-40ba-11e3-9c8b-e8deeb3c755b_story.html</link><title>Hints From Heloise: Holiday meals start early</title><description>A reader starts grocery shopping for holiday staples in the early fall, saving time and money.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7166-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 09:12:39">http://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/the-20-diner-visits-yia-yias-kitchen-in-beltsville/2013/10/30/a654b982-3d1a-11e3-a94f-b58017bfee6c_story.html</link><title>The $20 Diner visits Yia Yia's Kitchen in Beltsville</title><description>Yia Yia's is a casual Greek eatery with a grandmother's touch.</description><thumb cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_07_thumb.jpg">http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_145x100/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/29/Others/Images/2013-10-28/wkdinner00201383018667.jpg</thumb></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7166-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 09:14:58">http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/mix-bar-and-grille-pocket-friendly-in-potomac/2013/10/21/40b8c140-301d-11e3-8906-3daa2bcde110_story.html</link><title>Mix Bar and Grille: Pocket-friendly in Potomac</title><description>Eddie Benaim replaces Bezu fare with more modestly priced crowd-pleasers.</description><thumb cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_08_thumb.jpg">http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_145x100/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/12/Others/Images/2013-10-11/mix0061381550351.jpg</thumb></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7166-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 09:16:49">http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/recipes/chocolate-lamb-chili/13638/</link><title>Chocolate Lamb Chili</title><description>Lamb gives this chili a slightly gamy richness. The chocolate smooths the sauce and moves the flavor profile closer to that of a Mexican mole. The ingredient list isn't as daunting as you might think: Everything ends up in the slow-cooker, which should have at least a 5 1/2 quart capacity. Serve with rice or triangles of warm pita bread.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7166-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 09:19:15">http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/2013/10/10/660854f8-0c17-11e3-8974-f97ab3b3c677_story.html</link><title>Fall Dining Guide 2013</title><description>The Washington Post restaurant critic reviews the dining rooms you should know.</description><thumb cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7166_10_thumb.jpg">http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_145x100/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/09/19/Magazine/Images/jvscreative-kogiya-031379631677.jpg</thumb></snippet></snippets></search_results>
