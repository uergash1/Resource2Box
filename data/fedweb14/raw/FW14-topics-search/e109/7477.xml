We received more than 150 creative and adorable entries for the 2014 KidsPost Peeps Diorama Contest. The winners created a funny and colorful scene titled "What Did the Peep Say?" - an ode to the popular dance song "The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)" by the group Ylvis. All the kids who entered deserve congratulations for their set designs, attention to detail and costume choices. We were even more impressed by the artists' decision to not eat all of the Peeps needed for their dioramas.</description><thumb cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7477_07_thumb.jpg">http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_145x100/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/04/01/Production/Magazine/Images/666-what_does_the_peep_say_part.jpg</thumb></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7477-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7477_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 22:45:46">http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/rio-mayor-says-no-sports-mausoleum-like-beijing/2014/04/17/1b3f8fa2-c66d-11e3-b708-471bae3cb10c_story.html</link><title>Rio Mayor says no sports 'mausoleum' like Beijing</title><description>Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes is viewed as the key person to speed up the city's delayed Olympics Games preparations.
