Her preferred spices were simply salt and pepper. The result was hearty, earthy and a little on the heavy side. I've taken the best of Nana's dish and lightened it by using turkey tenderloins instead of brisket or short ribs. A variety of mushrooms lends sophistication, and white wine adds a little acid. I think Nana would have liked this new version. When she wasn't cooking with chicken fat, Nana used peanut oil. But olive oil works just as well. If you have homemade chicken broth, by all means use it. The more varieties of mushroom you can find, the better this dish will turn out. Wegmans carries, among others, beech, oyster and sliced king oyster mushrooms. Most Asian markets carry a wide array, and Whole Foods sells a "chef's sampler" that includes trumpet royale, forest namekos, velvet pioppini and brown clamshells. The one mushroom to avoid is the shiitake, which has an unmistakably Asian flavor that doesn't fit well into Nana's flavor profile. If you can't find turkey tenderloins, you can cut up a boneless turkey breast or substitute boneless, skinless chicken breast. This recipe can easily be doubled, but you'll have to transfer the browned turkey pieces and the mushroom-onion mixture to a large roasting pan for the final braising. If you're not making this for Passover, cornstarch may be used instead of potato starch. With cornstarch, you'll need to add the cornstarch slurry to the dish and then bring the cooking broth to a boil.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7205-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7205_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 19:01:15">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/going-out-guide/post/limepocalypse-now-bad-harvest-could-endanger-your-margaritas/2014/04/03/1c4a5066-bb4c-11e3-80de-2ff8801f27af_blog.html</link><title>Bad lime harvest puts the squeeze on bartenders</title><description>With a lime shortage causing prices to skyrocket, it's a bad time to be the owner of a Mexican restaurant.</description><thumb cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7205_08_thumb.jpg">http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_145x100/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/04/03/Others/Images/2014-04-03/limeshortage.jpg</thumb></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e109-7205-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e109/7205_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 19:02:44">http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/chat-leftovers-epazote-fresh-or-dried/2014/04/02/fa892f1c-b9d7-11e3-96ae-f2c36d2b1245_story.html</link><title>Chat Leftovers: Epazote, fresh or dried</title><description>Whether fresh or dried, this assertive Mexican herb adds a distinctive note to foods.
