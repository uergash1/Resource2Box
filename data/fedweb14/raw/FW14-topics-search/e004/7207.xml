Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

The OECD Futures Project on Risk Management Policies aims to assist OECD countries in identifying the challenges of managing risks in the 21st century, and contributing to their reflection on how best to address those challenges. Its focus is placed on the consistency of risk management policies and on their ability to deal with the challenges, present and future, created by systemic risks. It is designed in two phases. In Phase 1, the countries participating in the project propose specific themes as case studies of their risk management policies. For each proposal, the OECD Secretariat prepares an overview of the issue covering both recent international developments of interest and the national policy context. In addition, the Secretariat elaborates a tool for self-assessment and review, consisting of one or several questionnaires following the methodological framework of the project. This prepares the ground for Phase 2 in which an in-depth review of the risk management issues will be conducted by a team of experts for those countries that wish it. Self-assessments will be used as the basis of these reviews. At the end of phase 2, a crosscountry report will bring together the lessons learned from the project, and identify opportunities for sharing best practices and improving risk management.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7207-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7207_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 18:29:43">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=EA825C60DDE35CE66B070B42DA1FEA27?doi=10.1.1.382.8055&amp;rank=7</link><title>of earthquakes</title><description>of earthquakes

Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing is a novel approach to automated document indexing which is based on a statistical latent class model for factor analysis of count data. Fitted from a training corpus of text documents by a generalization of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, the utilized model is able to deal with domain-specific synonymy as well as with polysemous words. In contrast to standard Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by Singular Value Decomposition, the probabilistic variant has a solid statistical foundation and defines a proper generative data model. Retrieval experiments on a number of test collections indicate substantial performance gains over direct term matching methodsaswell as over LSI. In particular, the combination of models with different dimensionalities has proven to be advantageous.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
