This paper presents our vision of Human Computer Interaction (HCI): "Tangible Bits. " Tangible Bits allows users to "grasp &amp; manipulate " bits in the center of users’ attention by coupling the bits with everyday physical objects and architectural surfaces. Tangible Bits also enables users to be aware of background bits at the periphery of human perception using ambient display media such as light, sound, airflow, and water movement in an augmented space. The goal of Tangible Bits is to bridge the gaps between both cyberspace and the physical environment, as well as the foreground and background of human activities. This paper describes three key concepts of Tangible Bits: interactive surfaces; the coupling of bits with graspable physical objects; and ambient media for background awareness. We illustrate these concepts with three prototype systems – the metaDESK, transBOARD and ambientROOM – to identify underlying research issues.

"Grid" computing has emerged as an important new field, distinguished from conventional distributed computing by its focus on large-scale resource sharing, innovative applications, and, in some cases, high-performance orientation. In this article, we define this new field. First, we review the "Grid problem," which we define as flexible, secure, coordinated resource sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and resources---what we refer to as virtual organizations. In such settings, we encounter unique authentication, authorization, resource access, resource discovery, and other challenges. It is this class of problem that is addressed by Grid technologies. Next, we present an extensible and open Grid architecture,inwhich protocols, services, application programming interfaces, and software development kits are categorized according to their roles in enabling resource sharing. We describe requirements that we believe any such mechanisms must satisfy and we discuss the importance of defining a compact set of intergrid protocols to enable interoperability among different Grid systems. Finally, we discuss how Grid technologies relate to other contemporary technologies, including enterprise integration, application service provider, storage service provider, and peer-to-peer computing. We maintain that Grid concepts and technologies complement and have much to contribute to these other approaches.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7468-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7468_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 14:35:40">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A6CDD01A941E77E4C6FDD9A9489AA4D5?doi=10.1.1.221.2247&amp;rank=4</link><title>Wireless sensor networks: a survey</title><description>Wireless sensor networks: a survey

This paper describes the concept of sensor networks which has been made viable by the convergence of microelectro-mechanical systems technology, wireless communications and digital electronics. First, the sensing tasks and the potential sensor networks applications are explored, and a review of factors influencing the design of sensor networks is provided. Then, the communication architecture for sensor networks is outlined, and the algorithms and protocols developed for each layer in the literature are explored. Open research issues for the realization of sensor networks are</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7468-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7468_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 14:39:30">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A6CDD01A941E77E4C6FDD9A9489AA4D5?doi=10.1.1.128.1599&amp;rank=5</link><title>Volume Rendering</title><description>Volume Rendering

A technique for rendering images Of volumes containing mixtures of materials is presented. The shading model allows both the interior of a material and the boundary between materials to be colored. Image projection is performed by simulating the absorption of light along the ray path to the eye. The algorithms used are designed to avoid artifacts caused by aliasing and quantization and can be efficiently implemented on an image computer. Images from a variety of applications are shown.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7468-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7468_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 14:42:01">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A6CDD01A941E77E4C6FDD9A9489AA4D5?doi=10.1.1.126.4732&amp;rank=6</link><title>Nonrigid registration using free-form deformations: Application to breast MR images</title><description>Nonrigid registration using free-form deformations: Application to breast MR images

An increasing number of systems, from pay-TV to electronic purses, rely on the tamper resistance of smartcards and other security processors. We describe a number of attacks on such systems -- some old, some new and some that are simply little known outside the chip testing community. We conclude that trusting tamper resistance is problematic; smartcards are broken routinely, and even a device that was described by a government signals agency as `the most secure processor generally available' turns out to be vulnerable. Designers of secure systems should consider the consequences with care.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7468-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7468_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 14:46:39">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A6CDD01A941E77E4C6FDD9A9489AA4D5?doi=10.1.1.110.6657&amp;rank=8</link><title>Elephants don't play chess</title><description>Elephants don't play chess

Engineering and Computer Science at M.I.T. and a member of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory where he leads the mobile robot group. He has authored two books, numerous scientific papers, and is the editor of the International Journal of Computer Vision. There is an alternative route to Artificial Intelligence that diverges from the directions pursued under that banner for the last thirty some years. The traditional approach has emphasized the abstract manipulation of symbols, whose grounding, in physical reality has. rarely been achieved. We explore a research methodology which emphasizes ongoing physical interaction with the environment as the primary source of constraint on the design of intelligent systems. We show how this methodology has recently had significant successes on a par with the most successful classical efforts. We outline plausible future work along these lines which can lead to vastly more ambitious systems. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7468-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7468_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 14:48:00">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A6CDD01A941E77E4C6FDD9A9489AA4D5?doi=10.1.1.20.2244&amp;rank=9</link><title>The Table Lens: Merging Graphical and Symbolic Representations in an Interactive Focus+Context Visualization for Tabular Information</title><description>The Table Lens: Merging Graphical and Symbolic Representations in an Interactive Focus+Context Visualization for Tabular Information
