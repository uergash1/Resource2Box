Research on ontology is becoming increasingly widespread in the computer science community, and its importance is being recognized in a multiplicity of research fields and application areas, including knowledge engineering, database design and integration, information retrieval and extraction. We shall use the generic term information systems, in its broadest sense, to collectively refer to these application perspectives. We argue in this paper that so-called ontologies present their own methodological and architectural peculiarities: on the methodological side, their main peculiarity is the adoption of a highly interdisciplinary approach, while on the architectural side the most interesting aspect is the centrality of the role they can play in an information system, leading to the perspective of ontology-driven information systems.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7474-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7474_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 16:59:06">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=2B44E78C0D7DDD87B8C95783E32647B3?doi=10.1.1.134.208&amp;rank=5</link><title>Multiscalar Processors</title><description>Multiscalar Processors

Multiscalar processors use a new, aggressive implementation paradigm for extracting large quantities of instruction level parallelism from ordinary high level language programs. A single program is divided into a collection of tasks by a combination of software and hardware. The tasks are distributed to a number of parallel processing units which reside within a processor complex. Each of these units fetches and executes instructions belonging to its assigned task. The appearance of a single logical register file is maintained with a copy in each parallel processing unit. Register results are dynamically routed among the many parallel pro-cessing units with the help of compiler-generated masks. Memory accesses may occur speculatively without knowledge of preceding loads or stores. Addresses are disambiguated dynamically, many in parallel, and processing waits only for true data dependence. This paper presents the philosophy of the multi scalar paradigm, the structure of multiscalar programs, and the hardware architecture of a multiscalar processor. The paper also discusses performance issues in the mttltiscalar model. and compares the multiscalar paradigm with other paradigms. Experimental results evaluating the performance of a sample of multiscalar organizations are also presented. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7474-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7474_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 17:01:34">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=2B44E78C0D7DDD87B8C95783E32647B3?doi=10.1.1.15.3043&amp;rank=6</link><title>Inductive-Data-Type Systems</title><description>Inductive-Data-Type Systems

In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7474-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7474_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 17:05:57">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=2B44E78C0D7DDD87B8C95783E32647B3?doi=10.1.1.117.695&amp;rank=8</link><title>On understanding types, data abstraction, and polymorphism</title><description>On understanding types, data abstraction, and polymorphism

Our objective is to understand the notion of type in programming languages, present a model of typed, polymorphic programming languages that reflects recent research in type theory, and examine the relevance of recent research to the design of practical programming languages. Object-oriented languages provide both a framework and a motivation for exploring the interaction among the concepts of type, data abstraction, and polymorphism, since they extend the notion of type to data abstraction and since type inheritance is an important form of polymorphism. We develop a λ-calculus-based model for type systems that allows us to explore these interactions in a simple setting, unencumbered by complexities of production programming languages. The evolution of languages from untyped universes to monomorphic and then polymorphic type systems is reviewed. Mechanisms for polymorphism such as overloading, coercion, subtyping, and parameterization are examined. A unifying framework for polymorphic type systems is developed in terms of the typed λ-calculus augmented to include binding of types by quantification as well as binding of values by abstraction. The typed λ-calculus is augmented by universal quantification to model generic functions with type parameters, existential quantification and packaging (information hiding) to model abstract data types, and</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7474-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7474_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 17:06:31">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=2B44E78C0D7DDD87B8C95783E32647B3?doi=10.1.1.101.9822&amp;rank=9</link><title>Bigtable: A distributed storage system for structured data</title><description>Bigtable: A distributed storage system for structured data

Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7474-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7474_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 17:08:03">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=2B44E78C0D7DDD87B8C95783E32647B3?doi=10.1.1.157.2429&amp;rank=10</link><title>SRILM -- An extensible language modeling toolkit</title><description>SRILM -- An extensible language modeling toolkit

SRILM is a collection of C++ libraries, executable programs, and helper scripts designed to allow both production of and experimentation with statistical language models for speech recognition and other applications. SRILM is freely available for noncommercial purposes. The toolkit supports creation and evaluation of a variety of language model types based on N-gram statistics, as well as several related tasks, such as statistical tagging and manipulation of N-best lists and word lattices. This paper summarizes the functionality of the toolkit and discusses its design and implementation, highlighting ease of rapid prototyping, reusability, and combinability of tools.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
