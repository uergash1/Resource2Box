Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

Compared to listed stocks, over-the-counter (OTC) stocks are far less liquid, disclose less information, and exhibit lower institutional holdings. We exploit these different market conditions to test theories of cross-sectional return premiums. Compared to return premiums in listed markets, the OTC premium for illiquid stocks is several times higher, the OTC premiums for size, value, and volatility are similar, and the OTC premium for momentum is three times lower. The OTC premiums for illiquidity, size, value, and volatility are largest among stocks that are held almost exclusively by retail investors and those that do not disclose financial information. Theories of differences in investors ’ opinions and short sales constraints help to explain these return premiums. Our momentum results are most consistent with Hong and Stein’s (1999) theory based on the gradual diffusion of information. The authors thank Bill Aronin for making available MarketQA data.

Online survey data were collected from 30,000 users of Massively Multi-User Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) over a three year period to explore users ’ demographics, motivations and derived experiences. Not only do MMORPGs appeal to a broad age range (Mage = 26.57, range = 11-68), but the appeal is strong (on average 22 hours of usage per week) across users of all ages (r =-.04). An exploratory factor analysis revealed a five factor model of user motivations- Achievement, Relationship, Immersion, Escapism and Manipulation-illustrating the multi-faceted appeal of these online environments. Male players were significantly more likely to be driven by the Achievement and Manipulation factors, while female players were significantly more likely to be driven by the Relationship factor. Also, the data indicated that users derived meaningful relationships, salient emotional experiences as well as real-life leadership skills from these virtual environments. MMORPGs are not simply a pastime for teenagers, but a valuable research venue and platform where millions of users interact and collaborate using real-time 3D avatars on a daily basis.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7105-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7105_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 06:47:04">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D219554D38ADEE1FA88FB08733C22751?doi=10.1.1.315.7680&amp;rank=7</link><title>DARK ENERGY PERTURBATIONS AND A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THE COINCIDENCE PROBLEM</title><description>DARK ENERGY PERTURBATIONS AND A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THE COINCIDENCE PROBLEM

The pattern of disagreement between bond raters suggests that bank and insurance firms are inherently more opaque than other firms. Moody’s and S&amp;P split more frequently over these financial intermediaries and the splits are more lopsided, as theory here predicts. Uncertainty over the banks stems from their assets, loans and trading assets in particular, the risks of which are hard to observe or easy to change. Banks ’ high leverage, which invites agency problems, compounds the uncertainty over their assets. Our findings bear on both the existence and reform of bank regulation.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7105-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7105_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 06:50:43">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D219554D38ADEE1FA88FB08733C22751?doi=10.1.1.174.3580&amp;rank=10</link><title>Strength Is Ignorance; Slavery Is Freedom: Managing Culture in Modern Organizations</title><description>Strength Is Ignorance; Slavery Is Freedom: Managing Culture in Modern Organizations
