We analyze a large data set from Netflix, the leading online movie rental company, to shed new light on the causes and consequences of the Long Tail effect, which suggests that on the Internet, over time, consumers will increasingly shift away from hit products and toward niche products. We examine the aggregate level demand as well as demand at the individual consumer level and we find that the consumption of both the hit and the niche movies decreased over time when the popularity of the movies is ranked in absolute terms (e.g., the top/bottom 10 titles). However, we also observe that the active product variety has increased dramatically over the study period. To separate out the demand diversification effect from the shift in consumer preferences, we propose to measure the popularity of movies in relative terms by dynamically adjusting for the current product variety (e.g., the top/bottom 1 % of titles). Using this alternative definition of popularity, we find that the demand for the hits rises, while the demand for the niches still falls. We conclude that new movie titles appear much faster than consumers discover them. Finally, we find no evidence that niche titles satisfy consumer tastes better than hit titles and that a small number of heavy users are more likely to venture into niches than light users.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7408-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7408_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 19:20:15">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=93ABEEEBDA22D0AF3538E3EA9F264C8C?doi=10.1.1.124.1996&amp;rank=2</link><title>Reflections on notecards: Seven issues for the next generation of hypermedia systems</title><description>Reflections on notecards: Seven issues for the next generation of hypermedia systems

NoteCards is a general hypermedia environment designed to help people work with ideas. Its intended users are authors, designers, and other intellectual laborers engaged in analyzing information, designing artifacts, and generally processing ideas. The system provides these users with a variety of hypermedia-based tools for collecting, representing, managing, interrelating, and communicating ideas. This paper presents the NoteCards system as a foil against which to explore some of the major limitations of the current generation of hypermedia systems. In doing so, this paper highlights seven of the major issues that must be addressed in the next generation of hypermedia systems. These seven issues are: search and query, composite nodes, virtual structures, computational engines, versioning, collaborative work, and tailorability. For each of these issues, the papers describes the limitations inherent in NoteCards and the prospects for doing improving the situation in future systems.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7408-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7408_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 19:21:03">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=93ABEEEBDA22D0AF3538E3EA9F264C8C?doi=10.1.1.368.1064&amp;rank=3</link><title>CRUISE at the NTCIR-10 Mission Impossible Task</title><description>CRUISE at the NTCIR-10 Mission Impossible Task
