Online social networking sites like Orkut, YouTube, and Flickr are among the most popular sites on the Internet. Users of these sites form a social network, which provides a powerful means of sharing, organizing, and finding content and contacts. The popularity of these sites provides an opportunity to study the characteristics of online social network graphs at large scale. Understanding these graphs is important, both to improve current systems and to design new applications of online social networks. This paper presents a large-scale measurement study and analysis of the structure of multiple online social networks. We examine data gathered from four popular online social networks: Flickr, YouTube, LiveJournal, and Orkut. We crawled the publicly accessible user links on each site, obtaining a large portion of each social network’s graph. Our data set contains over 11.3 million users and 328 million links. We believe that this is the first study to examine multiple online social networks at scale. Our results confirm the power-law, small-world, and scalefree properties of online social networks. We observe that the indegree of user nodes tends to match the outdegree; that the networks contain a densely connected core of high-degree nodes; and that this core links small groups of strongly clustered, low-degree nodes at the fringes of the network. Finally, we discuss the implications of these structural properties for the design of social network based systems.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7078-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7078_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 02:09:30">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F1BDCD1381B69F3DBC60637088B4A6B?doi=10.1.1.69.5249&amp;rank=2</link><title>DBpedia: A Nucleus for a Web of Open Data</title><description>DBpedia: A Nucleus for a Web of Open Data

Abstract DBpedia is a community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and to make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against datasets derived from Wikipedia and to link other datasets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We describe the extraction of the DBpedia datasets, and how the resulting information is published on the Web for human- and machineconsumption. We describe some emerging applications from the DBpedia community and show how website authors can facilitate DBpedia content within their sites. Finally, we present the current status of interlinking DBpedia with other open datasets on the Web and outline how DBpedia could serve as a nucleus for an emerging Web of open data. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7078-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7078_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 02:10:42">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F1BDCD1381B69F3DBC60637088B4A6B?doi=10.1.1.14.3957&amp;rank=3</link><title>Nymble: High-Performance Learning Name-Finder</title><description>Nymble: High-Performance Learning Name-Finder

We present a syntax-based statistical translation model. Our model transforms a source-language parse tree into a target-language string by applying stochastic operations at each node. These operations capture linguistic differences such as word order and case marking. Model parameters are estimated in polynomial time using an EM algorithm. The model produces word alignments that are better than those produced by IBM Model 5. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7078-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7078_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 02:12:49">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F1BDCD1381B69F3DBC60637088B4A6B?doi=10.1.1.180.5642&amp;rank=5</link><title>From treebank to propbank</title><description>From treebank to propbank

This paper describes our approach to the development of a Proposition Bank, which involves the addition of semantic information to the Penn English Treebank. Our primary goal is the labeling of syntactic nodes with specific argument labels that preserve the similarity of roles such as the window in John broke the window and the window broke. After motivating the need for explicit predicate argument structure labels, we briefly discuss the theoretical considerations of predicate argument structure and the need to maintain consistency across syntactic alternations. The issues of consistency of argument structure across both polysemous and synonymous verbs are also discussed and we present our actual guidelines for these types of phenomena, along with numerous examples of tagged sentences and verb frames. Metaframes are introduced as a technique for handling similar frames among near− synonymous verbs. We conclude with a summary of the current status of annotation process. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7078-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7078_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 02:13:50">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F1BDCD1381B69F3DBC60637088B4A6B?doi=10.1.1.336.3082&amp;rank=6</link><title>Do foreign investors destabilize stock markets?

This paper examines the impact of foreign investors on stock returns in Korea from November 30, 1996 to the end of 1997 using order and trade data. We "nd strong evidence of positive feedback trading and herding by foreign investors before the period of Korea's economic crisis. During the crisis period, herding falls, and positive feedback trading by foreign investors mostly disappears. We "nd no evidence that trades by foreign investors had a destabilizing e!ect on Korea's stock market over our sample period. In particular, the market adjusted quickly and e$ciently to large sales by foreign investors, and these sales were not followed by negative abnormal returns. � 1999</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7078-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7078_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 02:14:47">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F1BDCD1381B69F3DBC60637088B4A6B?doi=10.1.1.150.4898&amp;rank=7</link><title>DBpedia -- A Crystallization Point for the Web of Data</title><description>DBpedia -- A Crystallization Point for the Web of Data

The DBpedia project is a community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and to make this information accessible on the Web. The resulting DBpedia knowledge base currently describes over 2.6 million entities. For each of these entities, DBpedia defines a globally unique identifier that can be dereferenced over the Web into a rich RDF description of the entity, including human-readable definitions in 30 languages, relationships to other resources, classifications in four concept hierarchies, various facts as well as data-level links to other Web data sources describing the entity. Over the last year, an increasing number of data publishers have begun to set data-level links to DBpedia resources, making DBpedia a central interlinking hub for the emerging Web of data. Currently, the Web of interlinked data sources around DBpedia provides approximately 4.7 billion pieces of information and covers domains such as geographic information, people, companies, films, music, genes, drugs, books, and scientific publications. This article describes the extraction of the DBpedia knowledge base, the current status of interlinking DBpedia with other data sources on the Web, and gives an overview of applications that facilitate the Web of Data around DBpedia.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7078-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7078_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 02:16:00">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F1BDCD1381B69F3DBC60637088B4A6B?doi=10.1.1.199.749&amp;rank=8</link><title>Integration of trade and disintegration of production in the global economy</title><description>Integration of trade and disintegration of production in the global economy

The last few decades have seen a spectacular integration of the global economy through trade. The rising integration of world markets has brought with it a disintegration of the production process, however, as manufacturing or services activities done abroad are combined with those performed at home. I compare several different measures of foreign outsourcing, and argue that they have all increased since the 1970s. I also consider the implications of globalization for employment and wages of low-skilled workers, and for trade and regulatory policy, such as labor standards. The last few decades have seen a spectacular integration of the global economy through trade. The share of imports (or exports) in GDP for the United States has approximately doubled in the last two decades, and if intra-OECD trade is omitted, the same is true for the OECD countries generally. Trade does remain a seemingly small fraction of U.S. GDP. This is not surprising in view of the fact that large economies trade less with others, and more internally. But the modest share of trade in total national income hides the fact that merchandise trade as a share of merchandise value-added is quite high for the U.S. and the OECD, and has been growing dramatically. In fact, if one focuses on merchandise trade relative to value-added, the world is much more integrated today than at any time during the past century.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7078-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7078_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 02:17:12">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F1BDCD1381B69F3DBC60637088B4A6B?doi=10.1.1.144.186&amp;rank=9</link><title>Compressed full-text indexes</title><description>Compressed full-text indexes

Full-text indexes provide fast substring search over large text collections. A serious problem of these indexes has traditionally been their space consumption. A recent trend is to develop indexes that exploit the compressibility of the text, so that their size is a function of the compressed text length. This concept has evolved into self-indexes, which in addition contain enough information to reproduce any text portion, so they replace the text. The exciting possibility of an index that takes space close to that of the compressed text, replaces it, and in addition provides fast search over it, has triggered a wealth of activity and produced surprising results in a very short time, and radically changed the status of this area in less than five years. The most successful indexes nowadays are able to obtain almost optimal space and search time simultaneously. In this paper we present the main concepts underlying self-indexes. We explain the relationship between text entropy and regularities that show up in index structures and permit compressing them. Then we cover the most relevant self-indexes up to date, focusing on the essential aspects on how they exploit the text compressibility and how they solve efficiently various search problems. We aim at giving the theoretical background to understand and follow the developments in this area.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7078-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7078_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 02:18:19">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F1BDCD1381B69F3DBC60637088B4A6B?doi=10.1.1.295.7310&amp;rank=10</link><title>Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf’s law</title><description>Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf’s law

When the probability of measuring a particular value of some quantity varies inversely as a power of that value, the quantity is said to follow a power law, also known variously as Zipf’s law or the Pareto distribution. Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, solar flares, moon craters, wars and people’s personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws. The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to explain them. I.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
