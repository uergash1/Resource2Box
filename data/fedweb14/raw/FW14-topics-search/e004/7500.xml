Abstract-This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to- a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge. This detection scheme uses several elongated operators at each point, and the directional operator outputs are integrated with the gradient maximum detector. Index Terms-Edge detection, feature extraction, image processing, machine vision, multiscale image analysis.

Wireless sensor networks promise fine-grain monitoring in a wide variety of environments. Many of these environments (e.g., indoor environments or habitats) can be harsh for wireless communication. From a networking perspective, the most basic aspect of wireless communication is the packet delivery performance:the spatio-temporal characteristics of packet loss, and its environmental dependence. These factors will deeply impact the performance of data acquisition from these networks. In this paper, we report on a systematic medium-scale (up to sixty nodes) measurement of packet delivery in three different environments:an indoor office building, a habitat with moderate foliage, and an open parking lot. Our findings have interesting implications for the design and evaluation of routing and medium-access protocols for sensor networks.

This paper proposes a new Bayesian framework for solving the matting problem, i.e. extracting a foreground element from a background image by estimating an opacity for each pixel of the foreground element. Our approach models both the foreground and background color distributions with spatiallyvarying sets of Gaussians, and assumes a fractional blending of the foreground and background colors to produce the final output. It then uses a maximum-likelihood criterion to estimate the optimal opacity, foreground and background simultaneously. In addition to providing a principled approach to the matting problem, our algorithm effectively handles objects with intricate boundaries, such as hair strands and fur, and provides an improvement over existing techniques for these difficult cases.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7500-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7500_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 02:36:32">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=852DADB498FCB0EAD3C9EF63C99C43A4?doi=10.1.1.410.1749&amp;rank=7</link><title>CLASSIFICATION OF ROOF MATERIALS FOR RAINWATER POLLUTION MODELIZATION</title><description>CLASSIFICATION OF ROOF MATERIALS FOR RAINWATER POLLUTION MODELIZATION
