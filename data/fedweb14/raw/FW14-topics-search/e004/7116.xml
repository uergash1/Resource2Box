We consider the problem of modeling annotated data—data with multiple types where the instance of one type (such as a caption) serves as a description of the other type (such as an image). We describe three hierarchical probabilistic mixture models that are aimed at such data, culminating in the Corr-LDA model, a latent variable model that is effective at modeling the joint distribution of both types and the conditional distribution of the annotation given the primary type. We take an empirical Bayes approach to finding parameter estimates and conduct experiments in held-out likelihood, automatic annotation, and text-based image retrieval using the Corel database of images and captions. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7116-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7116_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 08:29:40">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1784B0B57F129F4483652820C8606492?doi=10.1.1.171.262&amp;rank=2</link><title>Specialty Crop Profile: Pumpkins</title><description>Specialty Crop Profile: Pumpkins

The main purpose of most scholarly research, both theoretical and empirical, is to improve our understanding of the phenomena and processes being studied. The work may lead to useful prescriptions for policy, but that is usually the end-point of a long and winding path. Often, however, especially in matters of economic development and growth, the problems under investigation are large and urgent, so practitioners want immediate answers. Academic researchers are also tempted to offer suggestions for policy, however tentative or incomplete. Work on institutions and growth is a case in point. When I present my own theoretical models to audiences, I am almost invariably asked to interpret the results for their policy implications. The listeners usually find my responses meager and unsatisfactory, and I am compelled to agree. Today I want to take this opportunity to apply the same, admittedly very stringent, test of policy relevance to all academic research in this area. I will interpret all findings of this body of work as if they were prescriptions for policy or institutional reform, and question the validity and practicality of these interpretations.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7116-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7116_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 08:33:03">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1784B0B57F129F4483652820C8606492?doi=10.1.1.141.1205&amp;rank=5</link><title>Style Variation in Cooking Recipes</title><description>Style Variation in Cooking Recipes

Abstract. The evolution of digital libraries and the Internet has dramatically transformed the processing, storage, and retrieval of information. Efforts to digitize text, images, video, and audio now consume a substantial portion of both academic and industrial activity. Even when there is no shortage of textual materials on a particular topic, procedures for indexing or extracting the knowledge or conceptual information contained in them can be lacking. Recently developed information retrieval technologies are based on the concept of a vector space. Data are modeled as a matrix, and a user’s query of the database is represented as a vector. Relevant documents in the database are then identified via simple vector operations. Orthogonal factorizations of the matrix provide mechanisms for handling uncertainty in the database itself. The purpose of this paper is to show how such fundamental mathematical concepts from linear algebra can be used to manage and index large text collections. Key words. information retrieval, linear algebra, QR factorization, singular value decomposition, vector spaces</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7116-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7116_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 08:36:37">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1784B0B57F129F4483652820C8606492?doi=10.1.1.395.3181&amp;rank=8</link><title>How to Milk an Almond Stuff an Egg And Armor a Turnip A Thousand Years of Recipes</title><description>How to Milk an Almond Stuff an Egg And Armor a Turnip A Thousand Years of Recipes

Finding structures in vast multidimensional data sets, be they measurement data, statistics, or textual documents, is difficult and time-consuming. Interesting, novel relations between the data items may be hidden in the data. The selforganizing map (SOM) algorithm of Kohonen can be used to aid the exploration: the structures in the data sets can be illustrated on special map displays. In this work, the methodology of using SOMs for exploratory data analysis or data mining is reviewed and developed further. The properties of the maps are compared with the properties of related methods intended for visualizing highdimensional multivariate data sets. In a set of case studies the SOM algorithm is applied to analyzing electroencephalograms, to illustrating structures of the standard of living in the world, and to organizing full-text document collections. Measures are proposed for evaluating the quality of different types of maps in representing a given data set, and for measuring the robu...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
