Abstract: This paper outlines my concerns with Qualitative Data Analysis ’ (QDA) numerous remodelings of Grounded Theory (GT) and the subsequent eroding impact. I cite several examples of the erosion and summarize essential elements of classic GT methodology. It is hoped that the article will clarify my concerns with the continuing enthusiasm but misunderstood embrace of GT by QDA methodologists and serve as a preliminary guide to novice researchers who wish to explore the fundamental principles of GT.

Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a merger of two declarative paradigms: constraint solving and logic programming. Although a relatively new field, CLP has progressed in several quite different directions. In particular, the early fundamental concepts have been adapted to better serve in different areas of applications. In this survey of CLP, a primary goal is to give a systematic description of the major trends in terms of common fundamental concepts. The three main parts cover the theory, implementation issues, and programming for applications.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7421-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7421_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:38:45">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A2460B8395B5977C9835A94060FAD897?doi=10.1.1.112.8434&amp;rank=4</link><title>A tutorial on learning with Bayesian networks</title><description>A tutorial on learning with Bayesian networks

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

Opera is a significant part of, especially European, Cultural Heritage. It is also an area from which many feel excluded through lack of knowledge and understanding. OpenDrama is an EU funded project which sets out to deliver new ways of accessing opera and its archives. Opera involves a wide range of media, which interact in a number of ways. It is essentially time based, sequential. Historical archives hold structured data, metadata and media elements. Bringing these together to create an accessible whole with extensible software was the challenge. The OpenDrama system is designed to appeal to both the newcomer to opera and to the professional. It achieves this by having a number of different ways in which users can</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7421-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7421_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:39:38">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A2460B8395B5977C9835A94060FAD897?doi=10.1.1.23.9800&amp;rank=6</link><title>Searching The Web: The Public and Their Queries</title><description>Searching The Web: The Public and Their Queries

In studying actual Web searching by the public at large, we analyzed over one million Web queries by users of the Excite search engine. We found that most people use few search terms, few modified queries, view few Web pages, and rarely use advanced search features. A small number of search terms are used with high frequency, and a great many terms are unique; the language of Web queries is distinctive. Queries about recreation and entertainment rank highest. Findings are compared to data from two other large studies of Web queries. This study provides an insight into the public practices and choices in Web searching.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7421-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7421_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:40:05">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A2460B8395B5977C9835A94060FAD897?doi=10.1.1.21.815&amp;rank=7</link><title>The KidsRoom: Perceptually-Based Interactive and Immersive Story Environment</title><description>The KidsRoom: Perceptually-Based Interactive and Immersive Story Environment

The goal of this ongoing project is to develop an open agent architecture and accompanying user interface for networked desktop and handheld machines. The system we are building should support distributed execution of a user's requests, interoperabilityofmultiple application subsystems, addition of new agents, and incorporation of existing applications. It should also be transparent; users should not need to know where their requests are being executed, nor how. Finally, in order to facilitate the user's delegating tasks to agents, the architecture will be served byamultimodal interface, including pen, voice, and direct manipulation. Design considerations taken to support this functionality will be discussed below. INTRODUCTION Agents are all the rage. #Visioneering" videos, suchas Apple Computer's Knowledge Navigator, have helped to popularize the notion that programs endowed with agency, if not intelligence, are just around the corner.

LifeLines provide a general visualization environment for personal histories that can be applied to medical and court records, professional histories and other types of biographical data. A one screen overview shows multiple facets of the records. Aspects, for example medical conditions or legal cases, are displayed as individual time lines, while icons indicate discrete events, such as physician consultations or legal reviews. Line color and thickness illustrate relationships or significance, rescaling tools and filters allow users to focus on part of the information. LifeLines reduce the chances of missing information, facilitate spotting anomalies and trends, streamline access to details, while remaining tailorable and easily transferable between applications. The paper describes the use of LifeLines for youth records of the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice and also for medical records. User's feedback was collected using a Visual Basic prototype for the youth record.

A MUD (Multi-User Dungeon or, sometimes, Multi-User Dimension) is a network-accessible, multi-participant, user-extensible virtual reality whose user interface is entirely textual. Participants (usually called players) have the appearance of being situated in an artificially-constructed place that also contains those other players who are connected at the same time. Players can communicate easily with each other in real time. This virtual gathering place has many of the social attributes of other places, and many of the usual social mechanisms operate there. Certain attributes of this virtual place, however, tend to have significant effects on social phenomena, leading to new mechanisms and modes of behavior not usually seen ‘IRL’ (in real life). In this paper, I relate my experiences and observations from having created and maintained a MUD for over a year. 1 A Brief Introduction to Mudding The Machine did not transmit nuances</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
