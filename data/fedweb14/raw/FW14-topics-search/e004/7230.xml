In 2010, the Illinois State Board of Education maintained its sights on providing leadership, assistance, resources and advocacy so that every student is prepared with the knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes to succeed in careers and postsecondary education. The education system in Illinois continues to make strides toward excellence through the determination and efforts of educators, students, parents and communities, as well as the commitment of our elected officials. The General Assembly maintained the Foundation Level for General State Aid at $6,119, although the state’s economic woes led to many cuts to specific programs. The new year will bring more funding challenges for which no easy answers will be found. Members of the Illinois State Board of Education are committed to the goal of every student being able to demonstrate academic achievement and to be prepared for success after high school. The Board adopted new college and career ready standards for K-12 education in June 2010 to support the attainment of this goal. These benchmarks, known as the Common Core State Standards, aim to provide clear, consistent academic benchmarks with “fewer, clearer and higher ” standards for learning. Illinois has been a leader in developing the new standards and is also a governing member of the Partnership for the Assessment of Readiness for College and</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7230-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7230_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 19:27:46">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D38E5B0F4B43D1C7AF2109257315DBB0?doi=10.1.1.243.8003&amp;rank=4</link><title>The emergence of bluff in poker-like games</title><description>The emergence of bluff in poker-like games

The past decade has been Australia’s most ambitious period of water policy reform. All states and territories have now committed to the principles of the National Water Initiative. This commitment includes providing secure water for sustaining the environment. Withdrawing water for other uses changes our inland water ecosystems. Almost every inland ecological system in Australia is either permanently or seasonally limited by a shortage of water. Permanently withdrawing (abstracting) water from these systems will inevitably change their character in some way and degree. Conversely, this same water-limited ecology and our highly variable climate make these systems relatively resilient to</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7230-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7230_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 19:29:03">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D38E5B0F4B43D1C7AF2109257315DBB0?doi=10.1.1.214.3436&amp;rank=8</link><title>Point No Point Treaty Council</title><description>Point No Point Treaty Council

This report describes the results of an inventory of marine shoreline development throughout Hood Canal and the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. It also interprets the results on a large scale and for selected smaller areas. Shoreline features were field mapped by boat employing a Global Positioning System to mark positions. Information collected included shoreline features as points (e.g. docks, jetties, launch ramps, etc.) and as lines (bulkheads and backshore landforms) along the shoreline. Data summaries were generated by attaching point and line features to shoreline Geographic Information System layers and grouping these results by drift cells within sub-regions that were, in turn, grouped within larger regions. A total of 595 km of shoreline was mapped, extending from the Union River near Belfair in Lower Hood Canal to Dungeness Spit near Sequim in eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. Bulkheads were found to cover approximately 18 % of the total mapped shoreline.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7230-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7230_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 19:29:23">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D38E5B0F4B43D1C7AF2109257315DBB0?doi=10.1.1.41.8506&amp;rank=9</link><title>," Lake Bluff, Illinois, June 11, 1997</title><description>," Lake Bluff, Illinois, June 11, 1997

anking and finance. It is constructive to consider how and why views have changed since then. Capitalism is broad enough to encompass competing models, including 2 competing models of financial systems. The U.S. model -- shared with the U.K. and so sometimes called the Anglo-American model -- emphasizes arms-length market relationships. For example, it relies heavily on securities markets. To be sure, banks play an important role. But even bank loans tend to be made on arms-length terms. Certainly the government has little to say about where bank credit is allocated. The system that has developed in some Asian countries, on the other hand, has tended to follow more in the footsteps of the Japanese model. Without denying the important differences among these countries, the Asian systems traditionally seem to place greater reliance on bank loans than on securities markets, exhibit high debt/equity ratios, have closer relationships between banks and the companies that b</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7230-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7230_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 19:29:40">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D38E5B0F4B43D1C7AF2109257315DBB0?doi=10.1.1.423.1742&amp;rank=10</link><title>The Scarborough Community Council recommends that City Council adopt the staff</title><description>The Scarborough Community Council recommends that City Council adopt the staff
