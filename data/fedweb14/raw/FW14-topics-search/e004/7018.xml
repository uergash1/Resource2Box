In this paper, we present the W4F toolkit for the generation of wrappers for Web sources. W4F consists of a retrieval language to identify Web sources, a declarative extraction language (the HTML Extraction Language) to express robust extraction rules and a mapping interface to export the extracted information into some userde ned data-structures. To assist the user and make the creation of wrappers rapid and easy, the toolkit o ers some wysiwyg support via some wizards. Together, they permit the fast and semi-automatic generation of ready-to-go wrappers provided as Java classes. W4F has been successfully used to generate wrappers for database systems and software agents, making the content of Web sources easily accessible to any kind of application. Keywords: Web wrapper, information extraction, HTML parsing, HTML to XML conversion.

Our approach is based on a repetitive selection of best and worst candidates from sharpest or most credible initial and terminal kernels (see Bisdor# [6]). A practical illustration will concern the global ranking of movies from individual evaluations by a given set of movie critics.

Abstract \- Cited by 1 (0 self) \- Add to MetaCart

On the WWW it is not possible to supplement existing web pages of other people with new information or a link to that information, because the WWW does not have a standard method for write access. With write access, information can be added in the right context, which eases searching. We therefore define Open Information Pools: a collection of WWW based databases with public write access. By using databases we add structure to the information. Each database deals with a specific topic. We developed an architecture to support Open Information Pools. Important elements in the architecture are the rating and moderation tools. With these tools the user group is able to maintain and update the database and also to prevent errors and abuse. We conducted measurements on operational rating and moderation tools to show the validity of our idea. The study of Slashdot.org's rating and moderation tools shows that insightful information is recognised after only 37 minutes. We implemented a prototype...

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

Repurposive appropriation is a creative everyday act in which a user invents a novel use for information technology (IT) and adopts it. This study is the first to address its prevalence and predictability in the consumer IT context. 2,379 respondents filled in an online questionnaire on creative uses of digital cameras, such as using them as scanners, periscopes, and storage media. The data reveal that such creative uses are adopted by about half of the users, on average, across different demographic backgrounds. Discovery of a creative use on one’s own is slightly more common than is learning it from others. Most users discover the creative uses either completely on their own or wholly through learning from others. Our regression model explains 34 % of the variance in adoption of invented uses, with technology cognizance orientation, gender, exploration orientation, use frequency and use tenure as the strongest predictors. These findings have implications for both design and marketing.
