Morphology is the area of linguistics concerned with the internal structure of words. Information Retrieval has generally not paid much attention to word structure, other than to account for some of the variability in word forms via the use of stemmers. This paper will describe our experiments to determine the importance of morphology, and the effect that it has on performance. We will also describe the role of morphological analysis in word sense disambiguation, and in identifying lexical semantic relationships in a machine-readable dictionary. We will first provide a brief overview of morphological phenomena, and then describe the experiments themselves. 1 Introduction Morphology is the area of linguistics concerned with the internal structure of words. It is usually broken down into two subclasses: inflectional and derivational. Inflectional morphology describes predictable changes a word undergoes as a result of syntax - the plural and possessive form for nouns, and the past tens...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7222-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7222_02.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 19:00:16">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A45C3067930DF93DE68F3F6F165C7336?doi=10.1.1.47.4969&amp;rank=2</link><title>PathFinder: A Negotiation-Based Performance-Driven Router for FPGAs</title><description>PathFinder: A Negotiation-Based Performance-Driven Router for FPGAs

Read it as an adjunct to the lectures on distributed systems, links, and switching. It gives a fairly complete description of a working highly-available switched network providing daily service to about 100 hosts. The techniques used to obtain high reliability and fault-tolerance are characteristic of many distributed systems, not just of networks. The paper also makes clear the essential role of software in modern networks.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7222-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7222_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 19:00:56">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A45C3067930DF93DE68F3F6F165C7336?doi=10.1.1.21.6673&amp;rank=4</link><title>Effects of Wireless Physical Layer Modeling in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks</title><description>Effects of Wireless Physical Layer Modeling in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks

This paper presents a new appearance-based place recognition system for topological localization. The method uses a panoramic vision system to sense the environment. Color images are classified in real-time based on nearest-neighbor learning, image histogram matching, and a simple voting scheme. The system has been evaluated with eight cross-sequence tests in four unmodified environments, three indoors and one outdoors. In all eight cases, the system successfully tracked the mobile robot's position. The system correctly classified between 87% and 98% of the input color images. For the remaining images, the system was either momentarily confused or uncertain, but never classified an image incorrectly. 1. INTRODUCTION Localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics. Most mobile robots must be able to locate themselves in their environment in order to accomplish their tasks.

Media applications are characterized by large amounts of available parallelism, little data reuse, and a high computation to memory access ratio. While these characteristics are poorly matched to conventional microprocessor architectures, they are a good fit for modern VLSI technology with its high arithmetic capacity but limited global bandwidth. The stream programming model, in which an application is coded as streams of data records passing through computation kernels, exposes both parallelism and locality in media applications that can be exploited by VLSI architectures. The Imagine architecture supports the stream programming model by providing a bandwidth hierarchy tailored to the demands of media applications. Compared to a conventional scalar processor, Imagine reduces the global register and memory bandwidth required by typical applications by factors of 13 and 21 respectively. This bandwidth efficiency enables a single chip Imagine processor to achieve a peak performance of 1...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7222-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7222_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 19:02:16">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A45C3067930DF93DE68F3F6F165C7336?doi=10.1.1.150.273&amp;rank=8</link><title>Learning to Follow Navigational Route Instructions</title><description>Learning to Follow Navigational Route Instructions

Processors in portable electronic devices generally have a computational load which has time-varying performance requirements. Dynamic Voltage Scaling is a method to vary the processor’s supply voltage so that it consumes the minimal amount of energy by operating at the minimum performance level required by the active software processes. A dynamically varying supply voltage has implications on the processor circuit design and design flow, but with some minimal constraints it is straightforward to design a processor with this capability.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
