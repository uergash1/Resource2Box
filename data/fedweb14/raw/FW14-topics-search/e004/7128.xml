Inventories of manually compiled dictionaries usually serve as a source for word senses. However, they often include many rare senses while missing corpus/domain-specific senses. We present a clustering algorithm called CBC (Clustering By Committee) that automatically discovers word senses from text. It initially discovers a set of tight clusters called committees that are well scattered in the similarity space. The centroid of the members of a committee is used as the feature vector of the cluster. We proceed by assigning words to their most similar clusters. After assigning an element to a cluster, we remove their overlapping features from the element. This allows CBC to discover the less frequent senses of a word and to avoid discovering duplicate senses. Each cluster that a word belongs to represents one of its senses. We also present an evaluation methodology for automatically measuring the precision and recall of discovered senses.

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

In 1996, the Supply-Chain Council (SCC) developed the supply-chain operations reference (SCOR) model as the cross-industry standard for redefining and advancing supply chain management systems and practices. The SCOR model is a process reference model that integrates business process reengineering, benchmarking, and best practices. The SCOR model framework contains standard descriptions of management processes and metrics for performance. Scope of SCOR Processes The SCOR model breaks down supply chain processes into five categories: � Plan – The planning phase balances resources with business process requirements, manages the business rules, data collection, and general execution, and aligns the supply chain reconfiguration with financial goals. This phase sets the scale of the overall project. � Source – The sourcing phase handles deliveries and inbound logistics, identifies and selects supply sources, manages supplier and strategic supply relationships, and coordinates product receipts. The sourcing stage is the first discrete element</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7128-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7128_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:49:55">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=165F3234AF85956603C523B9326B22F5?doi=10.1.1.355.8089&amp;rank=7</link><title>for the New York City Uncontrolled Donation after Cardiac Death Study Group</title><description>for the New York City Uncontrolled Donation after Cardiac Death Study Group

endent processor, much like a second brain--or a portable assistant that is no longer carted about in a box. As it "sees" the world from our perspective, the system will learn from us, even when we are not consciously using it. Such computer assistance is not as far in the future as it might seem. Researchers were experimenting in related areas well before the late seventies, when I first became interested in wearable computing devices. Much of our progress is due to the computer industry's huge strides in miniaturization. My current wearable prototype, 1 equipped with head-mounted display, cameras, and wireless communications, enables computer-assisted forms of interaction in ordinary situations--for example, while walking, shopping, or meeting people--and it is hardly noticeable. DEVELOPING COMPUTERS TO WEAR In 1968 Ivan Sutherland described a head-mounted display with half-silvered mirrors that let the wearer see a virtual world superimposed on reality. 2, 3 His work, as well as s</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7128-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7128_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:50:27">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=165F3234AF85956603C523B9326B22F5?doi=10.1.1.221.6282&amp;rank=9</link><title>IRP Discussion Paper No. 1398-12 Estimating the Impact of Food Stamps on the New York City Poverty Rate Using a National Academy of Sciences-Style Poverty Measure</title><description>IRP Discussion Paper No. 1398-12 Estimating the Impact of Food Stamps on the New York City Poverty Rate Using a National Academy of Sciences-Style Poverty Measure
