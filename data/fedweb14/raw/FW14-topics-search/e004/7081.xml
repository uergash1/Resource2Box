An intelligent thesaurus assists a writer with alternative choices of words and orders them by their suitability in the writing context. In this paper we focus on methods for automatically choosing near-synonyms by their semantic coherence with the context. Our statistical method uses the Web as a corpus to compute mutual information scores. Evaluation experiments show that this method performs better than a previous method on the same task. We also propose and evaluate two more methods, one that uses anti-collocations, and one that uses supervised learning. To asses the difficulty of the task, we present results obtained by human judges. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7081-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7081_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 02:49:55">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=FC0E15CC97F9808CF56134CBB514971A?doi=10.1.1.207.5328&amp;rank=9</link><title>How Many Multiword Expressions do People Know?</title><description>How Many Multiword Expressions do People Know?

What is a multiword expression (MWE) and how many are there? What is a MWE? What is many? Mark Liberman gave a great invited talk at ACL-89 titled “how many words do people know? ” where he spent the entire hour questioning the question. Many of these same questions apply to multiword expressions. What is a word? What is many? What is a person? What does it mean to know? Rather than answer these questions, this paper will use these questions as Liberman did, as an excuse for surveying how such issues are addressed in a variety of fields: computer science, web search, linguistics, lexicography, educational testing, psychology, statistics, etc. 1 How many words do people know? One can find all sorts of answers on the web: • Very low: Apparently I only knew 7,000 words when I was seven and 14,000 when I was fourteen. I learned from exposure. Now things are not that easy in a second language, but it just shows that the brain can absorb information from sheer input. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7081-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7081_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 02:50:54">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=FC0E15CC97F9808CF56134CBB514971A?doi=10.1.1.112.9703&amp;rank=10</link><title>Good Modelling Practice in water management</title><description>Good Modelling Practice in water management

ABSTRACT: Despite its ever increasing capability to solve complex problems, empowered by exponential growing computer potentials, modelling and simulation is a frequently used, but illdefined methodology. This ends in irreproducible model based studies of unknown quality. To assess these shortcomings a Good Modelling Practice handbook for water management has been developed, in which the modelling and simulation process is defined in detail and modellers are made familiar with model sensitivities and the pitfalls in which other modellers are trapped. This handbook has been achieved by negotiation with representatives of all stakeholders involved. 1</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
