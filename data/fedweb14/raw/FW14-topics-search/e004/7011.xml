Summary. This paper presents research on the concentration of microcystins produced by Microcystis aeruginosa (Kützing, UTEX 2667). The relationship between the production of microcystins, the algae growth and the content of chlorophyll a was investigated at five temperatures (range 20-38°C) and two light intensities – 8000 lx and 2x8000 lx. ELISA method was used for measuring the toxin level. Optimal conditions for the production of microcystins at 25-26°C were observed. Neither of the two light intensities impacted the amount of microcystins. HPLC-DAD quality analysis for determination of microcystins in the algal biomass was performed. The results showed presence of microcystin-LR and six unknown peaks possessing characteristic microcystin-like UV-spectra, which are of interest for future investigations.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7011-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7011_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 00:04:31">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=9ECD9F312738F58AE670E8782684E1A4?doi=10.1.1.387.680&amp;rank=2</link><title>First edition</title><description>First edition

Background: We identified two 3p21.3 regions (LUCA and AP20) as most frequently affected in lung, breast and other carcinomas and reported their fine physical and gene maps. It is becoming increasingly clear that each of these two regions contains several TSGs. Until now TSGs which were isolated from AP20 and LUCA regions (e.g.G21/NPRL2, RASSF1A, RASSF1C, SEMA3B, SEMA3F, RBSP3) were shown to inhibit tumour cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings: The effect of expression HYAL1 and HYAL2 was studied by colony formation inhibition, growth curve and cell proliferation tests in vitro and tumour growth assay in vivo. Very modest growth inhibition was detected in vitro in U2020 lung and KRC/Y renal carcinoma cell lines. In the in vivo experiment stably transfected KRC/Y cells expressing HYAL1 or HYAL2 were inoculated into SCID mice (10 and 12 mice respectively). Tumours grew in eight mice inoculated with HYAL1. Ectopic HYAL1 was deleted in all of them. HYAL2 was inoculated into 12 mice and only four tumours were obtained. In 3 of them the gene was deleted. In one tumour it was present but not expressed. As expected for tumour suppressor genes HYAL1 and HYAL2 were down-expressed in 15 fresh lung squamous cell carcinomas (100%) and clear cell RCC tumours (60–67%). Conclusions/Significance: The results suggest that the expression of either gene has led to inhibition of tumour growth in</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7011-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7011_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 00:12:34">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=9ECD9F312738F58AE670E8782684E1A4?doi=10.1.1.382.5585&amp;rank=7</link><title>www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms NotI Microarrays: Novel Epigenetic Markers for Early Detection and Prognosis of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer</title><description>www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms NotI Microarrays: Novel Epigenetic Markers for Early Detection and Prognosis of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer

We examined sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and micronuclei (MN; cytokinesis-block method) in cultured peripheral lymphocytes from 52 female workers of two shoe factories and from 36 unexposed age- and sex-matched referents. The factory workers showed an elevated level of urinary hippuric acid, a biomarker of toluene exposure, and workplace air contained high concentrations of various organic solvents such as toluene, gasoline, acetone, and (in one of the plants only) ethylacetate and methylenediphenyl diisocyanate. The shoe factory workers showed a statistically significant higher frequency of micronucleated binucleate lymphocytes in comparison with the referents. This finding agreed with three preliminary MN determinations (each comprising 27–32 shoe workers and 16–20 controls) performed in one of the plants 2–5 years earlier. The shoe factory workers also had a lower average level of blood hemoglobin than the referents. In contrast, no difference was found between the groups in SCE analysis. Smokers showed significantly higher mean frequencies of SCEs per cell and high frequency cells (HFC) than nonsmokers. Aging was associated with increased MN rates and reduced cell proliferation. Polymorphism of the glutathione S-transferase M1 gene (GSTM1) did not affect the individual level of SCEs; but in smoking shoe workers an effect of the occupational exposure on the frequency of micronucleated</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7011-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7011_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 00:19:32">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=9ECD9F312738F58AE670E8782684E1A4?doi=10.1.1.280.8306&amp;rank=9</link><title>National Centre of Radiobiology and Radiation Protection, Sofia, Bulgaria;</title><description>National Centre of Radiobiology and Radiation Protection, Sofia, Bulgaria;

To investigate whether occupational exposure to lead is genotoxic, we evaluated data from 103 lead-exposed workers and 78 matched controls. These data correspond to three different sampling periods, and we measured genetic damage as increases in the frequency of binucleated cells with micronuclei (BNMN) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The levels of exposure were determined according to the lead levels in blood. Clearly significant increases in BNMN were observed in the exposed groups when compared to the control group. In addition, for the overall population (n = 181), we observed a clear relationship between lead levels in blood and BNMN (r = 0.497; p &lt; 0.001). When we examined four exposure levels—very low exposure (&lt; 1.20 µM/L), low exposure (1.20–1.91 µM/L), high exposure (1.92–2.88 µM/L), and very high exposure (&gt; 2.88 µM/L)—we found significant differences in the genetic damage induction. We conclude that exposure to levels of lead higher than 1.20 µM/L may pose an increase in genetic risk. In addition, our data show that blood lead level is a good indicator of genetic damage induction. Key words: biomonitoring, genotoxicity, lead-exposed workers, lymphocytes, micronucleus assay.
