The purpose of this paper is to build the foundation for software architecture. We first develop an intuition for software architecture by appealing to several well-established architectural disciplines. On the basis of this intuition, we present a model of software architec-ture that consists of three components: elements, form, and rationale. Elements are either processing, data, or connecting elements. Form is defined in terms of the properties of, and the relationships among, the elements-- that is, the constraints on the elements. The ratio-nale provides the underlying basis for the architecture in terms of the system constraints, which most often derive from the system:requirements. We discuss the compo-nents of the model in the context of both architectures and architectural styles and present an extended exam-ple to illustrate some important architecture and style considerations. We conclude by presenting some of the benefits of our approach to software architecture, sum-marizing our contributions, and relating our approach to other current work.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7095-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7095_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:47:13">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A18901E3A1E7D53849BA5843A8547B5E?doi=10.1.1.321.346&amp;rank=2</link><title>Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness</title><description>Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness

How behavior and institutions are affected by social relations is one of the classic questions of social theory. This paper concerns the extent to which economic action is embedded in structures of social relations, in modern industrial society. Although the usual neoclassical accounts provide an "undersocialized " or atomized-actor explanation of such action, reformist economists who attempt to bring social structure back in do so in the "oversocialized " way criticized by Dennis Wrong. Under- and oversocialized accounts are paradoxically similar in their neglect of ongoing structures of social relations, and a sophisticated account of economic action must consider its embeddedness in such structures. The argument is illustrated by a critique of Oliver Williamson's "markets and hierarchies " research program.

Large-scale peer-to-peer systems face security threats from faulty or hostile remote computing elements. To resist these threats, many such systems employ redundancy. However, if a single faulty entity can present multiple identities, it can control a substantial fraction of the system, thereby undermining this redundancy. One approach to preventing these "Sybil attacks" is to have a trusted agency certify identities. This paper shows that, without a logically centralized authority, Sybil attacks are always possible except under extreme and unrealistic assumptions of resource parity and coordination among entities.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7095-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7095_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:53:00">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A18901E3A1E7D53849BA5843A8547B5E?doi=10.1.1.139.3990&amp;rank=7</link><title>Plenoptic Modeling: An Image-Based Rendering System</title><description>Plenoptic Modeling: An Image-Based Rendering System

Image-based rendering is a powerful new approach for generating real-time photorealistic computer graphics. It can provide convincing animations without an explicit geometric representation. We use the “plenoptic function” of Adelson and Bergen to provide a concise problem statement for image-based rendering paradigms, such as morphing and view interpolation. The plenoptic function is a parameterized function for describing everything that is visible from a given point in space. We present an image-based rendering system based on sampling, reconstructing, and resampling the plenoptic function. In addition, we introduce a novel visible surface algorithm and a geometric invariant for cylindrical projections that is equivalent to the epipolar constraint defined for planar projections.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7095-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7095_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:53:57">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A18901E3A1E7D53849BA5843A8547B5E?doi=10.1.1.221.2247&amp;rank=8</link><title>Wireless sensor networks: a survey</title><description>Wireless sensor networks: a survey

This paper describes the concept of sensor networks which has been made viable by the convergence of microelectro-mechanical systems technology, wireless communications and digital electronics. First, the sensing tasks and the potential sensor networks applications are explored, and a review of factors influencing the design of sensor networks is provided. Then, the communication architecture for sensor networks is outlined, and the algorithms and protocols developed for each layer in the literature are explored. Open research issues for the realization of sensor networks are</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7095-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7095_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:55:03">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A18901E3A1E7D53849BA5843A8547B5E?doi=10.1.1.13.9919&amp;rank=9</link><title>Class-Based n-gram Models of Natural Language</title><description>Class-Based n-gram Models of Natural Language

We address the problem of predicting a word from previous words in a sample of text. In particular we discuss n-gram models based on calsses of words. We also discuss several statistical algoirthms for assigning words to classes based on the frequency of their co-occurrence with other words. We find that we are able to extract classes that have the flavor of either syntactically based groupings or semantically based groupings, depending on the nature of the underlying statistics.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7095-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7095_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:56:16">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=A18901E3A1E7D53849BA5843A8547B5E?doi=10.1.1.334.7154&amp;rank=10</link><title>Corporate Financing and Investment Decisions when Firms Have Information that Investors Do Not Have</title><description>Corporate Financing and Investment Decisions when Firms Have Information that Investors Do Not Have

This paper considers a firm that must issue common stock to raise cash to undertake a valuable investment opportunity. Management is assumed to know more about the firm’s value than potential investors. Investors interpret the firm’s actions rationally. An. equilibrium mode1 of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The mode1 shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required. Extensions and applications of the model are discussed. 1.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
