Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

A study of the literature on permeability and water transfer through cells mad tissues reveals an apparent paucity of quantitative data on water transfer in relation to ageing, yet water is one of the most important components of cells at all ages. Goldforb (5) observed that unfertilized eggs of Arbada punctulata aged in sea water manifested a progressive and marked increase in permeability to water. He (6) found also that the increasing permeability to water is associated with increasing viscosity during early and intermediate changes; during the later stages with excess water intake, viscosity is reversed. In studies on bread mold, pollen tubes, eggs, and protozoa, Seifriz (15) observed that young active protoplasm increases its viscosity as it matures and becomes less active. He maintained that the progressive increase in consistency of protoplasm is coincident with a decrease in physiological activity. Does the protoplasm become more viscous because with ageing there is less water influx through unit surface area, or because water loss from the cell is greater than water gain, or is there comparatively more bound water from</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7259-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7259_02.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 20:48:26">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=6E66C6B8EDD0E5F1117A244A67928AA6?doi=10.1.1.281.9582&amp;rank=2</link><title>POLYRIBOSOMES ACCUMULATIONS AND CISTERNAL IN ROOT CELLS OF RADISH</title><description>POLYRIBOSOMES ACCUMULATIONS AND CISTERNAL IN ROOT CELLS OF RADISH
