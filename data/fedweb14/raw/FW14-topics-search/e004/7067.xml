Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

“This is the one book you need to teach creation. When people hear the earth is billions of years old... what do you say? Guide to Creation Basics has the answers!” Guide to Creation Basics is a comprehensive 120-page guide—authored by ICR scientists and scholars—loaded with hundreds of full-color illustrations. • Build your child’s confidence in biblical creation! • Cutting-edge scientific information and full-color illustrations • Homeschoolers have trusted ICR resources for over 40 years “ICR’s Guide to Creation Basics is elegantly produced and powerfully presented. The favorite dogmas of evolutionary theory are boldly examined and dismantled with clear logic and simple facts—starting with the obvious truth that God’s handiwork is clearly visible everywhere. Whether we look through a telescope, a microscope, or with our own unaided eyes, what we see is a universe filled with the incontrovertible evidence of God’s ingenious design, His magnificent glory, and His vast power. This book sets forth a generous sampling of that evidence, making a vivid and compelling case for the biblical account of creation. This is an invaluable resource for students, teachers, or anyone confused by authoritative-sounding skeptics.”</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7067-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7067_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 00:39:26">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=F251417C8E989FA03B80C155C0EC2441?doi=10.1.1.325.1554&amp;rank=2</link><title>Irreversibility of kindled alcohol-withdrawal behaviour in rats</title><description>Irreversibility of kindled alcohol-withdrawal behaviour in rats
