Reliable transport protocols such as TCP are tuned to perform well in traditional networks where packet losses occur mostly because of congestion. However, networks with wireless and other lossy links also suffer from significant losses due to bit errors and handoffs. TCP responds to all losses by invoking congestion control and avoidance algorithms, resulting in degraded end-to-end performance in wireless and lossy systems. In this paper, we compare several schemes designed to improve the performance of TCP in such networks. We classify these schemes into three broad categories: end-to-end protocols, where loss recovery is performed by the sender; link-layer protocols, that provide local reliability; and split-connection protocols, that break the end-to-end connection into two parts at the base station. We present the results of several experiments performed in both LAN and WAN environments, using throughput and goodput as the metrics for comparison. Our results show that a reliable link-layer protocol that is TCP-aware provides very good performance. Furthermore, it is possible to achieve good performance without splitting the end-to-end connection at the base station. We also demonstrate that selective acknowledgments and explicit loss notifications result in significant performance improvements.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7469-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7469_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 14:52:20">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=826DB9AAF0DFCE501821EE7365D5A04D?doi=10.1.1.123.7607&amp;rank=2</link><title>Optimization by simulated annealing</title><description>Optimization by simulated annealing

We show that every language in NP has a probablistic verifier that checks membership proofs for it using logarithmic number of random bits and by examining a constant number of bits in the proof. If a string is in the language, then there exists a proof such that the verifier accepts with probability 1 (i.e., for every choice of its random string). For strings not in the language, the verifier rejects every provided “proof " with probability at least 1/2. Our result builds upon and improves a recent result of Arora and Safra [6] whose verifiers examine a nonconstant number of bits in the proof (though this number is a very slowly growing function of the input length). As a consequence we prove that no MAX SNP-hard problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme, unless NP=P. The class MAX SNP was defined by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [82] and hard problems for this class include vertex cover, maximum satisfiability, maximum cut, metric TSP, Steiner trees and shortest superstring. We also improve upon the clique hardness results of Feige, Goldwasser, Lovász, Safra and Szegedy [42], and Arora and Safra [6] and shows that there exists a positive ɛ such that approximating the maximum clique size in an N-vertex graph to within a factor of N ɛ is NP-hard. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7469-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7469_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 14:56:26">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=826DB9AAF0DFCE501821EE7365D5A04D?doi=10.1.1.29.738&amp;rank=4</link><title>Investigating the Energy Consumption of a Wireless Network Interface in an Ad Hoc Networking Environment</title><description>Investigating the Energy Consumption of a Wireless Network Interface in an Ad Hoc Networking Environment

Energy-aware design and evaluation of network protocols requires knowledge of the energy consumption behavior of actual wireless interfaces. But little practical information is available about the energy consumption behavior of well-known wireless network interfaces and device specifications do not provide information in a form that is helpful to protocol developers. This paper describes a series of experiments which obtained detailed measurements of the energy consumption of an IEEE 802.11 wireless network interface operating in an ad hoc networking environment. The data is presented as a collection of linear equations for calculating the energy consumed in sending, receiving and discarding broadcast and pointto -point data packets of various sizes. Some implications for protocol design and evaluation in ad hoc networks are discussed. Keywords---energy consumption, IEEE 802.11, ad hoc networks I.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7469-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7469_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 15:00:45">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=826DB9AAF0DFCE501821EE7365D5A04D?doi=10.1.1.145.8046&amp;rank=5</link><title>Improving TCP/IP performance over wireless networks</title><description>Improving TCP/IP performance over wireless networks

Rapide is an event-based concurrent, object-oriented language specifically designed for prototyping system architectures. Two principle design goals are (1) to provide constructs for defining executable prototypes of architectures, and (2) to adopt an execution model in which the concurrency, synchronization, dataflow, and timing properties of a prototype are explicitly represented. This paper describes the partially ordered event set (poset) execution model and outlines with examples some of the event-based features for defining communication architectures and relationships between architectures. Various features of Rapide are illustrated by excerpts from a prototype of the X/Open distributed transaction processing reference architecture.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7469-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7469_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 15:04:30">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=826DB9AAF0DFCE501821EE7365D5A04D?doi=10.1.1.118.5976&amp;rank=7</link><title>Modeling the effect of technology trends on the soft error rate of combinational logic</title><description>Modeling the effect of technology trends on the soft error rate of combinational logic

In this paper, we demonstrate that a collaborative relationship between the operating system and applications can be used to meet user-specified goals for battery duration. We first show how applications can dynamically modify their behavior to conserve energy. We then show how the Linux operating system can guide such adaptation to yield a batterylife of desired duration. By monitoring energy supply and demand, it is able to select the correct tradeoff between energy conservation and application quality. Our evaluation shows that this approach can meet goals that extend battery life by as much as 30%.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7469-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7469_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 15:08:02">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=826DB9AAF0DFCE501821EE7365D5A04D?doi=10.1.1.119.6793&amp;rank=9</link><title>The HP AutoRAID hierarchical storage system</title><description>The HP AutoRAID hierarchical storage system
