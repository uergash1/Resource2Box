I actually own a copy of Harold Jeffreys’s Theory of Probability but have only read small bits of it, most recently over a decade ago to confirm that, indeed, Jeffreys was not too proud to use a classical chi-squared p-value when he wanted to check the misfit of a model to data (Gelman, Meng and Stern, 2006). I do, however, feel that it is important to understand where our probability models come from, and I welcome the opportunity to use the present article by Robert, Chopin and Rousseau as a platform for further discussion of foundational issues. 2 In this brief discussion I will argue the following: (1) in thinking about prior distributions, we should go beyond Jeffreys’s principles and move toward weakly informative priors; (2) it is natural for those of us who work in social and computational sciences to favor complex models, contra Jeffreys’s preference for simplicity; and (3) a key generalization of Jeffreys’s ideas is to explicitly include model checking in the process of data analysis.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7307-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7307_02.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:48:49">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=4BDB153A80218453D38A4396834739A3?doi=10.1.1.206.1458&amp;rank=2</link><title>Metaphors We Live By</title><description>Metaphors We Live By

1\. Make a list of some of the metaphors discussed by Lakoff and Johnson. Try inserting new words that convey a different meaning. For example, consider the expression, “I’d like to share some time with you ” rather than “spend some time with you.” 2. Make a list of “language asymmetries ” (see Part II, p. XX, and Reading 12 for definitions) and consider what underlying cultural values these asymmetries indicate. 3. Consider the use of the masculine he or man to refer to all people. Some people say that this “generic use ” is perfectly acceptable because the terms “imply ” women as well as men. Others argue that the term not only leaves out half the population but also perpetuates an image of women as “auxiliary”and men as “central.”Discuss this. 4. Discuss the cultural practice of women taking men’s names when they marry. What cultural values does this practice convey? 5. Keep track of all the “medicalized ” terms you hear for a few days (for example, erectile dysfunction, hyperkinesis). Try substituting more common terms and see if you think about the “problem ” differently. For example, clinically depressed versus tired and really burnt out. Do these problems seem more real or authentic with the use of some terms rather than others?</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7307-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7307_03.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:49:09">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=4BDB153A80218453D38A4396834739A3?doi=10.1.1.10.4919&amp;rank=3</link><title>Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and Retrieval System</title><description>Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and Retrieval System

We describe Freenet, an adaptive peer-to-peer network application that permits the publication, replication, and retrieval of data while protecting the anonymity of both authors and readers. Freenet operates as a network of identical nodes that collectively pool their storage space to store data files and cooperate to route requests to the most likely physical location of data. No broadcast search or centralized location index is employed. Files are referred to in a location-independent manner, and are dynamically replicated in locations near requestors and deleted from locations where there is no interest. It is infeasible to discover the true origin or destination of a file passing through the network, and difficult for a node operator to determine or be held responsible for the actual physical contents of her own node.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7307-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7307_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:49:30">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=4BDB153A80218453D38A4396834739A3?doi=10.1.1.118.2962&amp;rank=4</link><title>Cache memories</title><description>Cache memories

Cache memories are used in modern, medium and high-speed CPUs to hold temporarily those portions of the contents of main memory which are {believed to be) currently in use.

A mobile ad hoc network is a relatively new term for an old technology - a network that does not rely on pre-existing infrastructure. Roots of this technology could be traced back to the early 1970s with the DARPA PRNet and the SURAN projects. The new twitch is the application of this technology in the non-military communication environments. Additionally, the research community has also recently addressed some extended features of this technology, such as multicasting and security. Also numerous new solutions to the "old" problems of routing and medium access control have been proposed. This survey attempts to summarize the state-ofthe -art of the ad hoc networking technology in four areas: routing, medium access control, multicasting, and security. Where possible, comparison between the proposed protocols is also discussed.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7307-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7307_06.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:50:05">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=4BDB153A80218453D38A4396834739A3?doi=10.1.1.14.2230&amp;rank=6</link><title>Interpretation as Abduction</title><description>Interpretation as Abduction

An approach to abductive inference developed in the TACITUS project has resulted in a dramatic simplification of how the problem of interpreting texts is conceptualized. Its use in solving the local pragmatics problems of reference, compound nominals, syntactic ambiguity, and metonymy is described and illustrated. It also suggests an elegant and thorough integration of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7307-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7307_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:50:19">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=4BDB153A80218453D38A4396834739A3?doi=10.1.1.295.4275&amp;rank=7</link><title>Increasing Returns and Long-Run Growth</title><description>Increasing Returns and Long-Run Growth

Distributed Sensor Networks (DSNs) are ad-hoc mobile networks that include sensor nodes with limited computation and communication capabilities. DSNs are dynamic in the sense that they allow addition and deletion of sensor nodes after deployment to grow the network or replace failing and unreliable nodes. DSNs may be deployed in hostile areas where communication is monitored and nodes are subject to capture and surreptitious use by an adversary. Hence DSNs require cryptographic protection of communications, sensorcapture detection, key revocation and sensor disabling. In this paper, we present a key-management scheme designed to satisfy both operational and security requirements of DSNs.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7307-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7307_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:50:53">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=4BDB153A80218453D38A4396834739A3?doi=10.1.1.18.4669&amp;rank=9</link><title>Intelligence without reason</title><description>Intelligence without reason

Computers and Thought are the two categories that together define Artificial Intelligence as a discipline. It is generally accepted that work in Artificial Intelligence over the last thirty years has had a strong influence on aspects of computer architectures. In this paper we also make the converse claim; that the state of computer architecture has been a strong influence on our models of thought. The Von Neumann model of computation has lead Artificial Intelligence in particular directions. Intelligence in biological systems is completely different. Recent work in behavior-based Artificial Intelligence has produced new models of intelligence that are much closer in spirit to biological systems. The non-Von Neumann computational models they use share many characteristics with biological computation.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7307-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7307_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:51:20">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=4BDB153A80218453D38A4396834739A3?doi=10.1.1.393.8917&amp;rank=10</link><title>Being There -- Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again</title><description>Being There -- Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again
