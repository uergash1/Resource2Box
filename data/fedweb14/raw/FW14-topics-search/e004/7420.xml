Twitter, a popular microblogging service, has received much attention recently. An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes, in Twitter, and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. The particle filter works better than other compared methods in estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake by monitoring tweets with high probability (96 % of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected). Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users. Notification is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the JMA. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7420-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7420_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:35:08">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1D266BE3AF66E87CDB18BF41B3F1CF03?doi=10.1.1.207.2920&amp;rank=5</link><title>TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT MÜNCHEN An Interactive Fluid Dynamics Game on</title><description>TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT MÜNCHEN An Interactive Fluid Dynamics Game on

We present the design, implementation, evaluation, and user experiences of the CenceMe application, which represents the first system that combines the inference of the presence of individuals using off-the-shelf, sensor-enabled mobile phones with sharing of this information through social networking applications such as Facebook and MySpace. We discuss the system challenges for the development of software on the Nokia N95 mobile phone. We present the design and tradeoffs of split-level classification, whereby personal sensing presence (e.g., walking, in conversation, at the gym) is derived from classifiers which execute in part on the phones and in part on the backend servers to achieve scalable inference. We report performance measurements that characterize the computational requirements of the software and the energy consumption of the CenceMe phone client. We validate the system through a user study where twenty two people, including undergraduates, graduates and faculty, used CenceMe continuously over a three week period in a campus town. From this user study we learn how the system performs in a production environment and what uses people find for a personal sensing system.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7420-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7420_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:37:09">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1D266BE3AF66E87CDB18BF41B3F1CF03?doi=10.1.1.184.1125&amp;rank=10</link><title>High frequency Verlet integration physics on iPhone</title><description>High frequency Verlet integration physics on iPhone
