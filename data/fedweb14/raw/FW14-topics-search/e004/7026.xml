The aggregate motion of a flock of birds, a herd of land animals, or a school of fish is a beautiful and familiar part of the natural world. But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator. " The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7026-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7026_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 17:44:29">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=8B406C240EC5242B44F121F89153BF94?doi=10.1.1.19.1992&amp;rank=2</link><title>Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down?

This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down). The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., "subtle nuances") and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., "very cavalier"). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word "excellent" minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word "poor". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7026-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7026_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 17:45:41">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=8B406C240EC5242B44F121F89153BF94?doi=10.1.1.108.3622&amp;rank=3</link><title>Particle Systems - A Technique for Modeling a Class of Fuzzy Objects</title><description>Particle Systems - A Technique for Modeling a Class of Fuzzy Objects

Virtual reality (VR) is typically defined in terms of technological hardware. This paper attempts to cast a new, variable-based definition of virtual reality that can be used to classify virtual reality in relation to other media. The defintion of virtual reality is based on concepts of "presence" and "telepresence," which refer to the sense of being in an environment, generated by natural or mediated means, respectively. Two technological dimensions that contribute to telepresence, vividness and interactivity, are discussed. A variety of media are classified according to these dimensions. Suggestions are made for the application of the new definition of virtual reality within the field of communication research.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7026-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7026_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 17:48:00">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=8B406C240EC5242B44F121F89153BF94?doi=10.1.1.19.6229&amp;rank=5</link><title>Animation and Rendering of Complex Water Surfaces</title><description>Animation and Rendering of Complex Water Surfaces

We present a new method for the animation and rendering of photorealistic water effects. Our method is designed to produce visually plausible three dimensional effects, for example the pouring of water into a glass (see figure 1) and the breaking of an ocean wave, in a manner which can be used in a computer animation environment. In order to better obtain photorealism in the behavior of the simulated water surface, we introduce a new "thickened" front tracking technique to accurately represent the water surface and a new velocity extrapolation method to move the surface in a smooth, water-like manner. The velocity extrapolation method allows us to provide a degree of control to the surface motion, e.g. to generate a windblown look or to force the water to settle quickly. To ensure that the photorealism of the simulation carries over to the final images, we have integrated our method with an advanced physically based rendering system.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7026-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7026_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 17:49:04">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=8B406C240EC5242B44F121F89153BF94?doi=10.1.1.153.9267&amp;rank=6</link><title>Toward Machine Emotional Intelligence: Analysis of Affective Physiological State</title><description>Toward Machine Emotional Intelligence: Analysis of Affective Physiological State

Statistical literacy is a key ability expected of citizens in information-laden societies, and is often touted as an expected outcome of schooling and as a necessary component of adults' numeracy and literacy. Yet, its meaning and building blocks have received little explicit attention. This paper proposes a conceptualization of statistical literacy and describes its key components. Statistical literacy is portrayed as the ability to interpret, critically evaluate, and communicate about statistical information and messages. It is argued that statistically literate behavior is predicated on the joint activation of five interrelated knowledge bases (literacy, statistical, mathematical, context, and critical), together with a cluster of supporting dispositions and enabling beliefs. Educational and research implications are discussed, and responsibilities facing educators, statisticians, and other stakeholders are outlined.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7026-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7026_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 17:50:30">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=8B406C240EC5242B44F121F89153BF94?doi=10.1.1.202.3313&amp;rank=8</link><title>What Empty Names Are</title><description>What Empty Names Are

There are basically four problems to solve in order to produce realistic animated synthetic actors with hair: hair modeling and creation, hair motion, collision detection and hair rendering. This paper describes a complete methodology to solve these basic four problems. We present how hair styles may be designed with our HairStyler module. Then we survey the animation model and emphasize a method of collision processing. Finally, we explain how hair may be rendered using an extension of a standard ray-tracing program. We also show applications of our synthetic actors with various hair styles and different styles of mustaches and beards.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7026-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7026_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 17:52:18">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=8B406C240EC5242B44F121F89153BF94?doi=10.1.1.84.6318&amp;rank=10</link><title>Achieving affective impact: Visual emotive communication in lifelike pedagogical agents</title><description>Achieving affective impact: Visual emotive communication in lifelike pedagogical agents

Lifelike animated agents for knowledge-based learning environments can provide timely, customized advice to support learners ’ problem-solving activities. By drawing on a rich repertoire of emotive behaviors to exhibit contextually appropriate facial expressions and emotive gestures, these agents could exploit the visual channel to more effectively communicate with learners. To address these issues, this article proposes the emotive-kinesthetic behavior sequencing framework for dynamically sequencing lifelike pedagogical agents’ full-body emotive expression. By exploiting a rich behavior space populated with emotive behaviors and structured by pedagogical speech act categories, a behavior sequencing engine operates in realtime to select and assemble contextually appropriate expressive behaviors. This framework has been implemented in a lifelike pedagogical agent, COSMO, who exhibits full-body emotive behaviors in response to learners' problem-solving activities.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
