Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing is a novel approach to automated document indexing which is based on a statistical latent class model for factor analysis of count data. Fitted from a training corpus of text documents by a generalization of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, the utilized model is able to deal with domain-specific synonymy as well as with polysemous words. In contrast to standard Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by Singular Value Decomposition, the probabilistic variant has a solid statistical foundation and defines a proper generative data model. Retrieval experiments on a number of test collections indicate substantial performance gains over direct term matching methodsaswell as over LSI. In particular, the combination of models with different dimensionalities has proven to be advantageous.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7460-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7460_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 11:25:15">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=99DFB5D725019CBFE81206A30BBA18F1?doi=10.1.1.195.3875&amp;rank=2</link><title>Marketing in Hypermedia Computer-Mediated Environments: Conceptual Foundations</title><description>Marketing in Hypermedia Computer-Mediated Environments: Conceptual Foundations

This paper describes our approaches to the opinion retrieval and blog distillation tasks for the Blog Track. For opinion retrieval we employ a two-stage framework consisting of keyword search and opinion classification, where customer reviews collected from Amazon.com are used for feature selection. For the blog distillation task we consider all the blog posts belonging to a blog in order to estimate the relevance of the blog at large. To accomplish this, we first identify relevant blogs for a given topic by keyword search and then examine all the posts for each identified blog. In addition, we attempt to detect and discard spam blogs (splogs) and non-English blogs to improve system performance. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7460-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7460_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 11:41:45">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=99DFB5D725019CBFE81206A30BBA18F1?doi=10.1.1.323.6948&amp;rank=8</link><title>Using the web to obtain frequencies for unseen bigrams.

This paper shows that the web can be employed to obtain frequencies for bigrams that are unseen in a given corpus. We describe a method for retrieving counts for adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verb-object bigrams from the web by querying a search engine. We evaluate this method by demonstrating: (a) a high correlation between web frequencies and corpus frequencies; (b) a reliable correlation between web frequencies and plausibility judgments; (c) a reliable correlation between web frequencies and frequencies recreated using class-based smoothing; (d) a good performance of web frequencies in a pseudo-disambiguation task.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7460-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7460_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 11:44:43">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=99DFB5D725019CBFE81206A30BBA18F1?doi=10.1.1.50.2161&amp;rank=9</link><title>Learning approaches for Detecting and Tracking News Events</title><description>Learning approaches for Detecting and Tracking News Events
