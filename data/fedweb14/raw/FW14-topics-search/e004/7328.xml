Abstract-The scale-space technique introduced by Witkin involves generating coarser resolution images by convolving the original image with a Gaussian kernel. This approach has a major drawback: it is difficult to obtain accurately the locations of the “semantically mean-ingful ” edges at coarse scales. In this paper we suggest a new definition of scale-space, and introduce a class of algorithms that realize it using a diffusion process. The diffusion coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing in preference to interregion smoothing. It is shown that the “no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales ” property of conventional scale space is pre-served. As the region boundaries in our approach remain sharp, we obtain a high quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information. Experimental results are shown on a number of images. The algorithm involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image making parallel hardware implementations feasible.

Constraint-based reasoning is a paradigm for formulating knowledge as a set of constraints without specifying the method by which these constraints are to be satisfied. A variety of techniques have been developed for finding partial or complete solutions for different kinds of constraint expressions. These have been successfully applied to diverse tasks such as design, diagnosis, truth maintenance, scheduling, spatiotemporal reasoning, logic programming and user interface. Constraint networks are graphical representations used to guide strategies for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7328-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7328_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 23:39:44">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=328E7F707C240B2D6158CBA8852D8544?doi=10.1.1.227.9472&amp;rank=10</link><title>"GrabCut” -- interactive foreground extraction using iterated graph cuts</title><description>"GrabCut” -- interactive foreground extraction using iterated graph cuts

The problem of efficient, interactive foreground/background segmentation in still images is of great practical importance in image editing. Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for “border matting ” has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
