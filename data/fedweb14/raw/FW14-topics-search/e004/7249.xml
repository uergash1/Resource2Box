In order to handle spatial data efficiently, as required in computer aided design and geo-data applications, a database system needs an index mechanism that will help it retrieve data items quickly according to their spatial locations However, traditional indexing methods are not well suited to data objects of non-zero size located m multi-dimensional spaces In this paper we describe a dynamic index structure called an R-tree which meets this need, and give algorithms for searching and updating it. We present the results of a series of tests which indicate that the structure performs well, and conclude that it is useful for current database systems in spatial applications.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7249-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7249_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 20:22:45">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D85F2223308E808214213925ECCD37CA?doi=10.1.1.228.3906&amp;rank=9</link><title>The Hungarian method for the assignment problem</title><description>The Hungarian method for the assignment problem

Abstract \- Cited by 758 (0 self) \- Add to MetaCart

Assuming that numerical scores are available for the performance of each of n persons on each of n jobs, the "assignment problem" is the quest for an assignment of persons to jobs so that the sum of the n scores so obtained is as large as possible. It is shown that ideas latent in the work of two Hungarian mathematicians may be exploited to yield a new method of solving this problem. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7249-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7249_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 20:23:02">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D85F2223308E808214213925ECCD37CA?doi=10.1.1.96.6637&amp;rank=10</link><title>The ubiquitous B-tree</title><description>The ubiquitous B-tree

B-trees have become, de facto, a standard for file organization. File indexes of users, dedicated database systems, and general-purpose access methods have all been proposed and nnplemented using B-trees This paper reviews B-trees and shows why they have been so successful It discusses the major variations of the B-tree, especially the B+-tree,</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
