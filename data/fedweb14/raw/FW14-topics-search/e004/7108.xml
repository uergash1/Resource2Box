Multi-threaded programming is difficult and error prone. It is easy to make a mistake in synchronization that produces a data race, yet it can be extremely hard to locate this mistake during debugging. This paper describes a new tool, called Eraser, for dynamically detecting data races in lock-based multi-threaded programs. Eraser uses binary rewriting techniques to monitor every shared memory reference and verify that consistent locking behavior is observed. We present several case studies, including undergraduate coursework and a multi-threaded Web search engine, that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7108-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7108_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 07:17:44">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=67CF0427F07133207D7BCC6251E3BF50?doi=10.1.1.123.7607&amp;rank=3</link><title>Optimization by simulated annealing</title><description>Optimization by simulated annealing

Large-scale networks of wireless sensors are becoming an active topic of research. Advances in hardware technology and engineering design have led to dramatic reductions in size, power consumption and cost for digital circuitry, wire-less communications and Micro ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS). This has enabled very compact, autonomous and mobile nodes, each containing one or more sensors, computation and communication capabilities, and a power supply. The missing ingredient is the networking and applications layers needed to harness this revolutionary capability into a complete system. We review the key elements of the emergent technology of “Smart Dust ” and outline the research challenges they present to the mobile networking and systems community, which must provide coherent connectivity to large numbers of mobile network nodes co-located within a small volume.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7108-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7108_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 07:20:01">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=67CF0427F07133207D7BCC6251E3BF50?doi=10.1.1.23.7000&amp;rank=5</link><title>Tamper Resistance -- a Cautionary Note</title><description>Tamper Resistance -- a Cautionary Note

An increasing number of systems, from pay-TV to electronic purses, rely on the tamper resistance of smartcards and other security processors. We describe a number of attacks on such systems -- some old, some new and some that are simply little known outside the chip testing community. We conclude that trusting tamper resistance is problematic; smartcards are broken routinely, and even a device that was described by a government signals agency as `the most secure processor generally available' turns out to be vulnerable. Designers of secure systems should consider the consequences with care.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7108-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7108_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 07:21:17">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=67CF0427F07133207D7BCC6251E3BF50?doi=10.1.1.197.9104&amp;rank=6</link><title>Auction Theory: A Guide to the Literature</title><description>Auction Theory: A Guide to the Literature

This paper provides an elementary, non-technical, survey of auction theory, by introducing and describing some of the critical papers in the subject. (The most important of these are reproduced in a companion book, The Economic Theory of Auctions, Paul Klemperer (ed.), Edward Elgar (pub.), forthcoming.) We begin with the most fundamental concepts, and then introduce the basic analysis of optimal auctions, the revenue equivalence theorem, and marginal revenues. Subsequent sections address risk-aversion, affiliation, asymmetries, entry, collusion, multi-unit auctions, double auctions, royalties, incentive contracts, and other topics. Appendices contain technical details, some simple worked examples, and a bibliography for each section.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7108-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7108_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 07:22:30">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=67CF0427F07133207D7BCC6251E3BF50?doi=10.1.1.163.2126&amp;rank=7</link><title>Some Evidence on the Importance of Sticky Prices</title><description>Some Evidence on the Importance of Sticky Prices

We examine the frequency of price changes for 350 categories of goods and services covering about 70 % of consumer spending, based on unpublished data from the BLS for 1995 to 1997. Compared with previous studies we find much more frequent price changes, with half of goods' prices lasting less than 4.3 months. Even excluding the role of temporary price cuts (sales), we find that half of goods' prices last 5.5 months or less. The frequency of price changes differs dramatically across categories. We exploit this variation to ask how inflation for "flexible-price goods" (goods with frequent changes in individual prices) differs from inflation for "sticky-price goods" (those displaying infrequent price changes). Compared to the predictions of popular sticky price models, actual inflation rates are far more volatile and transient, particularly for sticky-price goods.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7108-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7108_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 07:23:32">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=67CF0427F07133207D7BCC6251E3BF50?doi=10.1.1.21.1129&amp;rank=8</link><title>Kasbah: An Agent Marketplace for Buying and Selling Goods</title><description>Kasbah: An Agent Marketplace for Buying and Selling Goods

While there are many Web services which help users find things to buy,we know of none which actually try to automate the process of buying and selling. Kasbah is a virtual marketplace on the Web where users create autonomous agents to buy and sell goods on their behalf. Users specify parameters to guide and constrain an agent's overall behavior. A simple prototype has been built to test the viability of this concept.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7108-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7108_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 07:24:49">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=67CF0427F07133207D7BCC6251E3BF50?doi=10.1.1.131.6269&amp;rank=9</link><title>Data mules: Modeling a three-tier architecture for sparse sensor networks</title><description>Data mules: Modeling a three-tier architecture for sparse sensor networks

Abstract — This paper presents and analyzes an architecture that exploits the serendipitous movement of mobile agents in an environment to collect sensor data in sparse sensor networks. The mobile entities, called MULEs, pick up data from sensors when in close range, buffer it, and drop off the data to wired access points when in proximity. This leads to substantial power savings at the sensors as they only have to transmit over a short range. Detailed performance analysis is presented based on a simple model of the system incorporating key system variables such as number of MULEs, sensors and access points. The performance metrics observed are the data success rate (the fraction of generated data that reaches the access points) and the required buffer capacities on the sensors and the MULEs. The modeling along with simulation results can be used for further analysis and provide certain guidelines for deployment of such systems.

Abstract. This paper reports on a large-scale experiment introducing and evaluating intelligent tutoring in an urban High School setting. Critical to the success of this project has been a client-centered design approach that has matched our client's expertise in curricular objectives and classroom teaching with our expertise in artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. The Pittsburgh Urban Mathematics Project (PUMP) has produced an algebra curriculum that is centrally focused on mathematical analysis of real world situations and the use of computational tools. We have built an intelligent tutor, called PAT, that supports this curriculum and has been made a regular part of 9th grade Algebra in 3 Pittsburgh schools. In the 1993-94 school year, we evaluated the effect of the PUMP curriculum and PAT tutor use. On average the 470 students in experimental classes outperformed students in comparison classes by 15% on standardized tests and 100 % on tests targeting the PUMP objectives. This study provides further evidence that laboratory tutoring systems can be scaled up and made to work, both technically and pedagogically, in real and unforgiving settings like urban high schools. 1.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
