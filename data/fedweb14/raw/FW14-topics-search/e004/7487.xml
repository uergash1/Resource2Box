The highly successful architecture and protocols of today’s Internet may operate poorly in environments characterized by very long delay paths and frequent network partitions. These problems are exacerbated by end nodes with limited power or memory resources. Often deployed in mobile and extreme environments lacking continuous connectivity, many such networks have their own specialized protocols, and do not utilize IP. To achieve interoperability between them, we propose a network architecture and application interface structured around optionally-reliable asynchronous message forwarding, with limited expectations of end-to-end connectivity and node resources. The architecture operates as an overlay above the transport layers of the networks it interconnects, and provides key services such as in-network data storage and retransmission, interoperable naming, authenticated forwarding and a coarse-grained class of service.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7487-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7487_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 21:59:07">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C9EAC8DE74D77DFD467A00E17D2984DA?doi=10.1.1.18.4669&amp;rank=5</link><title>Intelligence without reason</title><description>Intelligence without reason

Computers and Thought are the two categories that together define Artificial Intelligence as a discipline. It is generally accepted that work in Artificial Intelligence over the last thirty years has had a strong influence on aspects of computer architectures. In this paper we also make the converse claim; that the state of computer architecture has been a strong influence on our models of thought. The Von Neumann model of computation has lead Artificial Intelligence in particular directions. Intelligence in biological systems is completely different. Recent work in behavior-based Artificial Intelligence has produced new models of intelligence that are much closer in spirit to biological systems. The non-Von Neumann computational models they use share many characteristics with biological computation.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7487-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7487_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 21:59:55">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C9EAC8DE74D77DFD467A00E17D2984DA?doi=10.1.1.132.7760&amp;rank=6</link><title>Learning to predict by the methods of temporal differences</title><description>Learning to predict by the methods of temporal differences

This article introduces a class of incremental learning procedures specialized for prediction – that is, for using past experience with an incompletely known system to predict its future behavior. Whereas conventional prediction-learning methods assign credit by means of the difference between predicted and actual outcomes, the new methods assign credit by means of the difference between temporally successive predictions. Although such temporal-difference methods have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods and they produce more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be applied to advantage.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7487-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7487_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 22:02:04">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C9EAC8DE74D77DFD467A00E17D2984DA?doi=10.1.1.11.6264&amp;rank=7</link><title>Agents and the Semantic Web</title><description>Agents and the Semantic Web

Many challenges of bringing communicating multiagent systems to the Web require ontologies. The integration of agent technology and ontologies could significantly affect the use of Web services and the ability to extend programs to perform tasks for users more efficiently and with less human intervention.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7487-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7487_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 22:03:34">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C9EAC8DE74D77DFD467A00E17D2984DA?doi=10.1.1.29.5833&amp;rank=8</link><title>Context-Aware Computing Applications</title><description>Context-Aware Computing Applications

This paper describes software that examines and reacts to an individual's changing context. Such software can promote and mediate people's interactions with devices, computers, and other people, and it can help navigate unfamiliar places. We believe that a limited amount of information covering a person's proximate environment is most important for this form of computing since the interesting part of the world around us is what we can see, hear, and touch. In this paper we define context-aware computing, and describe four categories of context-aware applications: proximate selection, automatic contextual reconfiguration, contextual information and commands, and context-triggered actions. Instances of these application types have been prototyped on the PARCTAB, a wireless, palm-sized computer.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7487-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7487_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 22:05:56">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C9EAC8DE74D77DFD467A00E17D2984DA?doi=10.1.1.211.5757&amp;rank=9</link><title>A Theory of Objects</title><description>A Theory of Objects

Object-oriented languages were invented to provide an intuitive view of data and computation, by drawing an analogy between software and the physical world of objects. The detailed explanation of this intuition, however, turned out to be quite complex; there are still no standard definitions of such fundamental notions as objects, classes, and inheritance. Much progress was made by investigating the notion of subtyping within procedural languages and their theoretical models (lambda calculi). These studies clarified the role of subtyping in object-oriented languages, but still relied on complex encodings to model object-oriented features. Recently, in joint work with Martin Abadi, I have studied more direct models of object-oriented features: object calculi. Object calculi embody, in a minimal setting, the object-oriented model of computation, as opposed to the imperative, functional, and process models. Object calculi are based exclusively on objects and methods, not on functions or data structures. They help in classifying and explaining the features of object-oriented languages, and in designing new, more regular languages. They directly inspired my design of Obliq, an object-oriented language for network programming.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7487-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7487_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 22:10:13">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C9EAC8DE74D77DFD467A00E17D2984DA?doi=10.1.1.134.20&amp;rank=10</link><title>End-to-End Internet Packet Dynamics</title><description>End-to-End Internet Packet Dynamics

We discuss findings from a large-scale study of Internet packet dynamics conducted by tracing 20 000 TCP bulk transfers between 35 Internet sites. Because we traced each 100-kbyte transfer at both the sender and the receiver, the measurements allow us to distinguish between the end-toend behaviors due to the different directions of the Internet paths, which often exhibit asymmetries. We: 1) characterize the prevalence of unusual network events such as out-of-order delivery and packet replication; 2) discuss a robust receiver-based algorithm for estimating “bottleneck bandwidth ” that addresses deficiencies discovered in techniques based on “packet pair;” 3) investigate patterns of packet loss, finding that loss events are not well modeled as independent and, furthermore, that the distribution of the duration of loss events exhibits infinite variance; and 4) analyze variations in packet transit delays as indicators of congestion periods, finding that congestion periods also span a wide range of time scales.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
