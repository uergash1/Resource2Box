We propose B-MAC, a carrier sense media access protocol for wireless sensor networks that provides a flexible interface to obtain ultra low power operation, effective collision avoidance, and high channel utilization. To achieve low power operation, B-MAC employs an adaptive preamble sampling scheme to reduce duty cycle and minimize idle listening. B-MAC supports on-the-fly reconfiguration and provides bidirectional interfaces for system services to optimize performance, whether it be for throughput, latency, or power conservation. We build an analytical model of a class of sensor network applications. We use the model to show the effect of changing B-MAC’s parameters and predict the behavior of sensor network applications. By comparing B-MAC to conventional 802.11inspired protocols, specifically S-MAC, we develop an experimental characterization of B-MAC over a wide range of network conditions. We show that B-MAC’s flexibility results in better packet delivery rates, throughput, latency, and energy consumption than S-MAC. By deploying a real world monitoring application with multihop networking, we validate our protocol design and model. Our results illustrate the need for flexible protocols to effectively realize energy efficient sensor network applications.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7127-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7127_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:47:59">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D322C752BA9494581D7113922399869D?doi=10.1.1.115.3107&amp;rank=10</link><title>Prediction of complete gene structures in human genomic DNA</title><description>Prediction of complete gene structures in human genomic DNA
