This paper presents a methodology for agent-oriented analysis and design. The methodology is general, in that it is applicable to a wide range of multi-agent systems, and comprehensive, in that it deals with both the macro-level (societal) and the micro-level (agent) aspects of systems. The methodology is founded on the view of a system as a computational organisation consisting of various interacting roles. We illustrate the methodology through a case study (an agent-based business process management system).</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7217-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7217_03.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 18:49:55">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=AA9F880F27031DAB321C6B9E0013D577?doi=10.1.1.132.4212&amp;rank=3</link><title>A Field Study of the Software Design Process for Large Systems</title><description>A Field Study of the Software Design Process for Large Systems

The problems of designing large software systems were studied through interviewing personnel from 17 large projects. A layered behavioral model is used to analyze how three lgf these problems-the thin spread of application domain knowledge, fluctuating and conflicting requirements, and communication bottlenecks and breakdowns-affected software productivity and quality through their impact on cognitive, social, and organizational processes.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7217-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7217_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 18:50:14">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=AA9F880F27031DAB321C6B9E0013D577?doi=10.1.1.114.3629&amp;rank=4</link><title>Unsupervised Models for Named Entity Classification</title><description>Unsupervised Models for Named Entity Classification

This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification. A large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classifier. However, we show that the use of unlabeled data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple “seed ” rules. The approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context in which it appears are sufficient to determine its type. We present two algorithms. The first method uses a similar algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated by (Blum and Mitchell 98). The second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98). 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7217-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7217_05.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 18:50:35">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=AA9F880F27031DAB321C6B9E0013D577?doi=10.1.1.154.5491&amp;rank=5</link><title>Organizations</title><description>Organizations

These notes discuss formalizing contexts as first class objects. The basic relation is ist(c; p). It asserts that the proposition p is true in the context c. The most important formulas relate the propositions true in different contexts. Introducing contexts as formal objects will permit axiomatizations in limited contexts to be expanded to transcend the original limitations. This seems necessary to provide AI programs using logic with certain capabilities that human fact representation and human reasoning possess. Fully implementing transcendence seems to require further extensions to mathematical logic, i.e. beyond the nonmonotonic inference methods first invented in AI and now studied as a new domain of logic. Various notations are considered, but these notes are tentative in not proposing a single language with all the desired capabilities.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7217-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7217_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 18:51:33">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=AA9F880F27031DAB321C6B9E0013D577?doi=10.1.1.145.5640&amp;rank=8</link><title>Vice President</title><description>Vice President
