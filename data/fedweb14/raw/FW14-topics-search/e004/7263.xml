The attached package contains background information prepared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the panel members of the advisory committee. The FDA background package often contains assessments and/or conclusions and recommendations written by individual FDA reviewers. Such conclusions and recommendations do not necessarily represent the final position of the individual reviewers, nor do they necessarily represent the final position of the Review Division or Office. We have brought this issue to this Advisory Committee in order to gain the Committee’s insights and opinions, and the background package may not include all issues relevant to the final regulatory recommendation and instead is intended to focus on issues identified by the Agency for discussion by the advisory committee. The FDA will not issue a final determination on the issues at hand until input from the advisory committee process has been considered and all reviews have been finalized.

This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7263-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7263_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 21:03:09">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3E4B25BC459E9498A94618F574C890DF?doi=10.1.1.274.9367&amp;rank=7</link><title>BMC Pulmonary Medicine BioMed Central</title><description>BMC Pulmonary Medicine BioMed Central

Multitask Learning is an approach to inductive transfer that improves generalization by using the domain information contained in the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7263-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7263_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 21:03:50">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3E4B25BC459E9498A94618F574C890DF?doi=10.1.1.107.5829&amp;rank=9</link><title>The swiss-prot protein knowledgebase and its supplement trembl in 2003</title><description>The swiss-prot protein knowledgebase and its supplement trembl in 2003
