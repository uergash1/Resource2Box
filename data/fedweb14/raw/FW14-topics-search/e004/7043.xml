We describe the design and implementation of a tool to help students learn the art of jazz improvisation. The tool integrates elements of database, AI in the form of automatic melody generation, and human interface design. We describe the philosophy of using several coordinated mini-languages to provide user specifications for various aspects of the tool, including melody and chord representation, styles, melody generation, and other musical knowledge.

Touch-sensitive tablets and their use in humancomputer interaction are discussed, It is shown that such devices have some important properties that differentiate them from other input devices (such as mice and joysticks). The analysis serves two purposes: (1) it sheds light on touch tablets, and (2) it demonstrates how other devices might be approached. Three specific distinctions between touch tablets and one button mice are drawn. These concern the signaling of events, multiple point sensing and the use of templates. These distinctions are reinforced, and possible uses of touch tablets are illustrated, in an example application. Potential enhancements to touch tablets and other input devices are discussed, as are some inherent problems. The paper concludes with recommendations for future work.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7043-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7043_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 20:42:35">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=89A6193D79C441D9941D55089E0809D2?doi=10.1.1.68.7606&amp;rank=9</link><title>A Matlab Toolbox to compute music similarity from audio</title><description>A Matlab Toolbox to compute music similarity from audio

A Matlab toolbox implementing music similarity measures for audio is presented. The implemented measures focus on aspects related to timbre and periodicities in the signal. This paper gives an overview of the implemented functions. In particular, the basics of the similarity measures are reviewed and some visualizations are discussed. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7043-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7043_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 20:43:15">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=89A6193D79C441D9941D55089E0809D2?doi=10.1.1.145.3307&amp;rank=10</link><title>The Bluesii</title><description>The Bluesii
