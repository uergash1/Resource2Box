Abstract \- Cited by 18 (1 self) \- Add to MetaCart

Southern hemisphere circulation patterns and associated anomalies for the austral winter 2008 are reviewed, with emphasis given to the Pacific Basin climate indicators and Australian rainfall and temperature patterns. Winter 2008 confirmed the indications seen in autumn 2008 of the end of the 2007/08 La Niña event. Australian seasonal maximum and minimum temperatures were generally close to average, consistent with the neutral state of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) were both in their positive phases, with rainfall generally below normal across southern Australia.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7054-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7054_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 22:28:18">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=F373EC1D466235C0F63E3344BD82382A?doi=10.1.1.376.1701&amp;rank=8</link><title>THE DEFORESTATION OF THE UPPER AWATERE</title><description>THE DEFORESTATION OF THE UPPER AWATERE

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

The Powerful Owl Ninox strenua is Australia’s largest owl, and is mainly found east of the Great Dividing Range on the mainland in tall-open forests. The species is considered rare, both nationally and in the State of Victoria; and threatened in the Greater Melbourne area. Recovery plans for the future conservation management of N. strenua are being prepared in 2 states. Historically, Powerful Owls have been thought to require large homes ranges (about 1000 ha per pair) in suitable old-growth forest, which provides nest hollows for the owls and their arboreal marsupial prey. Recent research, however, has found N. strenua may be more numerous and breed more successfully in a wider range of habitats than previously believed. In particular, the birds have been found living in forests and woodlands within the greater metropolitan areas of cities. The most extreme case is where a nest tree has been found within 800m of urban settlement and 6km from the centre of Brisbane. In this paper we report on the diet, habitat use, and conservation management by a number of breeding pairs of owls in outer urban Melbourne. Study sites range from a relatively undisturbed rainforest habitat 80km from central Melbourne, through dry sclerophyll, eucalyptus-dominated</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7054-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7054_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 22:30:37">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=F373EC1D466235C0F63E3344BD82382A?doi=10.1.1.193.8209&amp;rank=10</link><title>Estimate Reliability</title><description>Estimate Reliability

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

This newly-described subspecies has possibly already been hybridised out of existence. However, until confirmation of this, there is presumed to be a single, very small, decreasing population of pure-bred birds (Critically Endangered: C2b). Almost no information on the taxon exists, so it is listed on a precautionary basis.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
