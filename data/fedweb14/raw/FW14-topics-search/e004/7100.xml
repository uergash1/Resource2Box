The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7100-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7100_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:44:58">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=6D223F078B43A7FC6888203A889D0DF9?doi=10.1.1.40.1788&amp;rank=4</link><title>Differential Power Analysis</title><description>Differential Power Analysis

Cryptosystem designers frequently assume that secrets will be manipulated in closed, reliable computing environments. Unfortunately, actual computers and microchips leak information about the operations they process. This paper examines specific methods for analyzing power consumption measurements to find secret keys from tamper resistant devices. We also discuss approaches for building cryptosystems that can operate securely in existing hardware that leaks information.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7100-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7100_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:46:12">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=6D223F078B43A7FC6888203A889D0DF9?doi=10.1.1.111.5804&amp;rank=5</link><title>Introduction to Algorithms, second edition</title><description>Introduction to Algorithms, second edition

This part will get you started in thinking about designing and analyzing algorithms. It is intended to be a gentle introduction to how we specify algorithms, some of the design strategies we will use throughout this book, and many of the fundamental ideas used in algorithm analysis. Later parts of this book will build upon this base. Chapter 1 is an overview of algorithms and their place in modern computing systems. This chapter defines what an algorithm is and lists some examples. It also makes a case that algorithms are a technology, just as are fast hardware, graphical user interfaces, object-oriented systems, and networks. In Chapter 2, we see our first algorithms, which solve the problem of sorting a sequence of n numbers. They are written in a pseudocode which, although not directly translatable to any conventional programming language, conveys the structure of the algorithm clearly enough that a competent programmer can implement it in the language of his choice. The sorting algorithms we examine are insertion sort, which uses an incremental approach, and merge sort, which uses a recursive technique known as “divide and conquer.” Although the time each requires increases with the value of n, the rate of increase differs between the two algorithms. We determine these running times in Chapter 2, and we develop a useful notation to express them. Chapter 3 precisely defines this notation, which we call asymptotic notation. It starts by defining several asymptotic notations, which we use for bounding algorithm running times from above and/or below. The rest of Chapter 3 is primarily a presentation of mathematical notation. Its purpose is more to ensure that your use of notation matches that in this book than to teach you new mathematical concepts.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7100-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7100_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:47:17">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=6D223F078B43A7FC6888203A889D0DF9?doi=10.1.1.114.5140&amp;rank=6</link><title>Comparison of discrimination methods for the classification of tumors using gene expression data</title><description>Comparison of discrimination methods for the classification of tumors using gene expression data

A reliable and precise classification of tumors is essential for successful diagnosis and treatment of cancer. cDNA microarrays and high-density oligonucleotide chips are novel biotechnologies increasingly used in cancer research. By allowing the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands of genes simultaneously, microarray experiments may lead to a more complete understanding of the molecular variations among tumors and hence to a finer and more informative classification. The ability to successfully distinguish between tumor classes (already known or yet to be discovered) using gene expression data is an important aspect of this novel approach to cancer classification. This article compares the performance of different discrimination methods for the classification of tumors based on gene expression data. The methods include nearest-neighbor classifiers, linear discriminant analysis, and classification trees. Recent machine learning approaches, such as bagging and boosting, are also considered. The discrimination methods are applied to datasets from three recently published cancer gene expression studies.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7100-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7100_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:48:29">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=6D223F078B43A7FC6888203A889D0DF9?doi=10.1.1.30.3875&amp;rank=7</link><title>Irrelevant Features and the Subset Selection Problem</title><description>Irrelevant Features and the Subset Selection Problem

We address the problem of finding a subset of features that allows a supervised induction algorithm to induce small high-accuracy concepts. We examine notions of relevance and irrelevance, and show that the definitions used in the machine learning literature do not adequately partition the features into useful categories of relevance. We present definitions for irrelevance and for two degrees of relevance. These definitions improve our understanding of the behavior of previous subset selection algorithms, and help define the subset of features that should be sought. The features selected should depend not only on the features and the target concept, but also on the induction algorithm. We describe a method for feature subset selection using cross-validation that is applicable to any induction algorithm, and discuss experiments conducted with ID3 and C4.5 on artificial and real datasets.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7100-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7100_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:49:25">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=6D223F078B43A7FC6888203A889D0DF9?doi=10.1.1.18.5607&amp;rank=8</link><title>Topic-Sensitive PageRank</title><description>Topic-Sensitive PageRank

In the original PageRank algorithm for improving the ranking of search-query results, a single PageRank vector is computed, using the link structure of the Web, to capture the relative "importance" of Web pages, independent of any particular search query. To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. By using these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7100-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7100_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:50:40">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=6D223F078B43A7FC6888203A889D0DF9?doi=10.1.1.301.5370&amp;rank=9</link><title>Supervised and unsupervised discretization of continuous features</title><description>Supervised and unsupervised discretization of continuous features
