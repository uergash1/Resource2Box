Abstract. We present a hierarchical galaxy formation model which can account for the number counts of sources detected through their emission at sub-millimetre wavelengths. The first stage in our approach is an ab initio calculation of the star formation histories for a representative sample of galaxies, which is carried out using the semi-analytical galaxy formation model GALFORM. These star formation histories are then input into the spectro-photometric code GRASIL, to produce a spectral energy distribution for each galaxy. Dust extinction and emission are treated self consistently in our model, without having to resort to ad-hoc assumptions about the amount of attenuation by dust or the temperature at which the dust radiates. We argue that it is necessary to modify the form of the stellar initial mass function in starbursts in order to match the observed number of sub-mm sources, if we are to retain the previous good matches enjoyed between observations and model predictions in the local universe. We also list some other observational tests that have been passed by our model. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7004-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7004_03.html" timestamp="2014-05-15 13:41:14">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C39CCB976A02F796673478981135B4BB?doi=10.1.1.53.1835&amp;rank=3</link><title>The Quest for a Zero Overhead Shared Memory Parallel Machine</title><description>The Quest for a Zero Overhead Shared Memory Parallel Machine

The Zwicky Catalog of galaxies (ZC), with mZw 15:5, has been the basis for the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) redshift surveys. To date, analyses of the ZC and redshift surveys based on it have relied on heterogeneous sets of galaxy coordinates and redshifts. Here we correct some of the inadequacies of previous catalogs by providing: (1) coordinates with ! 2 00 errors for all of the 19,369 catalog galaxies, (2) homogeneously estimated redshifts for the majority (98%) of the data taken at the CfA (14,632 spectra), and (3) an estimate of the remaining "blunder" rate for both the CfA redshifts and for those compiled from the literature. For the reanalyzed CfA data we include a calibrated, uniformly determined error and an indication of the presence of emission lines in each spectrum. We provide redshifts for 7,257 galaxies in the CfA2 redshift survey not previously published; for another 5,625 CfA redshifts we list the remeasured or uniformly re-reduced value. Among our new measurements, 1,807 are members of UZC "multiplets" associated with the original Zwicky catalog position in the coordinate range where the catalog is 98% complete. These multiplets provide new candidates for examination of tidal interactions among galaxies. All of the new redshifts correspond to UZC galaxies with properties recorded in the CfA redshift compilation known as ZCAT. About 1,000 of our new measurements were motivated either by inadequate signal-to-noise in the original spectrum or by an ambiguous identification of the galaxy associated with a ZCAT redshift. The redshift catalog we include here is 96% complete to mZw 15:5, and 98% complete (12,925 galaxies out of a total of 13,150) for the right ascension ranges 20 h ff 1950 4 h and 8 h ff 1950 17 h and declination range \\...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7004-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7004_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-15 13:41:19">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C39CCB976A02F796673478981135B4BB?doi=10.1.1.52.1930&amp;rank=9</link><title>Performance Analysis of MD5</title><description>Performance Analysis of MD5

MD5 is an authentication algorithm proposed as the required implementation of the authentication option in IPv6. This paper presents an analysis of the speed at which MD5 can be implemented in software and hardware, and discusses whether its use interferes with high bandwidth networking. The analysis indicates that MD5 software currently runs at 85 Mbps on a 190 Mhz RISC architecture, a rate that cannot be improved more than 20-40%. Because MD5 processes the entire body of a packet, this data rate is insufficient for current high bandwidth networks, including HiPPI and FiberChannel. Further analysis indicates that a 300 Mhz custom VLSI CMOS hardware implementation of MD5 may run as fast as 256 Mbps. The hardware rate cannot support existing IPv4 data rates on high bandwidth links (800 Mbps HiPPI). The use of MD5 as the default required authentication algorithm in IPv6 should therefore be reconsidered, and an alternative should be proposed. This paper includes a brief description of the...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7004-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7004_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-15 13:41:20">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C39CCB976A02F796673478981135B4BB?doi=10.1.1.316.7620&amp;rank=10</link><title>Nuclear Activity in UZC Compact Groups of Galaxies</title><description>Nuclear Activity in UZC Compact Groups of Galaxies
