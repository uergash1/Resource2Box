The dynamic capabilities framework analyzes the sources and methods of wealth creation and capture by private enterprise firms operating in environments of rapid technological change. The competitive advantage of firms is seen as resting on distinctive processes (ways of coordinating and combining), shaped by the firm’s (specific) asset positions (such as the firm’s portfolio of difficult-to-trade knowledge assets and complementary assets), and the evolution path(s) it has adopted or inherited. The importance of path dependencies is amplified where conditions of increasing returns exist. Whether and how a firm’s competitive advantage is eroded depends on the stability of market demand, and the ease of replicability (expanding internally) and imitatability (replication by competitors). If correct, the framework suggests that private wealth creation in regimes of rapid technological change depends in large measure on honing internal technological, organizational, and managerial processes inside the firm. In short, identifying new opportunities and organizing effectively and efficiently to embrace them are generally more fundamental to private wealth creation than is strategizing, if by strategizing one means engaging in business conduct that keeps competitors off balance, raises rival’s costs, and excludes new entrants. © 1997 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7415-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7415_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 19:57:53">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=B81EDBCB14EB26537537EA6640BDC803?doi=10.1.1.117.6173&amp;rank=5</link><title>Learning to act using real-time dynamic programming</title><description>Learning to act using real-time dynamic programming

Abstract \- Cited by 540 (1 self) \- Add to MetaCart

Research dealing with various aspects of * the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy — value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory*s sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability. © 1991 Academic Press.

In which we try to give a basic intuitive sense of what reinforcement learning is and how it differs and relates to other fields, e.g., supervised learning and neural networks, genetic algorithms and artificial life, control theory. Intuitively, RL is trial and error (variation and selection, search) plus learning (association, memory). We argue that RL is the only field that seriously addresses the special features of the problem of learning from interaction to achieve long-term goals.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7415-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7415_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 20:00:26">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=B81EDBCB14EB26537537EA6640BDC803?doi=10.1.1.203.4133&amp;rank=8</link><title>A theory of fairness, competition and cooperation</title><description>A theory of fairness, competition and cooperation

Abstract \- Cited by 403 (33 self) \- Add to MetaCart

The use of information retrieval systems in networked environments raises a new set of issues that have received little attention. These issues include ranking document collections for relevance to a query, selecting the best set of collections from a ranked list, and merging the document rankings that are returned from a set of collections. This paper describes methods of addressing each issue in the inference network model, discusses their implementation in the INQUERY system, and presents experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
