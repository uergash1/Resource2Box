We present a new distributed routing protocol for mobile, multihop, wireless networks. The protocol is one of a family of protocols which we term "link reversal" algorithms. The protocol's reaction is structured as a temporally-ordered sequence of diffusing computations; each computation consisting of a sequence of directed l i nk reversals. The protocol is highly adaptive, efficient and scalable; being best-suited for use in large, dense, mobile networks. In these networks, the protocol's reaction to link failures typically involves only a localized "single pass" of the distributed algorithm. This capability is unique among protocols which are stable in the face of network partitions, and results in the protocol's high degree of adaptivity. This desirable behavior is achieved through the novel use of a "physical or logical clock" to establish the "temporal order" of topological change events which is used to structure (or order) the algorithm's reaction to topological changes. We refer to the protocol as the Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA).</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7456-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7456_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 09:50:57">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=68EA72E75EDF265CBF48B7090C121B74?doi=10.1.1.132.4609&amp;rank=4</link><title>Ariadne: A secure on-demand routing protocol for ad hoc networks</title><description>Ariadne: A secure on-demand routing protocol for ad hoc networks

An ad hoc network is a group of wireless mobile computers (or nodes), in which individual nodes cooperate by forwarding packets for each other to allow nodes to communicate beyond direct wireless transmission range. Prior research in ad hoc networking has generally studied the routing problem in a non-adversarial setting, assuming a trusted environment. In this paper, we present attacks against routing in ad hoc networks, and we present the design and performance evaluation of a new secure on-demand ad hoc network routing protocol, called Ariadne. Ariadne prevents attackers or compromised nodes from tampering with uncompromised routes consisting of uncompromised nodes, and also prevents a large number of types of Denial-of-Service attacks. In addition, Ariadne is efficient, using only highly efficient symmetric cryptographic primitives.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7456-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7456_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 09:54:15">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=68EA72E75EDF265CBF48B7090C121B74?doi=10.1.1.298.1586&amp;rank=5</link><title>A Scalable Location Service for Geographic Ad Hoc Routing</title><description>A Scalable Location Service for Geographic Ad Hoc Routing

GLS is a new distributed location service which tracks mobile node locations. GLS combined with geographic forwarding allows the construction of ad hoc mobile networks that scale to a larger number of nodes than possible with previous work. GLS is decentralized and runs on the mobile nodes themselves, requiring no fixed infrastructure. Each mobile node periodically updates a small set of other nodes (its location servers) with its current location. A node sends its position updates to its location servers without knowing their actual identities, assisted by a predefined ordering of node identifiers and a predefined geographic hierarchy. Queries for a mobile node’s location also use the predefined identifier ordering and spatial hierarchy to find a location server for that node. Experiments using the ns simulator for up to 600 mobile nodes show that the storage and bandwidth requirements of GLS grow slowly with the size of the network. Furthermore, GLS tolerates node failures well: each failure has only a limited effect and query performance degrades gracefully as nodes fail and restart. The query performance of GLS is also relatively insensitive to node speeds. Simple geographic forwarding combined with GLS compares favorably with Dynamic Source Routing (DSR): in larger networks (over 200 nodes) our approach delivers more packets, but consumes fewer network resources.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7456-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7456_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 09:56:03">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=68EA72E75EDF265CBF48B7090C121B74?doi=10.1.1.109.226&amp;rank=6</link><title>Service Disciplines for Guaranteed Performance Service in Packet-Switching Networks</title><description>Service Disciplines for Guaranteed Performance Service in Packet-Switching Networks

While today’s computer networks support only best-effort service, future packet-switching integrated-services networks will have to support real-time communication services that allow clients to transport information with performance guarantees expressed in terms of delay, delay jitter, throughput, and loss rate. An important issue in providing guaranteed performance service is the choice of the packet service discipline at switching nodes. In this paper, we survey several service disciplines that are proposed in the literature to provide per-connection end-to-end peqormance guarantees in packet-switching networks. We describe their mechanisms, their similarities and differences, and the performance guarantees they can provide. Various issues and tradeoffs in designing service disciplines for guaranteed performance service are discussed, and a general framework for studying and comparing these disciplines are presented.

Context-enabled applications are just emerging and promise richer interaction by taking environmental context into account. However, they are difficult to build due to their distributed nature and the use of unconventional sensors. The concepts of toolkits and widget libraries in graphical user interfaces has been tremendously successtil, allowing programmers to leverage off existing building blocks to build interactive systems more easily. We introduce the concept of context widgets that mediate between the environment and the application in the same way graphical widgets mediate between the user and the application. We illustrate the concept of context widgets with the beginnings of a widget library we have developed for sensing presence, identity and activity of people and things. We assess the success of our approach with two example context-enabled applications we have built and an existing application to which we have added contextsensing capabilities.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7456-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7456_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 10:02:43">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=68EA72E75EDF265CBF48B7090C121B74?doi=10.1.1.28.2247&amp;rank=8</link><title>Behavior-based Formation Control for Multi-robot Teams</title><description>Behavior-based Formation Control for Multi-robot Teams

New reactive behaviors that implement formations in multi-robot teams are presented and evaluated. The formation behaviors are integrated with other navigational behaviors to enable a robotic team to reach navigational goals, avoid hazards and simultaneously remain in formation. The behaviors are implemented in simulation, on robots in the laboratory and aboard DARPA's HMMWV-based Unmanned Ground Vehicles. The technique has been integrated with the Autonomous Robot Architecture (AuRA) and the UGV Demo II architecture. The results demonstrate the value of various types of formations in autonomous, human-led and communications-restricted applications, and their appropriateness in different types of task environments.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7456-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7456_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 10:06:39">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=68EA72E75EDF265CBF48B7090C121B74?doi=10.1.1.177.4643&amp;rank=9</link><title>Games and decisions</title><description>Games and decisions

In the original PageRank algorithm for improving the ranking of search-query results, a single PageRank vector is computed, using the link structure of the Web, to capture the relative "importance" of Web pages, independent of any particular search query. To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. By using these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
