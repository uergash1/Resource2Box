Abstract—This paper is part of a broader research effort which seeks to develop an understanding of the fundamental dynamics that govern innovation in the space sector. Framing the space innovation enterprise as a series of control loops, it highlights the critical functions of project prioritization (which balance science needs, technical feasibility and budgetary constraints) and the strategic orientation of technology development (bucketing funding opportunities in terms of 1) generic technology programs in S&amp;T organizations or branches; 2) advanced technology programs addressing specific future needs; and 3) near term technology maturation programs to support identified gaps for particular programs). It examines each of NASA’s, ESA’s and the DoD’s space innovation systems, providing a preliminary analysis of key differences in their approaches. The paper concludes by laying out the next steps in the overall research project.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7200-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7200_06.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 18:11:04">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=BCEB76B333C51A66611832E97A703222?doi=10.1.1.186.9987&amp;rank=6</link><title>About the Authors</title><description>About the Authors

For 20 years, BASIC has worked as an independent research and advocacy organisation. Our research is respected and trusted, and widely used by many other organisations and individuals. We focus on transatlantic security and arms control issues as a means of creating a more stable and secure world. With offices, staff, advisers and patrons on both sides of the Atlantic, we play a unique role as a transatlantic bridge for policy makers and opinion shapers.

ABSTRACT: The space industry plays a central role in American security, foreign policy, prosperity and prestige. Today, American space capabilities surpass those of any other nation and U.S. technology continues to set the standard for global competitors. However, the space industry throughout the world has entered an economic depression without precedent in its history. Financially and demographically, the sector bears a closer resemblance to moribund industries like shipbuilding than it does to the infant, high technology business it is. 1 Massive over-capacity exists in both launch services and spacecraft manufacturing, and once-growing companies are downsizing and/or merging to survive. Additionally, the U.S. space industry is more reliant on the government as an anchor tenant than at any time in the last decade. The Space Commission Report highlights the danger: “The U.S. Government, as a consumer, a regulator or an investor, is currently not a good partner to the national security space industry. ” 2 Unless a greater government commitment and clarity of vision emerges, the overall industry will struggle through adolescence and the commercial sector may never reach maturity.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7200-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7200_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 18:11:54">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=BCEB76B333C51A66611832E97A703222?doi=10.1.1.175.3493&amp;rank=9</link><title>BLASTS Types of Blast Injuries</title><description>BLASTS Types of Blast Injuries
