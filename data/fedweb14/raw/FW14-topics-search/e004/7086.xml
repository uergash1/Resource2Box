Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

This paper describes and explains some of the principal trends in the wage and skill distribution in recent decades. There have been sharp increases in wage inequality across the OECD, beginning with the US and UK at the end of the 1970s. A good fraction of this inequality growth is due to technology-related increases in the demand for skilled workers outstripping the growth of their supply. Since the early 1990s, labour markets have become more polarized with jobs in the middle third of the wage distribution shrinking and those in the bottom and top third rising. I argue that this is because computerization complements the most skilled tasks, but substitutes for routine tasks performed by middle wage occupations such as clerks, leaving the demand for the lowest skilled service tasks largely unaffected. Finally, I argue that technology is partly endogenous, for example it has been spurred by trade with China. Thus, trade does matter for changes in the labour market through inducing faster technical change rather than just through the conventional Heckscher-Ohlin</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7086-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7086_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 03:21:10">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=56D94C7A5C201E9F229F7A3D32210E49?doi=10.1.1.178.7415&amp;rank=5</link><title>21st Century Learner</title><description>21st Century Learner

Abstract. Due to the ever increasing flow of (digital) information in today’s society, journalists struggle to manage and assess this abundance of data in terms of their newsworthiness. Although theoretical analyses and mechanisms exist to determine if something is worth publishing, applying these techniques requires substantial domain knowledge and know-how. Furthermore, the consumer’s need for near-immediate reporting significantly limits the time for journalists to select and produce content. In this paper, we propose an approach to automate the process of newsworthiness assessment, by applying recent Semantic Web technologies to verify theoretically determined news criteria. We implemented a proof-of-concept application that generates a newsworthiness profile for a user-specified news item. A preliminary evaluation by manual verification was performed, resulting in 83.93 % precision and 66.07% recall. However, further evaluation by domain experts is needed. To conclude, we outline the possible implications of our approach on both the technical and journalistic domains.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7086-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7086_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 03:25:48">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=56D94C7A5C201E9F229F7A3D32210E49?doi=10.1.1.134.1862&amp;rank=9</link><title>for 21st-Century Biologists</title><description>for 21st-Century Biologists

Galileo wrote that “the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics”; his quantitative approach to understanding the natural world arguably marks the beginning of modern science. Nearly 400 years later,the fragmented teaching of science in our universities still leaves biology outside the quantitative and mathematical culture that has come to define the physical sciences and engineering. This strikes us as particularly inopportune at a time when opportunities for quantitative thinking about biological systems are exploding. We propose that a way out of this dilemma is a unified introductory science curriculum that fully incorporates mathematics and quantitative thinking. Dramatic advances in biological understanding, coupled with equally dramatic advances in experimental techniques and computational analyses, are transforming the science of biology.
