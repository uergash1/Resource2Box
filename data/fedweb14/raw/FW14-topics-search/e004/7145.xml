Peer-to-peer file-sharing networks are currently receiving much attention as a means of sharing and distributing information. However, as recent experience with P2P networks such as Gnutella shows, the anonymous, open nature of these networks offers an almost ideal environment for the spread of self-replicating inauthentic files.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7145-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7145_02.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 15:35:34">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=DB4EF300631497C9C6C3C1C7B08F146E?doi=10.1.1.381.877&amp;rank=2</link><title>Some philosophical problems from the standpoint of artificial intelligence</title><description>Some philosophical problems from the standpoint of artificial intelligence

The support vector machine (SVM) is a popular classification technique. However, beginners who are not familiar with SVM often get unsatisfactory results since they miss some easy but significant steps. In this guide, we propose a simple procedure which usually gives reasonable results.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7145-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7145_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 15:37:11">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=DB4EF300631497C9C6C3C1C7B08F146E?doi=10.1.1.47.8186&amp;rank=7</link><title>The Role of Emotion in Believable Agents</title><description>The Role of Emotion in Believable Agents

Abstract \- Cited by 416 (1 self) \- Add to MetaCart

Artificial intelligence researchers attempting to create engaging, apparently living creatures may find important insight in the work of artists who have explored the idea of believable character. In particular, appropriately timed and clearly expressed emotion is a central requirement for believable characters. We discuss these ideas and suggest how they may apply to believable interactive characters, which we call "believable agents."

Abstract. The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge ran from February to March 2005. The goal of the challenge was to recognize objects from a number of visual object classes in realistic scenes (i.e. not pre-segmented objects). Four object classes were selected: motorbikes, bicycles, cars and people. Twelve teams entered the challenge. In this chapter we provide details of the datasets, algorithms used by the teams, evaluation criteria, and results achieved. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7145-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7145_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 15:37:52">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=DB4EF300631497C9C6C3C1C7B08F146E?doi=10.1.1.124.2820&amp;rank=9</link><title>Learning and development in neural networks: The importance of starting small</title><description>Learning and development in neural networks: The importance of starting small

It is a striking fact that in humans the greatest learnmg occurs precisely at that point in time- childhood- when the most dramatic maturational changes also occur. This report describes possible synergistic interactions between maturational change and the ability to learn a complex domain (language), as investigated in con-nectionist networks. The networks are trained to process complex sentences involving relative clauses, number agreement, and several types of verb argument structure. Training fails in the case of networks which are fully formed and ‘adultlike ’ in their capacity. Training succeeds only when networks begin with limited working memory and gradually ‘mature ’ to the adult state. This result suggests that rather than being a limitation, developmental restrictions on resources may constitute a necessary prerequisite for mastering certain complex domains. Specifically, successful learning may depend on starting small.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7145-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7145_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 15:38:12">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=DB4EF300631497C9C6C3C1C7B08F146E?doi=10.1.1.13.9046&amp;rank=10</link><title>The Logic of Typed Feature Structures</title><description>The Logic of Typed Feature Structures
