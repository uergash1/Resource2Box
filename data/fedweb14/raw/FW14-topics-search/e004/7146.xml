Abstract \- Cited by 998 (7 self) \- Add to MetaCart

This paper considers a firm that must issue common stock to raise cash to undertake a valuable investment opportunity. Management is assumed to know more about the firm’s value than potential investors. Investors interpret the firm’s actions rationally. An. equilibrium mode1 of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The mode1 shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required. Extensions and applications of the model are discussed. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7146-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7146_03.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 15:39:18">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=FBD6F3416DAC4AB2926081F9F13B2230?doi=10.1.1.335.5296&amp;rank=3</link><title>Why a diagram is (sometimes) worth ten thousand words</title><description>Why a diagram is (sometimes) worth ten thousand words

We distinguish diagrammatic from sentential paper-and-pencil representationsof information by developing alternative models of information-processing systems that are informationally equivalent and that can be characterized as sentential or diagrammatic. Sentential representations are sequential, like the propositions in a text. Dlogrammotlc representations ore indexed by location in a plane. Dio-grommatic representations also typically display information that is only implicit in sententiol representations and that therefore has to be computed, sometimes at great cost, to make it explicit for use. We then contrast the computational efficiency of these representotions for solving several illustrative problems in mothe-matics and physics. When two representotions are informationally equivolent, their computational efficiency depends on the information-processing operators that act on them. Two sets of operators may differ in their copobilities for recognizing patterns, in the inferences they con carry out directly, and in their control strategies (in portitular. the control of search).
