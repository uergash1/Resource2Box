Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy. 1. Introduction A learning set of L consists of data f(y n ; x n ), n = 1; : : : ; Ng where the y's are either class labels or a numerical response.

Many challenges of bringing communicating multiagent systems to the Web require ontologies. The integration of agent technology and ontologies could significantly affect the use of Web services and the ability to extend programs to perform tasks for users more efficiently and with less human intervention.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7448-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7448_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 06:47:38">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D70BE09507FCEBE5968FCF3362117828?doi=10.1.1.91.2433&amp;rank=6</link><title>Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</title><description>Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures

The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7448-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7448_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 06:50:12">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D70BE09507FCEBE5968FCF3362117828?doi=10.1.1.192.8630&amp;rank=7</link><title>The strength of weak learnability</title><description>The strength of weak learnability

Abstract. This paper addresses the problem of improving the accuracy of an hypothesis output by a learning algorithm in the distribution-free (PAC) learning model. A concept class is learnable (or strongly learnable) if, given access to a Source of examples of the unknown concept, the learner with high probability is able to output an hypothesis that is correct on all but an arbitrarily small fraction of the instances. The concept class is weakly learnable if the learner can produce an hypothesis that performs only slightly better than random guessing. In this paper, it is shown that these two notions of learnability are equivalent. A method is described for converting a weak learning algorithm into one that achieves arbitrarily high accuracy. This construction may have practical applications as a tool for efficiently converting a mediocre learning algorithm into one that performs extremely well. In addition, the construction has some interesting theoretical consequences, including a set of general upper bounds on the complexity of any strong learning algorithm as a function of the allowed error e.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7448-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7448_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 06:52:23">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D70BE09507FCEBE5968FCF3362117828?doi=10.1.1.14.5614&amp;rank=8</link><title>Automatic Acquisition of Hyponyms from Large Text Corpora</title><description>Automatic Acquisition of Hyponyms from Large Text Corpora

We describe a method for the automatic acquisition of the hyponymy lexical relation from unrestricted text. Two goals motivate the approach: (i) avoidante of the need for pre-encoded knowledge and (ii) applicability across a wide range of text. We identify a set of lexico-syntactic patterns that are easily recognizable, that occur frequently and across text genre boundaries, and that indisputably indicate the lexical relation of interest. We describe a method for discovering these patterns and suggest that other lexical relations will also he acquirable iu this way. A subset of the acquisitiou algorithm is implemented and the results are used to augment and critique the structure of a large hand-built thesaurus. Extensions and applications to areas such as information retrieval are suggested.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7448-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7448_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 06:54:44">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=D70BE09507FCEBE5968FCF3362117828?doi=10.1.1.221.2247&amp;rank=9</link><title>Wireless sensor networks: a survey</title><description>Wireless sensor networks: a survey

The Internet presents numerous sources of useful information---telephone directories, product catalogs, stock quotes, weather forecasts, etc. Recently, many systems have been built that automatically gather and manipulate such information on a user's behalf. However, these resources are usually formatted for use by people (e.g., the relevant content is embedded in HTML pages), so extracting their content is difficult. Wrappers are often used for this purpose. A wrapper is a procedure for extracting a particular resource's content. Unfortunately, hand-coding wrappers is tedious. We introduce wrapper induction, a technique for automatically constructing wrappers. Our techniques can be described in terms of three main contributions. First, we pose the problem of wrapper construction as one of inductive learn...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
