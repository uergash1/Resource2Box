THIS chapter introduces three arguments that share a single conclusion: that a comprehensive science of language cannot (and should not try to) describe relations of semantic reference, i.e. word-world relations. Spelling this out, if there is to be a genuine science of linguistic meaning (yielding theoretical insight into underlying realities, aiming for integration with other natural sciences), then a theory of meaning cannot involve assigning external, real-world, objects to names, nor sets of external objects to predicates, nor truth values (or world-bound thoughts) to sentences. Most of the chapter tries to explain and defend this broad conclusion. The chapter also presents, in a very limited way, a positive alternative to external-referent semantics for expressions. This alternative has two parts: first, that the meanings of words and sentences are mental instructions, not external things; second, as Strawson (1950) stressed, that it is people who refer (and who express thoughts) by using words and sentences, and wordlsentence meanings play but a partial role in allowing speakers to talk about the world.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7258-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7258_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 20:45:50">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5529871D26CB6494AE42638B7B158ECE?doi=10.1.1.401.3125&amp;rank=4</link><title>By Njuguna Mwangi Linkages Between Globilisation, the Resultant Consumption Patterns, and the Impact on Human Development- Country Study on Kenya,</title><description>By Njuguna Mwangi Linkages Between Globilisation, the Resultant Consumption Patterns, and the Impact on Human Development- Country Study on Kenya,

ganized in language"0.4). Conceptual content includes affect and perception--only accessible through introspection, which must be employed with "controlled manipulation of linguistic material" (I.5)--that is, correlation with other findings across languages and other sciences. Talmy pays closer attention to meaningform mappings than do many writers on semantics. He is best known for bringing the notions of Figure and Ground--a schematic system of attention--into linguistics in the early 1970s. "In Figure-Ground organization, the entity that functions as the Figure of a situation attracts focal attention and is the entity whose characteristics and fate are of concern. The Ground entity is in the periphery of attention and functions as a reference entity used to characterize the Figural properties of concern" (I.12-13). It is within this framework that the book is written. 1 There are inconsistencies; for example, there is no explanation when it is first mentioned of Atsugewi's affiliat</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7258-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7258_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 20:47:06">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5529871D26CB6494AE42638B7B158ECE?doi=10.1.1.184.869&amp;rank=8</link><title>Computational Morphology and the Teaching of Indigenous Languages Michael Gasser</title><description>Computational Morphology and the Teaching of Indigenous Languages Michael Gasser

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

Computer-assisted language learning is by now so common around the world as to be something of a default, and the teaching of the indigenous languages of the Americas is already benefiting from the new technology. Intelligent computer-assisted language learning relies on software that has relatively sophisticated models of the target language and/or the learner. An example is the use of a program that has an explicit model of some aspect of the grammar of the target language and can analyze or generate words or sentences. Many indigenous languages of the Americas are characterized by complex morphology, and morphology must play a significant role in the instruction of these languages. This paper describes how morphological analyzers and generators can handle the complex morphology of languages such as K’iche ’ and Quechua and discusses a potential application of this technology to the teaching of such languages. Computer-Assisted Language Learning In recent years, computers have become so important in language teaching that it hard to imagine a class without them. Students use computers to do exercises practicing what they have learned in the class, they access documents from the Internet, they interact with other learners or with native speakers of</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7258-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7258_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 20:47:27">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5529871D26CB6494AE42638B7B158ECE?doi=10.1.1.365.1053&amp;rank=9</link><title>– Word sense disambiguation From Isolating to Agglutinating</title><description>– Word sense disambiguation From Isolating to Agglutinating
