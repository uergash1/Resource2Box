Categorizations which humans make of the concrete world are not arbitrary but highly determined. In taxonomies of concrete objects, there is one level of abstraction at which the most basic category cuts are made. Basic categories are those which carry the most information, possess the highest category cue validity, and are, thus, the most differentiated from one another. The four experiments of Part I define basic objects by demonstrating that in taxonomies of common concrete nouns in English based on class inclusion, basic objects are the most inclusive categories whose members: (a) possess significant numbers of attributes in common, (b) have motor programs which are similar to one another, (c) have similar shapes, and (d) can be identified from averaged shapes of members of the class. The eight experiments of Part II explore implications of the structure of categories. Basic objects are shown to be the most inclusive categories for which a concrete image of the category as a whole can be formed, to be the first categorizations made during perception of the environment, to be the earliest categories sorted and earliest named by children, and to be the categories</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7045-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7045_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 20:56:19">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C5FCD4876C4D83C8037DA320173BB793?doi=10.1.1.136.1345&amp;rank=2</link><title>Relations between the statistics of natural images and the response properties of cortical cells</title><description>Relations between the statistics of natural images and the response properties of cortical cells
