Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

A 311 system provides quick and easy access to non-emergency municipal services and information through a consolidated channel. This study explores the operation of 311 contact centers in New York and Philadelphia and identifies critical success factors and challenges of 311-driven service integration. Analyzing the qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with 311 center staff and city government officials, the study presents some key findings. Having the right technology in the right time is identified as a critical technological factor. While the lack of interoperability between a 311 system and departmental legacy systems remains a major technical barrier to connecting a variety of systems, human agents fill the middle ground so that training for qualified agents is crucial for their role. Inter-agency coordination and collaboration is pivotal to creating and updating service level agreements and knowledgebase. However, turf protection raises cross-organizational concerns. The mayor’s strong leadership, political champions, and the executive support help resolve interdepartmental conflicts. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7176-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7176_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 17:16:50">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=0CADCFC69B80D6FCED9C3CFB8F7AA123?doi=10.1.1.148.6539&amp;rank=4</link><title>Strategic Weather-Related Decisions</title><description>Strategic Weather-Related Decisions
