The dynamic capabilities framework analyzes the sources and methods of wealth creation and capture by private enterprise firms operating in environments of rapid technological change. The competitive advantage of firms is seen as resting on distinctive processes (ways of coordinating and combining), shaped by the firm’s (specific) asset positions (such as the firm’s portfolio of difficult-to-trade knowledge assets and complementary assets), and the evolution path(s) it has adopted or inherited. The importance of path dependencies is amplified where conditions of increasing returns exist. Whether and how a firm’s competitive advantage is eroded depends on the stability of market demand, and the ease of replicability (expanding internally) and imitatability (replication by competitors). If correct, the framework suggests that private wealth creation in regimes of rapid technological change depends in large measure on honing internal technological, organizational, and managerial processes inside the firm. In short, identifying new opportunities and organizing effectively and efficiently to embrace them are generally more fundamental to private wealth creation than is strategizing, if by strategizing one means engaging in business conduct that keeps competitors off balance, raises rival’s costs, and excludes new entrants. © 1997 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7219-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7219_02.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 18:55:57">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=211FDB6BCB9A095B617E2A91A26E18B8?doi=10.1.1.201.9742&amp;rank=2</link><title>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</title><description>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

It has been said that educational works are extraneous to evaluation due to their special character and forced evaluation would have negative effects. As our society has acknowledged the necessity of information disclosure, accountability, and other democracy-functioning measures, however, emphasis on achievement, customers, and market is also placed in school education management. This is a shift from conventional prior control based on a standard (traditional bureaucratic system) to “management of results ” based on the NPM system that emphasizes ex-post assessment. Under these circumstances, schools and teachers now undertake a central role in responsibility for the results of education released to the market. The “Educational Personnel Evaluation System in Tokyo Metropolitan ” (hereafter referred to as the Evaluation System) was introduced in April 2000 as a pioneering teacher evaluation system. Toyokazu Urano1 criticized that the Evaluation System either did not attain its aim, or failed. When I conducted a hearing survey (hereafter referred to as the interview) on the Evaluation System in public junior high schools in Tokyo, it was my impression that both evaluators and evaluatees were skeptical about</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7219-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7219_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 18:56:33">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=211FDB6BCB9A095B617E2A91A26E18B8?doi=10.1.1.335.9574&amp;rank=4</link><title>YOKO HONDA AND SHUJI HONDA 1</title><description>YOKO HONDA AND SHUJI HONDA 1

Mutations in genes affecting endocrine signaling, stress responses, metabolism, and telomeres can all increase the life spans of model organisms. These mutations have revealed evolutionarily conserved pathways for aging, some of which appear to extend life span in response to sensory cues, caloric restric-tion, or stress. Many mutations affecting longevity pathways delay age-related disease, and the molecu-lar analysis of these pathways is leading to a mechanistic understanding of how these two processes— aging and disease susceptibility—are linked.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7219-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7219_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 18:57:51">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=211FDB6BCB9A095B617E2A91A26E18B8?doi=10.1.1.142.4792&amp;rank=8</link><title>Elements of Interaction</title><description>Elements of Interaction

We describe a novel approach for clustering col-lections of sets, and its application to the analysis and mining of categorical data. By “categorical data, ” we mean tables with fields that cannot be naturally ordered by a metric- e.g., the names of producers of automobiles, or the names of prod-ucts offered by a manufacturer. Our approach is based on an iterative method for assigning and propagating weights on the categorical values in a table; this facilitates a type of similarity mea-sure arising from the co-occurrence of values in the dataset. Our techniques can be studied an-alytically in terms of certain types of non-linear dynamical systems. We discuss experiments on a variety of tables of synthetic and real data; we find that our iterative methods converge quickly to prominently correlated values of various cate-gorical fields. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7219-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7219_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 18:58:31">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=211FDB6BCB9A095B617E2A91A26E18B8?doi=10.1.1.271.7091&amp;rank=10</link><title>Insights &amp; Perspectives</title><description>Insights &amp; Perspectives
