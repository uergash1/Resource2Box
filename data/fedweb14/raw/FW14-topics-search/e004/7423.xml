Abstract \- Cited by 397 (11 self) \- Add to MetaCart

This paper develops a theory of the allocation of formal authority (the right to decide) and real authority (the effective control over decisions) within organizations, and it illustrates how a formally integrated structure can accommodate various degrees of "real" integration. Real authority is determined by the structure of information, which in turn depends on the allocation of formal authority. An increase in an agent's real authority promotes initiative but results in a loss of control for the principal. After spelling out (some of) the main determinants of the delegation of formal authority within organizations, the paper examines a number of factors that increase the subordinates ' real authority in a formally integrated structure: overload, lenient rules, urgency of decision, reputation, performance measurement, and multiplicity of superiors. Finally, the amount of communication in an organization is shown to depend on the allocation of formal authority.

Since 1984, the Condor project has enabled ordinary users to do extraordinary computing. Today, the project continues to explore the social and technical problems of cooperative computing on scales ranging from the desktop to the world-wide computational grid. In this chapter, we provide the history and philosophy of the Condor project and describe how it has interacted with other projects and evolved along with the field of distributed computing. We outline the core components of the Condor system and describe how the technology of computing must correspond to social structures. Throughout, we reflect on the lessons of experience and chart the course traveled by research ideas as they grow into production systems.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7423-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7423_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:45:06">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=094604A457BE9364716BEF8CDBD0F4D7?doi=10.1.1.116.3382&amp;rank=7</link><title>From data mining to knowledge discovery in databases</title><description>From data mining to knowledge discovery in databases

The Clustal series of programs are widely used in molecular biology for the multiple alignment of both nucleic acid and protein sequences and for preparing phylogenetic trees. The popularity of the programs depends on a number of factors, including not only the accuracy of the results, but also the robustness, portability and user-friendliness of the programs. New features include NEXUS and FASTA format output, printing range numbers and faster tree calculation. Although, Clustal was originally developed to run on a local computer, numerous Web servers have been set up, notably at the EBI</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7423-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7423_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:46:01">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=094604A457BE9364716BEF8CDBD0F4D7?doi=10.1.1.195.1674&amp;rank=9</link><title>Executive Compensation</title><description>Executive Compensation

This paper summarizes the empirical and theoretical research on executive compensation and provides a comprehensive and up-to-date description of pay practices (and trends in pay practices) for chief executive officers (CEOs). Topics discussed include the level and structure of CEO pay (including detailed analyses of annual bonus plans, executive stock options, and option valuation), international pay differences, the pay-setting process, the relation between CEO pay and firm performance (“pay-performance sensitivities”), the relation between sensitivities and subsequent firm performance, relative performance evaluation, executive turnover, and the politics of CEO pay.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7423-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7423_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:46:34">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=094604A457BE9364716BEF8CDBD0F4D7?doi=10.1.1.198.6817&amp;rank=10</link><title>European Unemployment Dilemma</title><description>European Unemployment Dilemma
