In this paper we analyse the well known Needham-Schroeder Public-Key Protocol using FDR, a refinement checker for CSP. We use FDR to discover an attack upon the protocol, which allows an intruder to impersonate another agent. We adapt the protocol, and then use FDR to show that the new protocol is secure, at least for a small system. Finally we prove a result which tells us that if this small system is secure, then so is a system of arbitrary size. 1 Introduction In a distributed computer system, it is necessary to have some mechanism whereby a pair of agents can be assured of each other's identity---they should become sure that they really are talking to each other, rather than to an intruder impersonating the other agent. This is the role of an authentication protocol. In this paper we use the Failures Divergences Refinement Checker (FDR) [11, 5], a model checker for CSP, to analyse the Needham-Schroeder PublicKey Authentication Protocol [8]. FDR takes as input two CSP processes, ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7083-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7083_05.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:13:20">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3539DF54F9397EE30BA0671A1DF90762?doi=10.1.1.132.5942&amp;rank=5</link><title>Color indexing</title><description>Color indexing

In a system in which noncooperative agents share a common resource, we propose the ratio between the worst possible Nash equilibrium and the social optimum as a measure of the effectiveness of the system. Deriving upper and lower bounds for this ratio in a model in which several agents share a very simple network leads to some interesting mathematics, results, and open problems.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7083-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7083_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:13:50">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3539DF54F9397EE30BA0671A1DF90762?doi=10.1.1.206.1458&amp;rank=7</link><title>Metaphors We Live By</title><description>Metaphors We Live By

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

In 1794, Bayford described the post-mortem findings of a woman with life-long dysphagia who eventually died of starvation, caused by oesophageal obstruction. ' At post-mortem a right subclavian artery was identified passing aberrantly from a left-sided aortic arch behind the oesophagus, causing the woman's dysphagia. Dr Bayford referred to this extraordinary disposition of the right subclavian artery as, lusus nature or sport of nature. Since then the term 'dysphagia lusoria ' has been used to refer to all aortic root anomalies causing oesophageal dysphagia.2 We report a case of dysphagia lusoria caused by a right aortic arch with a large diverticulum (diverticulum of Kommerell3) at the origin of an aberrant left subclavian artery. CASE REPORT A 45 year old lady presented with a 2 month history of fatigue, shortness of breath, and a feeling of tightness at the lower end Fig 2. Dysphagia due to an aberrant left subclavian artery in a right-sided aortic arch ofher sternum associated with occasional episodes of dysphagia. Physical examination was unremarkable. Her ECG was normal. A chest radiograph demonstrated a right sided aortic arch. A subsequent barium meal demonstrated an area of constriction in the upper third of the thoracic oesophagus with an indentation arising posteriorly causing compression and contrast hold up. (Fig 1). The indentation corresponded to the level of the aortic arch and the radiological appearances suggested this was due to an aberrant vessel. Echocardiography was normal but subsequent k~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~............</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7083-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7083_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:14:28">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3539DF54F9397EE30BA0671A1DF90762?doi=10.1.1.112.869&amp;rank=9</link><title>Optimal Aggregation Algorithms for Middleware</title><description>Optimal Aggregation Algorithms for Middleware

We are given a large database of customer transactions, where each transaction consists of customer-id, transaction time, and the items bought in the transaction. We introduce the problem of mining sequential patterns over such databases. We present three algorithms to solve this problem, and empirically evaluate their performance using synthetic data. Two of the proposed algorithms, AprioriSome and AprioriAll, have comparable performance, albeit AprioriSome performs a little better when the minimum number of customers that must support a sequential pattern is low. Scale-up experiments show that both AprioriSome and AprioriAll scale linearly with the number of customer transactions. They also have excellent scale-up properties with respect to the number of transactions per customer and the number of items in a transaction. 1 Introduction Database mining is motivated by the decision support problem faced by most large retail organizations.
