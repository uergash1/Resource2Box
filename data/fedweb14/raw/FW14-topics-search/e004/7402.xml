User errors cause or contribute to most computer security failures, yet user interfaces for security still tend to be clumsy, confusing, or near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques appropriate to other types of consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0. Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a laboratory user test to evaluate whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully used by cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic mail security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief description of our continuing work on the development and application of user interface design principles and techniques for security. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7402-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7402_02.html" timestamp="2014-05-23 00:00:27">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5A1E114D09CC53C68A07746CBC92DFB9?doi=10.1.1.206.5718&amp;rank=2</link><title>Teaching Johnny not to fall for phish</title><description>Teaching Johnny not to fall for phish

A person seeking someone else's attention is normally able to quickly assess how interruptible they are. This assessment allows for behavior we perceive as natural, socially appropriate, or simply polite. On the other hand, today's computer systems are almost entirely oblivious to the human world they operate in, and typically have no way to take into account the interruptibility of the user. This paper presents a Wizard of Oz study exploring whether, and how, robust sensor-based predictions of interruptibility might be constructed, which sensors might be most useful to such predictions, and how simple such sensors might be. The study simulates a range of possible sensors through human coding of audio and video recordings. Experience sampling is used to simultaneously collect randomly distributed self-reports of interruptibility. Based on these simulated sensors, we construct statistical models predicting human interruptibility and compare their predictions with the collected self-report data. The results of these models, although covering a demographically limited sample, are very promising, with the overall accuracy of several models reaching about 78%. Additionally, a model tuned to avoiding unwanted interruptions does so for 90% of its predictions, while retaining 75% overall accuracy.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7402-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7402_06.html" timestamp="2014-05-23 00:01:42">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5A1E114D09CC53C68A07746CBC92DFB9?doi=10.1.1.218.5708&amp;rank=6</link><title>Johnny Appleseed: Wardriving to Reduce Interference in Chaotic Wireless Deployments</title><description>Johnny Appleseed: Wardriving to Reduce Interference in Chaotic Wireless Deployments

Abstract—The adversarial element is an intrinsic part of the design of secure systems, but our assumptions about attackers and threat is often limited or stereotypical. Although there has been previous work on applying User-Centered Design on Persona development to build personas for possible attackers, such work is only speculative and fails to build upon recent research. This paper presents an approach for developing Attacker Personas which is both grounded and validated by structured data about attackers. We describe a case study example where the personas were developed and used to support the development of a Context of Use description for the EU FP7 webinos project.
