Abstract \- Cited by 1333 (62 self) \- Add to MetaCart

We argue that the random oracle model -- where all parties have access to a public random oracle -- provides a bridge between cryptographic theory and cryptographic practice. In the paradigm we suggest, a practical protocol P is produced by first devising and proving correct a protocol P R for the random oracle model, and then replacing oracle accesses by the computation of an "appropriately chosen" function h. This paradigm yields protocols much more efficient than standard ones while retaining many of the advantages of provable security. We illustrate these gains for problems including encryption, signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7152-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7152_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 15:59:55">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=321ABAA853CBE86BF8B8294259249AC9?doi=10.1.1.121.5868&amp;rank=4</link><title>Similarity search in high dimensions via hashing</title><description>Similarity search in high dimensions via hashing

We describe Freenet, an adaptive peer-to-peer network application that permits the publication, replication, and retrieval of data while protecting the anonymity of both authors and readers. Freenet operates as a network of identical nodes that collectively pool their storage space to store data files and cooperate to route requests to the most likely physical location of data. No broadcast search or centralized location index is employed. Files are referred to in a location-independent manner, and are dynamically replicated in locations near requestors and deleted from locations where there is no interest. It is infeasible to discover the true origin or destination of a file passing through the network, and difficult for a node operator to determine or be held responsible for the actual physical contents of her own node.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7152-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7152_06.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:00:37">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=321ABAA853CBE86BF8B8294259249AC9?doi=10.1.1.100.9674&amp;rank=6</link><title>Monads for functional programming</title><description>Monads for functional programming

The use of monads to structure functional programs is described. Monads provide a convenient framework for simulating effects found in other languages, such as global state, exception handling, output, or non-determinism. Three case studies are looked at in detail: how monads ease the modification of a simple evaluator; how monads act as the basis of a datatype of arrays subject to in-place update; and how monads can be used to build parsers.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7152-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7152_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:00:56">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=321ABAA853CBE86BF8B8294259249AC9?doi=10.1.1.107.1494&amp;rank=7</link><title>Short signatures from the Weil pairing</title><description>Short signatures from the Weil pairing

Abstract. We introduce a short signature scheme based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption on certain elliptic and hyper-elliptic curves. The signature length is half the size of a DSA signature for a similar level of security. Our short signature scheme is designed for systems where signatures are typed in by a human or signatures are sent over a low-bandwidth channel. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7152-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7152_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:01:19">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=321ABAA853CBE86BF8B8294259249AC9?doi=10.1.1.121.6177&amp;rank=8</link><title>A block-sorting lossless data compression algorithm</title><description>A block-sorting lossless data compression algorithm

The charter of SRC is to advance both the state of knowledge and the state of the art in computer systems. From our establishment in 1984, we have performed basic and applied research to support Digital’s business objectives. Our current work includes exploring distributed personal computing on multiple platforms, networking, programming technology, system modelling and management techniques, and selected applications. Our strategy is to test the technical and practical value of our ideas by building hardware and software prototypes and using them as daily tools. Interesting systems are too complex to be evaluated solely in the abstract; extended use allows us to investigate their properties in depth. This experience is useful in the short term in refining our designs, and invaluable in the long term in advancing our knowledge. Most of the major advances in information systems have come through this strategy, including personal computing, distributed systems, and the Internet. We also perform complementary work of a more mathematical flavor. Some of it is in established fields of theoretical computer science, such as the analysis of algorithms, computational geometry, and logics of programming. Other work explores new ground motivated by problems that arise in our systems research. We have a strong commitment to communicating our results; exposing and testing our ideas in the research and development communities leads to improved understanding. Our research report series supplements publication in professional journals and conferences. We seek users for our prototype systems among those with whom we have common interests, and we encourage collaboration with university researchers.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7152-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7152_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:01:40">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=321ABAA853CBE86BF8B8294259249AC9?doi=10.1.1.185.988&amp;rank=9</link><title>Pseudo-Random Generation from One-Way Functions</title><description>Pseudo-Random Generation from One-Way Functions

Pseudorandom generators are fundamental to many theoretical and applied aspects of computing. We show howto construct a pseudorandom generator from any oneway function. Since it is easy to construct a one-way function from a pseudorandom generator, this result shows that there is a pseudorandom generator iff there is a one-way function.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7152-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7152_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:02:02">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=321ABAA853CBE86BF8B8294259249AC9?doi=10.1.1.17.1073&amp;rank=10</link><title>The Sybil Attack</title><description>The Sybil Attack

Large-scale peer-to-peer systems face security threats from faulty or hostile remote computing elements. To resist these threats, many such systems employ redundancy. However, if a single faulty entity can present multiple identities, it can control a substantial fraction of the system, thereby undermining this redundancy. One approach to preventing these "Sybil attacks" is to have a trusted agency certify identities. This paper shows that, without a logically centralized authority, Sybil attacks are always possible except under extreme and unrealistic assumptions of resource parity and coordination among entities.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
