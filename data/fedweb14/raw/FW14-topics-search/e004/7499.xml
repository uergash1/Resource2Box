We exploit di®erences in early colonial experience to estimate the e®ect of institutions on economic performance. Our argument is that Europeans adopted very di®erent colonization policies in di®erent colonies, with di®erent associated institutions. The choice of colonization strategy was, at least in part, determined by the feasibility of whether Europeans could settle in the colony. In places where Europeans faced high mortality rates, they could not settle and they were more likely to set up worse (extractive) institutions. These early institutions persisted to the present. We document these hypotheses in the data. Exploiting di®erences in mortality rates faced by soldiers, bishops and sailors in the colonies during the 18th and 19th centuries as an instrument for current institutions, we estimate large e®ects of institutions on income per capita. Our estimates imply that a change from the worst (Zaire) to the best (US or New Zealand) institutions in our sample would be associated with a ¯ve fold increase in income per capita.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7499-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7499_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 02:18:40">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=30DCC3DDD8F26D3052B20BC1293E823E?doi=10.1.1.130.151&amp;rank=6</link><title>Applied Nonparametric Regression</title><description>Applied Nonparametric Regression

Abstract \- Cited by 15 (0 self) \- Add to MetaCart

Much attention has been devoted recently to the underground economy, and in particular to the IRC markets for stolen identities, phishing kits, botnets, and cybercrime related services. It is suggested that sophisticated underground markets show great specialization and maturity. There are complex divisions of labor and service offerings for every need. Stolen credentials are traded in bulk for pennies on the dollar. It is suggested that large sums move on these markets. We argue that this makes very little sense. Using basic arguments from economics we show that the IRC markets studied represent classic examples of lemon markets. The ever-present rippers who cheat other participants ensure that the market cannot operate effectively. Their presence represents a tax on every transaction. Those who form gangs and alliances avoid this tax, enjoy a lower cost basis and higher profit. This suggests a two tier underground economy where organization is the route to profit. The IRC markets appear to be the lower tier, and are occupied by those without skills or alliances, newcomers, and those who seek to cheat them. The goods offered for sale on these markets are those that are easy to acquire, but hard to monetize. We find that estimates of the size of the IRC markets are enormously exaggerated. Finally, we find that defenders recruit their own opponents by publicizing exaggerated estimates of the rewards of cybercrime. Those so recruited inhabit the lower tier; they produce very little profit, but contribute greatly to the externalities of cybercrime. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7499-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7499_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 02:22:56">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=30DCC3DDD8F26D3052B20BC1293E823E?doi=10.1.1.377.8969&amp;rank=9</link><title>Australian Dollars Exchange Rate and Gold Prices: An Interval Method Analysis</title><description>Australian Dollars Exchange Rate and Gold Prices: An Interval Method Analysis
