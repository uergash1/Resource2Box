Click is a new software architecture for building flexible and configurable routers. A Click router is assembled from packet processing modules called elements. Individual elements implement simple router functions like packet classification, queueing, scheduling, and interfacing with network devices. A router configuration is a directed graph with elements at the vertices; packets flow along the edges of the graph. Configurations are written in a declarative language that supports user-defined abstractions. This language is both readable by humans and easily manipulated by tools. We present language tools that optimize router configurations and ensure they satisfy simple invariants. Due to Click’s architecture and language, Click router configurations are modular and easy to extend. A standards-compliant Click IP router has sixteen elements on its forwarding path. We present extensions to this router that support dropping policies, fairness among flows, quality-of-service, and</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7085-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7085_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 03:07:56">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=64C02AB3FC5357D54A0AF255B4AFAF76?doi=10.1.1.78.8384&amp;rank=3</link><title>Evaluating collaborative filtering recommender systems</title><description>Evaluating collaborative filtering recommender systems

As we draw near to closing out the twentieth century, we see quite clearly that the information-processing and telecommunications revolutions now underway will continue vigorously into the twenty-first. We interact and transact by directing flocks of digital packets towards each other through cyberspace, carrying love notes, digital cash, and secret corporate documents. Our personal and economic lives rely more and more on our ability to let such ethereal carrier pigeons mediate at a distance what we used to do with face-to-face meetings, paper documents, and a firm handshake. Unfortunately, the technical wizardry enabling remote collaborations is founded on broadcasting everything as sequences of zeros and ones that one's own dog wouldn't recognize. What is to distinguish a digital dollar when it is as easily reproducible as the spoken word? How do we converse privately when every syllable is bounced off a satellite and smeared over an entire continent? How should a bank know that it really is Bill Gates requesting from his laptop in Fiji a transfer of $10,000,000,000 to another bank? Fortunately, the magical mathematics of cryptography can help. Cryptography provides techniques for keeping information secret, for determining that information</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7085-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7085_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 03:10:13">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=64C02AB3FC5357D54A0AF255B4AFAF76?doi=10.1.1.421.55&amp;rank=5</link><title>Convex Analysis</title><description>Convex Analysis

In this book we aim to present, in a unified framework, a broad spectrum of mathematical theory that has grown in connection with the study of problems of optimization, equilibrium, control, and stability of linear and nonlinear systems. The title Variational Analysis reflects this breadth. For a long time, ‘variational ’ problems have been identified mostly with the ‘calculus of variations’. In that venerable subject, built around the minimization of integral functionals, constraints were relatively simple and much of the focus was on infinite-dimensional function spaces. A major theme was the exploration of variations around a point, within the bounds imposed by the constraints, in order to help characterize solutions and portray them in terms of ‘variational principles’. Notions of perturbation, approximation and even generalized differentiability were extensively investigated. Variational theory progressed also to the study of so-called stationary points, critical points, and other indications of singularity that a point might have relative to its neighbors, especially in association with existence theorems for differential equations.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7085-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7085_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 03:11:13">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=64C02AB3FC5357D54A0AF255B4AFAF76?doi=10.1.1.12.6173&amp;rank=6</link><title>Free Riding on Gnutella</title><description>Free Riding on Gnutella

this paper, Gnutella is no exception to this finding, and an experimental study of its user patterns shows indeed that free riding is the norm rather than the exception. If distributed systems such as Gnutella rely on voluntary cooperation, rampant free riding may eventually render them useless, as few individuals will contribute anything that is new and high quality. Thus, the current debate over copyright might become a non-issue when compared to the possible collapse of such systems. This collapse can happen because of two factors, the tragedy of the digital commons, and increased system vulnerability, which we now discuss</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7085-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7085_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 03:12:13">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=64C02AB3FC5357D54A0AF255B4AFAF76?doi=10.1.1.20.7003&amp;rank=7</link><title>Towards a Standard Upper Ontology</title><description>Towards a Standard Upper Ontology

The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) is an upper level ontology that has been proposed as a starter document for The Standard Upper Ontology Working Group, an IEEE-sanctioned working group of collaborators from the fields of engineering, philosophy, and information science. The SUMO provides definitions for general-purpose terms and acts as a foundation for more specific domain ontologies. In this paper we outline the strategy used to create the current version of the SUMO, discuss some of the challenges that we faced in constructing the ontology, and describe in detail its most general concepts and the relations between them.

Abstract \- Cited by 339 (1 self) \- Add to MetaCart

Napster pioneered the idea of peer-to-peer file sharing, and supported it with a centralized file search facility. Subsequent P2P systems like Gnutella adopted decentralized search algorithms. However, Gnutella's notoriously poor scaling led some to propose distributed hash table solutions to the wide-area file search problem. Contrary to that trend, we advocate retaining Gnutella's simplicity while proposing new mechanisms that greatly improve its scalability. Building upon prior research [1, 12, 22], we propose several modifications to Gnutella's design that dynamically adapt the overlay topology and the search algorithms in order to accommodate the natural heterogeneity present in most peer-to-peer systems. We test our design through simulations and the results show three to five orders of magnitude improvement in total system capacity. We also report on a prototype implementation and its deployment on a testbed.

This paper is an attempt to test the hypothesis that utility depends on income relative to a 'comparison' or reference level. Using data on 5,000 British workers, it provides two findings. First, workers' reported satisfaction levels are shown to be inversely related to their comparison wage rates. Second, holding income constant, satisfaction levels are shown to be strongly declining in the level of education. More generally, the paper tries to help begin the task of constructing an economics of job satisfaction.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
