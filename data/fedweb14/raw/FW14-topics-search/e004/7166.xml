Much of the research taking place in the field called "electronic publishing" would perhaps be better called "electronic printing" or "electronic typography" or "electronic drawing" or "electronic file cabinets". The word "publishing" has traditionally meant "to make generally known" or "to disseminate". In December 1985 I began a venture in true electronic publishing, "true" in the sense that its primary goals were to explore electronic dissemination rather than electronic typesetting or formatting. I wanted to start a periodical that could be distributed electronically, that would use computers for every aspect of its production and distribution process, that would be on a topic of wide enough interest that I could get subscribers in as many countries as possible, and that was on a topic that I would find sufficiently interesting to be able to maintain interest in it long enough to get substantial experience. The obvious topic was cookery. I began a weekly magazine whose contents are...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7166-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7166_03.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:46:19">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F4951A60C0869519A339BB085BBA0DB?doi=10.1.1.371.5794&amp;rank=3</link><title>Supplies Needed</title><description>Supplies Needed

Snacks can be an important part of a healthful diet. Well-chosen snacks can help you manage your weight, hunger, health, and energy. Snacks can help you gain or lose weight. Energy dense snacks can help you eat more in a day for weight gain. Eating several small healthy snacks between meals helps with weight loss by keeping cravings down and preventing excessive hunger that may lead to overeating. Snacks can help you meet healthful guidelines for grain, vegetable, fruit, calcium and protein intake. Snacks keep you going when you are dragging- and nutritious snacks keep you going longer. Small, wisely chosen snacks between meals promote good health and add pleasure to life. Snack with variety, balance and moderation in mind. The following tips can make between-meal eating a nutritious, enjoyable part of your eating style! Work snacks into your diet – Rather than considering them as &amp;amp;quot;extras, &amp;amp;quot; choose snacks that contribute to your calorie and nutrient needs. Snack on foods that compliment your meals and add variety to your diet. For instance, if you mainly eat meats and starch at meals, snack on fruits, vegetables, and milk, cheese, or yogurt. Match snacks to your calorie needs and weight goals – If your goal is weight maintenance or weight loss, you may want to consume nutrient dense snacks that are between 100-200 calories. If you are a physically active person, however, or a person looking to gain weight, you may need to consume nutrient dense snacks that contain between 200-400 calories.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7166-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7166_05.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:46:57">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F4951A60C0869519A339BB085BBA0DB?doi=10.1.1.15.2326&amp;rank=5</link><title>Electronic Publishing, Vol . 1(1), 55--76 (april 1988)</title><description>Electronic Publishing, Vol . 1(1), 55--76 (april 1988)

We develop a grammar for Urdu in Grammatical Framework (GF). GF is a programming language for defining multilingual grammar applications. GF resource grammar library currently supports 16 languages. These grammars follow an Interlingua approach and consist of morphology and syntax modules that cover a wide range of features of a language. In this paper we explore different syntactic features of the Urdu language, and show how to fit them in the multilingual framework of GF. We also discuss how we cover some of the distinguishing features of Urdu such as, ergativity in verb agreement (see Sec 4.2). The main purpose of GF resource grammar library is to provide an easy way to write natural language applications without knowing the details of syntax, morphology and lexicon. To demonstrate it, we use Urdu resource grammar to add support for Urdu in the work reported in (Angelov and Ranta, 2010) which is an implementation of</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7166-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7166_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:47:53">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F4951A60C0869519A339BB085BBA0DB?doi=10.1.1.165.7272&amp;rank=8</link><title>Food Habits and Their Relationship to Dietary Guidelines</title><description>Food Habits and Their Relationship to Dietary Guidelines

Turkey. Although the cuisines of these countries are similar, each culture has distinctly different eating practices, food preferences, and food preparation techniques. Thousands of Middle Easterners live in the United States. Middle Easterners emigrate for political reasons, advanced schooling, and because of the prior emigration of other family members. The many students and professionals who emigrate from these countries often come from affluent families and are cosmopolitan in their food habits. As with other immigrant groups, the length of stay in the United States correlates with the degree of Americanization of the diet. Traditional dishes tend to be prepared and eaten for special occasions.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7166-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7166_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:48:11">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F4951A60C0869519A339BB085BBA0DB?doi=10.1.1.135.3944&amp;rank=9</link><title>Blogging as Participation: The Active Sociality of a New Literacy.

Introduction: A note on ‘new ’ literacies In current work we are theorising the idea of ‘new ’ literacies along ontological lines (Lankshear and Knobel 2006 forthcoming). We argue that certain literacies can be identified as ‘new ’ in a historically significant sense to the extent that they are constituted by what we call ‘new technical stuff ’ and ‘new ethos stuff’.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7166-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7166_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:48:30">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1F4951A60C0869519A339BB085BBA0DB?doi=10.1.1.194.9993&amp;rank=10</link><title>Smart Nutrition The BALANCE Bar Company has always been dedicated to helping people lead healthier lives.

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

BALANCE Bar is founded on the 40-30-30 nutrition philosophy based on a smart ratio of carbohydrate, protein, and dietary fat (40 % of calories from carbohydrate, 30 % from protein and dietary fat). The 40-30-30 plan is a diet rich in protein with moderate carbohydrates. It is an easy, enjoyable way of eating. For instance, instead of grabbing a bag of potato chips, try some whole-wheat crackers topped with reduced fat cheese and apple slices. Not only will it help get you through the day, it packs more nutrition! NUTRITIOUS Preliminary evidence suggests there are key benefits from following a protein-rich, moderate carbohydrate eating plan, like 40-30-30. BALANCE Bar’s 40-30-30 eating plan includes a variety of foods and is rich in vitamins, minerals and fiber. This plan is very different from some other high-protein diets which tend to be higher in fat and restrict certain food groups, and therefore are potentially low in key nutrients like calcium, folate, vitamin E and fiber. 1 STAYING POWER A protein-rich, moderate carbohydrate eating plan like 40-30-30, may increase feelings of fullness. 2,3 This means your meals have “staying power ” to help you concentrate on what you need to do… not your hunger.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
