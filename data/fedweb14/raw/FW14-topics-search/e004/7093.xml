Abstract \- Cited by 998 (7 self) \- Add to MetaCart

This paper considers a firm that must issue common stock to raise cash to undertake a valuable investment opportunity. Management is assumed to know more about the firm’s value than potential investors. Investors interpret the firm’s actions rationally. An. equilibrium mode1 of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The mode1 shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required. Extensions and applications of the model are discussed. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7093-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7093_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:26:35">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5952E76A94D4FEB90A7F3D9BBD83021A?doi=10.1.1.1.3369&amp;rank=4</link><title>Optimization Flow Control, I: Basic Algorithm and Convergence</title><description>Optimization Flow Control, I: Basic Algorithm and Convergence

Abstract \- Cited by 518 (55 self) \- Add to MetaCart

We propose an optimization approach to flow control where the objective is to maximize the aggregate source utility over their transmission rates. We view network links and sources as processors of a distributed computation system to solve the dual problem using gradient projection algorithm. In this system sources select transmission rates that maximize their own benefits, utility minus bandwidth cost, and network links adjust bandwidth prices to coordinate the sources' decisions. We allow feedback delays to be different, substantial and time-varying, and links and sources to update at different times and with different frequencies. We provide asynchronous distributed algorithms and prove their convergence in a static environment. We present measurements obtained from a preliminary prototype to illustrate the convergence of the algorithm in a slowly time-varying environment.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7093-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7093_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:27:49">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5952E76A94D4FEB90A7F3D9BBD83021A?doi=10.1.1.139.1006&amp;rank=5</link><title>Base-calling of automated sequencer traces using phred.
