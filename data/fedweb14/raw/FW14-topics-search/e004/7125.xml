: Reasoning about knowledge seems to play a fundamental role in distributed systems. Indeed, such reasoning is a central part of the informal intuitive arguments used in the design of distributed protocols. Communication in a distributed system can be viewed as the act of transforming the system's state of knowledge. This paper presents a general framework for formalizing and reasoning about knowledge in distributed systems. We argue that states of knowledge of groups of processors are useful concepts for the design and analysis of distributed protocols. In particular, distributed knowledge corresponds to knowledge that is "distributed" among the members of the group, while common knowledge corresponds to a fact being "publicly known". The relationship between common knowledge and a variety of desirable actions in a distributed system is illustrated. Furthermore, it is shown that, formally speaking, in practical systems common knowledge cannot be attained. A number of weaker variants...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7125-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7125_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:40:02">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=FE1793377586EDF305D59338ED085444?doi=10.1.1.212.5185&amp;rank=4</link><title>Using information content to evaluate semantic similarity in a taxonomy</title><description>Using information content to evaluate semantic similarity in a taxonomy

philip.resnikfleast.sun.com This paper presents a new measure of semantic similarity in an IS-A taxonomy, based on the notion of information content. Experimental evaluation suggests that the measure performs encouragingly well (a correlation of r = 0.79 with a benchmark set of human similarity judgments, with an upper bound of r = 0.90 for human subjects performing the same task), and significantly better than the traditional edge counting approach (r = 0.66). 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7125-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7125_05.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:40:21">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=FE1793377586EDF305D59338ED085444?doi=10.1.1.18.2720&amp;rank=5</link><title>Data Clustering: A Review</title><description>Data Clustering: A Review

Clustering is the unsupervised classification of patterns (observations, data items, or feature vectors) into groups (clusters). The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and information retrieval.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7125-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7125_06.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:40:43">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=FE1793377586EDF305D59338ED085444?doi=10.1.1.149.3392&amp;rank=6</link><title>Basic objects in natural categories</title><description>Basic objects in natural categories

Within the past decade, significant effort has occurred in developing methods of facial expression analysis. Because most investigators have used relatively limited data sets, the generalizability of these various methods remains unknown. We describe the problem space for facial expression analysis, which includes level of description, transitions among expression, eliciting conditions, reliability and validity of training and test data, individual differences in subjects, head orientation and scene complexity, image characteristics, and relation to non-verbal behavior. We then present the CMU-Pittsburgh AU-Coded Face Expression Image Database, which currently includes 2105 digitized image sequences from 182 adult subjects of varying ethnicity, performing multiple tokens of most primary FACS action units. This database is the most comprehensive test-bed to date for comparative studies of facial expression analysis. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7125-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7125_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:42:02">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=FE1793377586EDF305D59338ED085444?doi=10.1.1.211.3546&amp;rank=10</link><title>Eye movements in reading and information processing: 20 years of research</title><description>Eye movements in reading and information processing: 20 years of research

Recent studies of eye movements in reading and other information processing tasks, such as music reading, typing, visual search, and scene perception, are reviewed. The major emphasis of the review is on reading as a specific example of cognitive processing. Basic topics discussed with respect to reading are (a) the characteristics of eye movements, (b) the perceptual span, (c) integration of information across saccades, (d) eye movement control, and (e) individual differences (including dyslexia). Similar topics are discussed with respect to the other tasks examined. The basic theme of the review is that eye movement data reflect moment-to-moment cognitive processes in the various tasks examined. Theoretical and practical considerations concerning the use of eye movement data are also discussed. Many studies using eye movements to investigate cognitive processes have appeared over the past 20 years. In an earlier review, I (Rayner, 1978b) argued that since the mid-1970s we have been in a third era of eye movement research and that the success of research in the current era would depend on the ingenuity of researchers in designing interesting and informative</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
