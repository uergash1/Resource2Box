We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7405-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7405_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 19:04:37">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=E7049343CFC8A2F21E5E2FAFFC30E9CC?doi=10.1.1.4.1857&amp;rank=2</link><title>Full-Spectrum Polarized Lighting: An Option for Light Therapy Boxes</title><description>Full-Spectrum Polarized Lighting: An Option for Light Therapy Boxes

Summary.-The term apoptosis is proposed for a hitherto little recognized mechanism of controlled cell deletion, which appears to play a complementary but opposite role to mitosis in the regulation of animal cell populations. Its morphological features suggest that it is an active, inherently programmed phenomenon, and it has been shown that it can be initiated or inhibited by a variety of environmental stimuli, both physiological and pathological. The structural changes take place in two discrete stages. The first comprises nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation and breaking up of the cell into a number of membrane-bound, ultrastructurally well-preserved fragments. In the second stage these apoptotic bodies are shed from epithelial-lined surfaces or are taken up by other cells, where they undergo a series of changes resembling in vitro autolysis within phagosomes, and are rapidly degraded by lysosomal enzymes derived from the ingesting cells. Apoptosis seems to be involved in cell turnover in many healthy adult tissues and is responsible for focal elimination of cells during normal embryonic development. It occurs spontaneously in untreated malignant neoplasms, and participates in at least some types of therapeutically induced tumour regression. It is implicated in both physiological involution and atrophy of various tissues and organs. It can also be triggered by noxious agents, both in the embryo and adult animal. IN recent years it has become widely recognized that spontaneous loss of cells is an important parameter in neoplastic</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7405-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7405_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 19:07:31">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=E7049343CFC8A2F21E5E2FAFFC30E9CC?doi=10.1.1.130.1077&amp;rank=6</link><title>An Investigation of the Therac-25 Accidents</title><description>An Investigation of the Therac-25 Accidents

The specificities of 28 commercially available compounds reported to be relatively selective inhibitors of particular serine� threonine-specific protein kinases have been examined against a large panel of protein kinases. The compounds KT 5720, Rottlerin and quercetin were found to inhibit many protein kinases, sometimes much more potently than their presumed targets, and conclusions drawn from their use in cell-based experiments are likely to be erroneous. Ro 318220 and related bisindoylmaleimides, as well as H89, HA1077 and Y 27632, were more selective inhibitors, but still inhibited two or more protein kinases with similar potency. LY 294002 was found to inhibit casein kinase-2 with similar potency to phosphoinositide (phosphatidylinositol) 3-kinase.

LifeLines provide a general visualization environment for personal histories that can be applied to medical and court records, professional histories and other types of biographical data. A one screen overview shows multiple facets of the records. Aspects, for example medical conditions or legal cases, are displayed as individual time lines, while icons indicate discrete events, such as physician consultations or legal reviews. Line color and thickness illustrate relationships or significance, rescaling tools and filters allow users to focus on part of the information. LifeLines reduce the chances of missing information, facilitate spotting anomalies and trends, streamline access to details, while remaining tailorable and easily transferable between applications. The paper describes the use of LifeLines for youth records of the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice and also for medical records. User's feedback was collected using a Visual Basic prototype for the youth record.

The Protg project has come a long way since Mark Musen first built the Protg metatool for knowledge-based systems in 1987. The original tool was a small application, aimed at building knowledge-acquisition tools for a few specialized programs in medical planning. From this initial tool, the Protg system has evolved into a durable, extensible platform for knowledge-based systems development and research. The current version, Protg-2000, can be run on a variety of platforms, supports customized user-interface extensions, incorporates the Open Knowledge Base Connectivity (OKBC) knowledge model, interacts with standard storage formats such as relational databases, XML, and RDF, and has been used by hundreds of individuals and research groups. In this paper, we follow the evolution of the Protg project through 3 distinct re-implementations. We describe our overall methodology, our design decisions, and the lessons we have learned over the duration of the project.. We believe that our success is one of infrastructure: Protg is a flexible, well-supported, and robust development environment. Using Protg, developers and domain experts can easily build effective knowledge-based systems, and researchers can explore ideas in a variety of knowledge-based domains.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
