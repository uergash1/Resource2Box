An increasing number of systems, from pay-TV to electronic purses, rely on the tamper resistance of smartcards and other security processors. We describe a number of attacks on such systems -- some old, some new and some that are simply little known outside the chip testing community. We conclude that trusting tamper resistance is problematic; smartcards are broken routinely, and even a device that was described by a government signals agency as `the most secure processor generally available' turns out to be vulnerable. Designers of secure systems should consider the consequences with care.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7168-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7168_02.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:52:15">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=87B5FF0DAFE5166FEE7CDC25869BE75F?doi=10.1.1.374.8291&amp;rank=2</link><title>Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET): Routing Protocol Performance Issues and Evaluation Considerations", RFC 2501</title><description>Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET): Routing Protocol Performance Issues and Evaluation Considerations", RFC 2501

Separation of concerns or aspects is nowadays recognized as an important issue in software engineering, both at the programming and at the design/specification level. The goal of mixed specification languages (e.g. SDL, value-passing process algebras such as extensions of CSP or full-LOTOS, Korrigan) is to take into account all - or at least several - aspects of systems. We found out from our experience that a lot of mixed specification languages do share most of their features. However, specific theories, such as the symbolic transition systems one, still have to be studied for several families of mixed specification languages. In this paper we propose a logic with an expressive temporal gluing mechanism. This logic aims at providing an abstract denotational semantics for mixed specification languages. This logic enables one to reason about mixed specifications at a high level, without targeting a specific model or language. We show how our logic can be seen as an institution, which has the benefits of enabling a common refinement theory for mixed specification languages.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7168-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7168_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:53:45">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=87B5FF0DAFE5166FEE7CDC25869BE75F?doi=10.1.1.411.5725&amp;rank=7</link><title>SPEAR3 GRADIENT DIPOLE CORE FABRICATION</title><description>SPEAR3 GRADIENT DIPOLE CORE FABRICATION

Alewife is a multiprocessor architecture that supports up to 512 processing nodes connected over a scalable and cost-effective mesh network at a constant cost per node. The MIT Alewife machine, a prototype implementation of the architecture, demonstrates that a parallel system can be both scalable and programmable. Four mechanisms combine to achieve these goals: software-extended coherent shared memory provides a global, linear address space; integrated message passing allows compiler and operating system designers to provide efficient communication and synchronization; support for fine-grain computation allows many processorsto cooperate on small problem sizes; and latency tolerance mechanisms -- including block multithreading and prefetching -- mask unavoidable delays due to communication; Microbenchmarks, together with over a dozen complete applications running on the 32-node prototype, help analyze the behavior of the system. Analysis shows that integrating message passing with sha...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7168-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7168_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:54:22">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=87B5FF0DAFE5166FEE7CDC25869BE75F?doi=10.1.1.225.6558&amp;rank=9</link><title>Synthesis of Glue Logic, Transactors, Multiplexors and Serialisors from Protocol Specifications.</title><description>Synthesis of Glue Logic, Transactors, Multiplexors and Serialisors from Protocol Specifications.
