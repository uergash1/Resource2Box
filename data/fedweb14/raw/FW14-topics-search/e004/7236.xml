Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

During the past 3 decades, chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors have been extensively evaluated in a myriad of schedules, doses, and combinations. Remarkable advances in outcome have been achieved for certain children, notably those with medulloblastoma, but with a high cost to quality of life. In addition, the success achieved for medulloblastoma is offset by lack of progress for high-grade glioma. Despite intensive investigation, no single chemotherapeutic regimen stands out for children with high-grade glioma, with most succumbing to their disease. Further treatment intensification using conventional nonspecific chemotherapy is more likely to result in additional toxicity without major advances in survival. Genomewide analysis using microarray technology has contributed significantly to our understanding of tumor biology, shifting the focus onto novel agents that target molecular changes crucial for tumor proliferation or survival. These selective agents are likely to be less toxic to normal cells and more effective.

Abstract: The prognosis of patients diagnosed with malignant glioma (MG) remains poor. However, recent advances in neuro-oncology allowing a better understanding of this particular disease have allowed the development of new therapeutics. Many molecular genetic and signal transduction pathway targets have been identified that are now being investigated. Novel locoregional treatments, as well as strategies to improve regional delivery, are being evaluated. Studies of combinations of these approaches are also underway. In this review, we will discuss the current and future therapies under evaluation for the treatment of malignant gliomas.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
