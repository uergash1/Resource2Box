Abstract Several common systems satisfy some but not all of the VR This paper describes the CAVE (CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment) virtual reality/scientific visualization system in detail and demonstrates that projection technology applied to virtual-reality goals achieves a system that matches the quality of workstation screens in terms of resolution, color, and flicker-free stereo. In addition, this format helps reduce the effect of common tracking and system latency errors. The off-axis perspective projection techniques we use are shown to be simple and straightforward. Our techniques for doing multi-screen stereo vision are enumerated, and design barriers, past and current, are described. Advantages and disadvantages of the projection paradigm are discussed, with an analysis of the effect of tracking noise and delay on the user. Successive refinement, a necessary tool for scientific visualization, is developed in the virtual reality context.

In this work, we investigate the visual appearance of real-world surfaces and the dependence of appearance on scale, viewing direction and illumination direction. At ne scale, surface variations cause local intensity variation or image texture. The appearance of this texture depends on both illumination and viewing direction and can be characterized by the BTF (bidirectional texture function). At su ciently coarse scale, local image texture is not resolvable and local image intensity is uniform. The dependence of this image intensity on illumination and viewing direction is described by the BRDF (bidirectional re ectance distribution function). We simultaneously measure the BTF and BRDF of over 60 di erent rough surfaces, each observed with over 200 di erent combinations of viewing and illumination direction. The resulting BTF database is comprised of over 12,000 image textures. To enable convenient use of the BRDF measurements, we t the measurements to two recent models and obtain a BRDF parameter database. These parameters can be used directly in image analysis and synthesis of a wide variety of surfaces. The BTF, BRDF, and BRDF parameter databases have important implications for computer vision and computer graphics and and each is made publicly available.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7235-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7235_03.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 19:44:01">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=98855D340F758110FEC89B6A6E738EE9?doi=10.1.1.125.8443&amp;rank=3</link><title>Real-time american sign language recognition using desk and wearable computer based video</title><description>Real-time american sign language recognition using desk and wearable computer based video

We present two real-time hidden Markov model-based systems for recognizing sentence-level continuous American Sign Language (ASL) using a single camera to track the user’s unadorned hands. The first system observes the user from a desk mounted camera and achieves 92 percent word accuracy. The second system mounts the camera in a cap worn by the user and achieves 98 percent accuracy (97 percent with an unrestricted grammar). Both experiments use a 40-word lexicon.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7235-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7235_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 19:44:21">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=98855D340F758110FEC89B6A6E738EE9?doi=10.1.1.23.7000&amp;rank=4</link><title>Tamper Resistance -- a Cautionary Note</title><description>Tamper Resistance -- a Cautionary Note

An increasing number of systems, from pay-TV to electronic purses, rely on the tamper resistance of smartcards and other security processors. We describe a number of attacks on such systems -- some old, some new and some that are simply little known outside the chip testing community. We conclude that trusting tamper resistance is problematic; smartcards are broken routinely, and even a device that was described by a government signals agency as `the most secure processor generally available' turns out to be vulnerable. Designers of secure systems should consider the consequences with care.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7235-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7235_05.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 19:44:42">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=98855D340F758110FEC89B6A6E738EE9?doi=10.1.1.7.7401&amp;rank=5</link><title>Roof Integrated Solar</title><description>Roof Integrated Solar

Under the three-year Video Surveillance and Monitoring (VSAM) project (1997--1999), the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Sarnoff Corporation developed a system for autonomous Video Surveillance and Monitoring. The technical approach uses multiple, cooperative video sensors to provide continuous coverage of people and vehicles in a cluttered environment. This final report presents an overview of the system, and of the technical accomplishments that have been achieved. c fl2000 Carnegie Mellon University This work was funded by the DARPA Image Understanding under contract DAAB07-97-C-J031, and by the Office of Naval Research under grant N00014-99-1-0646. 1 Introduction The thrust of CMU research under the DARPA Video Surveillance and Monitoring (VSAM) project is cooperative multi-sensor surveillance to support battlefield awareness [17].

Amorphous computing is the development of organizational principles and programming languages for obtaining coherent behavior from the cooperation of myriads of unreliable parts that are interconnected in unknown, irregular, and time-varying ways. The impetus for amorphous computing comes from developments in microfabrication and fundamental biology, each of which is the basis of a kernel technology that makes it possible to build or grow huge numbers of almost-identical information-processing units at almost no cost. This paper sets out a research agenda for realizing the potential of amorphous computing and surveys some initial progress, both in programming and in fabrication. We describe some approaches to programming amorphous systems, which are inspired by metaphors from biology and physics. We also present the basic ideas of cellular computing, an approach to constructing digital-logic circuits within living cells by representing logic levels by concentrations DNA-bin...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
