The Sketchpad system uses drawing as a novel communication medium for a computer. The system contains input, output, and computation programs which enable it to interpret information drawn directly on a computer display. It has been used to draw electrical, mechanical, scientific, mathematical, and animated drawings; it is a general purpose system. Sketchpad has shown the most usefulness as an aid to the understanding of processes, such as the notion of linkages, which can be described with pictures. Sketchpad also makes it easy to draw highly repetitive or highly accurate drawings and to change drawings previously drawn with it. The many drawings in this thesis were all made with Sketchpad.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7121-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7121_02.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:28:05">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5FD3CE78FDAAF2A855575999E52B5839?doi=10.1.1.32.420&amp;rank=2</link><title>Monotone Complexity</title><description>Monotone Complexity
