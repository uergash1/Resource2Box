To date, realistic ISP topologies have not been accessible to the research community, leaving work that depends on topology on an uncertain footing. In this paper, we present new Internet mapping techniques that have enabled us to directly measure router-level ISP topologies. Our techniques reduce the number of required traces compared to a brute-force, all-to-all approach by three orders of magnitude without a significant loss in accuracy. They include the use of BGP routing tables to focus the measurements, exploiting properties of IP routing to eliminate redundant measurements, better alias resolution, and the use of DNS to divide each map into POPs and backbone. We collect maps from ten diverse ISPs using our techniques, and find that our maps are substantially more complete than those of earlier Internet mapping efforts. We also report on properties of these maps, including the size of POPs, distribution of router outdegree, and the inter-domain peering structure. As part of this work, we release our maps to the community.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7110-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7110_03.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:19:11">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CA2F314F8E341A4EEDAF2D8B7FC8D8DD?doi=10.1.1.123.8593&amp;rank=3</link><title>Proof-Carrying Code</title><description>Proof-Carrying Code

This paper describes proof-carrying code (PCC), a mechanism by which a host system can determine with certainty thatitissafetoexecute a program supplied (possibly in binary form) by anuntrusted source. For this to be possible, the untrusted code producer must supply with the code a safety proof that attests to the code's adherence to a previously de ned safety policy. The host can then easily and quickly validate the proof without using cryptography and without consulting any external agents. In order to gain preliminary experience with PCC, we have performed several case studies. We showinthis paper how proof-carrying code mightbeusedtodevelop safe assembly-language extensions of ML programs. In the context of this case study, we present and prove the adequacy of concrete representations for the safety policy, the safety proofs, and the proof validation. Finally, we brie y discuss how we use proof-carrying code to develop network packet lters that are faster than similar lters developed using other techniques and are formally guaranteed to be safe with respect to a given operating system safety policy.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7110-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7110_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:19:25">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CA2F314F8E341A4EEDAF2D8B7FC8D8DD?doi=10.1.1.366.8570&amp;rank=4</link><title>Problems in Computational Geometry</title><description>Problems in Computational Geometry
