I propose a network/search view of international trade in differentiated products. I present evidence that supports the view that proximity and common language/colonial ties are more important for differentiated products than for products traded on organized exchanges in matching international buyers and sellers, and that search barriers to trade are higher for differentiated than for homogeneous products.

to review the basis of common understanding between the various disciplines. In my estimate, the most fundamental contribution so far of artificial intelligence and computer science to the joint enterprise of cognitive science has been the notion of a physical symbol system, i.e., the concept of D broad class of systems capable of having and manipulating symbois, yet realizable in the physical universe. The notion of symbol so defined is internal to this concept, so it becomes a hypothesis that this notion of symbols includes the symbols that we humans use every day of our lives. In this paper we attempt systematically, but plainly, to lay out the nature of physical symbol systems. Such IJ review is in ways familiar, but not thereby useless. Restatement of fundamentals is an important exercise. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7126-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7126_06.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:43:41">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=F3455B93DF11ACE232393EB74CCA50EE?doi=10.1.1.106.52&amp;rank=6</link><title>Lyrically: automatic synchronization of acoustic musical signals and textual lyrics</title><description>Lyrically: automatic synchronization of acoustic musical signals and textual lyrics

Mental accounting is the set of cognitive operations used by individuals and households to organize, evaluate, and keep track of financial activities. Making use of research on this topic over the past decade, this paper summarizes the current state of our knowledge about how people engage in mental accounting activities. Three components of mental accounting receive the most attention. This first captures how outcomes are perceived and experienced, and how decisions are made and subsequently evaluated. The accounting system provides the inputs to be both ex ante and ex post cost-benefit analyses. A second component of mental accounting involves the assignment of activities to specific accounts. Both the sources and uses of funds are labeled in real as well as in mental accounting systems. Expenditures are grouped into categories (housing, food, etc.) and spending is sometimes constrained by implicit or explicit budgets. The third component of mental accounting concerns the frequency with which accounts are evaluated and 'choice bracketing'. Accounts can be balanced daily,</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7126-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7126_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:44:07">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=F3455B93DF11ACE232393EB74CCA50EE?doi=10.1.1.248.3654&amp;rank=8</link><title>Automatic Generation of Melodic Accompaniments for Lyrics</title><description>Automatic Generation of Melodic Accompaniments for Lyrics
