Abstract \- Cited by 15 (4 self) \- Add to MetaCart

A method is presented that uses b-strand interactions to predict the parallel right-handed b-helix super-secondary structural motif in protein sequences. A program called BetaWrap implements this method and is shown to score known b-helices above non-b-helices in the Protein Data Bank in cross-validation. It is demonstrated that BetaWrap learns each of the seven known SCOP b-helix families, when trained primarily on b-structures that are not b-helices, together with structural features of known b-helices from outside the family. BetaWrap also predicts many bacterial proteins of unknown structure to be b-helices; in particular, these proteins serve as virulence factors, adhesins, and toxins in bacterial pathogenesis and include cell surface proteins from Chlamydia and the intestinal bacterium Helicobacter pylori. The computational method used here may generalize to other b-structures for which strand topology and pro � les of residue accessibility are well conserved. Key words: parallel right-handed beta helix, protein folding, protein motif recognition, statistical prediction, bacterial pathogenesis.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7087-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7087_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 03:30:07">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=0DD5FB26804A8444CF8724D8A6F06ACB?doi=10.1.1.422.8273&amp;rank=3</link><title>awarded ARSC’s Lifetime Achievement and Distinguished</title><description>awarded ARSC’s Lifetime Achievement and Distinguished

Early in 2013 we launch Experiencing Jazz, Second Edition, by Rick Lawn. We are pleased with our contribution to the study of Jazz History. For the Foundations course we have a second edition of Music Fundamentals: A Balanced Approach, by Sumy Takesue. These publish later in the year. We continue to seek out textbooks for the music technology and music business curricula, and the Taylor and Francis acquisition of Focal Press contributes even more to that endeavour.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7087-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7087_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 03:36:48">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=0DD5FB26804A8444CF8724D8A6F06ACB?doi=10.1.1.422.9380&amp;rank=9</link><title>Victorians and their Music Machines in Milwaukee</title><description>Victorians and their Music Machines in Milwaukee

their Music Machines, ” and during our Saturday visit to Jasper Sanfilippo’s legendary Victorian Palace we’ll be delving deep into the wonderful world of automatic musical instruments. Not only will we get to see and hear the finest collection of these devices in existence, an experience that beggars description, but—under the expert guidance of curator Robert Ridgeway—we’ll be touching on everything from the restoration of these magnificent machines and the preservation of the media they play to the strategies used for recording performances on the Sanfilippo Wurlitzer, the world’s largest theater pipe organ. We’ll also be hearing from Helmut Kowar of the Vienna Phonogrammarchiv on the challenges of using sound recording to document musical automata, and from Philip Carli on the Orchestrion in the foyer of Jasper Sanfilippo’s Victorian Palace in Barrington Hill, Illinois. orchestrions owned and enjoyed by wealthy industrialists in Pittsburgh a century ago. Our host, the Ward Irish Music Archives, is generously treating us to a pair of presentations on American Irish music recording by authorities Mick Moloney and Harry Bradshaw.
