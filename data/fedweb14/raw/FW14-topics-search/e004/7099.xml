*Author to whom proofs and correspondence should be sentRegional Differences in Privacy Preferences 2 Regional Differences in Privacy Preferences: Implications for the Globalization of Electronic Commerce Privacy legislation differs around the world, creating a barrier to the globalization of electronic commerce. If consumers ’ privacy preferences are identical across cultures, then privacy legislation could be harmonized, allowing businesses to have global privacy practices. We surveyed the privacy and security concerns of Internet users in five regions of the globe: USA, Canada, Great Britain (the UK and Ireland), Continental Europe (current members of the EU), and Australia and New Zealand. While there are substantial areas of agreement, for example, that private information should not be shared without permission, consumers from the USA differ significantly from consumers in other regions,</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7099-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7099_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:31:37">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=10FE2128F3A6F0AF1904558994C3074C?doi=10.1.1.301.4969&amp;rank=2</link><title>jeteraps.scholarlinkresearch.org Perceived Stressors of Lecturers at the University of Ghana</title><description>jeteraps.scholarlinkresearch.org Perceived Stressors of Lecturers at the University of Ghana

According to appeasement hypotheses, embarrassment should have a distinct nonverbal display that is more readily perceived when displayed by individuals from lower status groups. The evidence from 5 studies supported these two claims. The nonverbal behavior of embarrassment was distinct from a related emotion (amusement), resembled the temporal pattern of facial expressions of emotion, was uniquely related to self-reports of embarrassment, and was accurately identified by observers who judged the spontaneous displays of various emotions. Across the judgment studies, observers were more accurate and attributed more emotion to the embarrassment displays of female and African-American targets than those of male and Caucasian targets. Discussion focused on the universality and appeasement function of the embarrassment display. Since universal facial expressions of a limited set of emotions were first documented (Ekman &amp; Friesen, 1971; Ekman, Sorenson, &amp; Friesen, 1969; Izard, 1971), sparse attention has been given to facial expressions of other emotions. The resulting lacuna in the field—that the emotions with identified displays are fewer (7 to 10) than the states that lay people (Fehr &amp; Russell,</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7099-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7099_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:33:41">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=10FE2128F3A6F0AF1904558994C3074C?doi=10.1.1.300.4735&amp;rank=4</link><title>A Modified F test for testing Homogeneity of Means against One-sided alternatives</title><description>A Modified F test for testing Homogeneity of Means against One-sided alternatives

To my sweet aunties, Nora and Toots, I miss you both very much. Acknowledgments This study is the capstone experience of the very special years I have spent in my doctoral program at The University of Texas at Austin. My time in Austin has been highly rewarding, both personally and professionally. For giving me this opportunity, I would like to thank my advisor and mentor, Dr. Herb Rieth, for inviting me to be one of his advisees, and for his unqualified and unwavering support over the years. His vision of what I could achieve and the daily modeling of kindness and humor as he prodded me along set a very high standard—I can only hope to be the kind of mentor to others that he has been to me. I would like to express my appreciation to my committee members, Diane and Brian Bryant, Mark O’Reilly, and Min Liu, for the time and energy each of you has invested in my work, not just in this dissertation process, but over the years at UT. I would like to thank two professors from my master’s program at Montclair State University, too. To Elaine Fine, thank you for your love and enthusiasm for the field of special education and for encouraging me to pursue a higher level of learning, and thank you to Dr. Paul</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7099-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7099_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:36:49">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=10FE2128F3A6F0AF1904558994C3074C?doi=10.1.1.151.1199&amp;rank=7</link><title>BASIC MULTIVARIATE THEMES AND METHODS</title><description>BASIC MULTIVARIATE THEMES AND METHODS
