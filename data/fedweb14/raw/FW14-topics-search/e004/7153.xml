We survey basic garbage collection algorithms, and variations such as incremental and generational collection; we then discuss low-level implementation considerations and the relationships between storage management systems, languages, and compilers. Throughout, we attempt to present a uni ed view based on abstract traversal strategies, addressing issues of conservatism, opportunism, and immediacy of reclamation; we also point outavariety of implementation details that are likely to have a significant impact on performance.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7153-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7153_06.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:04:05">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=291B68BA50F383392A3E0BD26B30D522?doi=10.1.1.139.3473&amp;rank=6</link><title>The Twin Crises: The Causes of Banking and Balance-of-Payments Problems</title><description>The Twin Crises: The Causes of Banking and Balance-of-Payments Problems

In the wake of the Mexican and Asian currency turmoil, the subject of financial crises has come to the forefront of academic and policy discussions. This paper analyzes the links between banking and currency crises. We find that: problems in the banking sector typically precede a currency crisis—the currency crisis deepens the banking crisis, activating a vicious spiral; financial liberalization often precedes banking crises. The anatomy of these episodes suggests that crises occur as the economy enters a recession, following a prolonged boom in economic activity that was fueled by credit, capital inflows, and accompanied by an overvalued currency.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7153-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7153_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:04:28">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=291B68BA50F383392A3E0BD26B30D522?doi=10.1.1.320.1159&amp;rank=7</link><title>Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation</title><description>Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation

People in different cultures have strikingly different construals of the self, of others, and of the interdependence of the 2. These construals can influence, and in many cases determine, the very nature of individual experience, including cognition, emotion, and motivation. Many Asian cultures have distinct conceptions of individuality that insist on the fundamental relatedness of individuals to each other. The emphasis is on attending to others, fitting in, and harmonious interdependence with them. American culture neither assumes nor values such an overt connectedness among individuals. In contrast, individuals seek to maintain their independence from others by attending to the self and by discovering and expressing their unique inner attributes. As proposed herein, these construals are even more powerful than previously imagined. Theories of the self from both psychology and anthropology are integrated to define in detail the difference between a construal of the self as independent and a construal of the self as interdependent. Each of these divergent construals should have a set of specific consequences for cognition, emotion, and motivation; these consequences are proposed and relevant empirical literature is reviewed. Focusing on differences in self-construals enables apparently inconsistent empirical findings to be reconciled, and raises questions about what have been thought to be culture-free aspects of cognition, emotion,</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7153-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7153_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:04:47">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=291B68BA50F383392A3E0BD26B30D522?doi=10.1.1.11.3193&amp;rank=8</link><title>Using Lexical Chains for Text Summarization</title><description>Using Lexical Chains for Text Summarization

We investigate one technique to produce a summary of an original text without requiring its full semantic interpretation, but instead relying on a model of the topic progression in the text derived from lexical chains. We present a new algorithm to compute lexical chains in a text, merging several robust knowledge sources: the WordNet thesaurus, a part-of-speech tagger and shallow parser for the ldentification of nominal groups, and a segmentation algorithm derived from (Hearst, 1994) Summarization proceeds in three steps: the original text m first segmented, lexical chains are constructed, strong chains are identified and significant sentences are extracted from the text. We present in this paper empirical results on the identification of strong chain and of significant sentences.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7153-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7153_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:05:08">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=291B68BA50F383392A3E0BD26B30D522?doi=10.1.1.10.6389&amp;rank=9</link><title>Bottom-Up Relational Learning of Pattern Matching Rules for Information Extraction</title><description>Bottom-Up Relational Learning of Pattern Matching Rules for Information Extraction

Information extraction is a form of shallow text processing that locates a specified set of relevant items in a natural-language document. Systems for this task require significant domain-specific knowledge and are time-consuming and difficult to build by hand, making them a good application for machine learning. We present an algorithm, RAPIER, that uses pairs of sample documents and filled templates to induce pattern-match rules that directly extract fillers for the slots in the template. RAPIER is a bottom-up learning algorithm that incorporates techniques from several inductive logic programming systems. We have implemented the algorithm in a system that allows patterns to have constraints on the words, part-of-speech tags, and semantic classes present in the filler and the surrounding text. We present encouraging experimental results on two domains.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7153-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7153_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:05:29">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=291B68BA50F383392A3E0BD26B30D522?doi=10.1.1.136.7906&amp;rank=10</link><title>Web Document Clustering: A Feasibility Demonstration</title><description>Web Document Clustering: A Feasibility Demonstration

Abstract Users of Web search engines are often forced to sift through the long ordered list of document “snippets” returned by the engines. The IR community has explored document clustering as an alternative method of organizing retrieval results, but clustering has yet to be deployed on the major search engines. The paper articulates the unique requirements of Web document clustering and reports on the first evaluation of clustering methods in this domain. A key requirement is that the methods create their clusters based on the short snippets returned by Web search engines. Surprisingly, we find that clusters based on snippets are almost as good as clusters created using the full text of Web documents. To satisfy the stringent requirements of the Web domain, we introduce an incremental, linear time (in the document collection size) algorithm called Suffix Tree Clustering (STC). which creates clusters based on phrases shared between documents. We show that STC is faster than standard clustering methods in this domain, and argue that Web document clustering via STC is both feasible and potentially beneficial. 1</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
