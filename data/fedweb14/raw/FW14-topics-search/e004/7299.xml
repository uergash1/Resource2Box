This article gives a brief introduction to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (or OEIS). The OEIS is a database of nearly 90,000 sequences of integers, arranged lexicographically.

Abstract. Data analysis applications typically aggregate data across many dimensions looking for anomalies or unusual patterns. The SQL aggregate functions and the GROUP BY operator produce zero-dimensional or one-dimensional aggregates. Applications need the N-dimensional generalization of these operators. This paper defines that operator, called the data cube or simply cube. The cube operator generalizes the histogram, crosstabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and sub-total constructs found in most report writers. The novelty is that cubes are relations. Consequently, the cube operator can be imbedded in more complex non-procedural data analysis programs. The cube operator treats each of the N aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular set of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces. This paper (1) explains the cube and roll-up operators, (2) shows how they fit in SQL, (3) explains how users can define new aggregate functions for cubes, and (4) discusses efficient techniques to compute the cube. Many of these features are being added to the SQL Standard.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7299-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7299_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:26:34">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C1A3FCA047E99D59CF9C2C1AFA8D0BC4?doi=10.1.1.49.6954&amp;rank=4</link><title>Using SeDuMi 1.02, a MATLAB toolbox for optimization over symmetric cones</title><description>Using SeDuMi 1.02, a MATLAB toolbox for optimization over symmetric cones

SeDuMi is an add-on for MATLAB, that lets you solve optimization problems with linear, quadratic and semidefiniteness constraints. It is possible to have complex valued data and variables in SeDuMi. Moreover, large scale optimization problems are solved efficiently, by exploiting sparsity. This paper describes how to work with this toolbox.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7299-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7299_05.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:26:52">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C1A3FCA047E99D59CF9C2C1AFA8D0BC4?doi=10.1.1.11.6264&amp;rank=5</link><title>Agents and the Semantic Web</title><description>Agents and the Semantic Web

Many challenges of bringing communicating multiagent systems to the Web require ontologies. The integration of agent technology and ontologies could significantly affect the use of Web services and the ability to extend programs to perform tasks for users more efficiently and with less human intervention.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7299-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7299_06.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:27:10">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C1A3FCA047E99D59CF9C2C1AFA8D0BC4?doi=10.1.1.31.1768&amp;rank=6</link><title>The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web</title><description>The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web

The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a method for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7299-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7299_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:27:22">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C1A3FCA047E99D59CF9C2C1AFA8D0BC4?doi=10.1.1.33.2176&amp;rank=7</link><title>Wrapper Induction for Information Extraction</title><description>Wrapper Induction for Information Extraction

The Internet presents numerous sources of useful information---telephone directories, product catalogs, stock quotes, weather forecasts, etc. Recently, many systems have been built that automatically gather and manipulate such information on a user's behalf. However, these resources are usually formatted for use by people (e.g., the relevant content is embedded in HTML pages), so extracting their content is difficult. Wrappers are often used for this purpose. A wrapper is a procedure for extracting a particular resource's content. Unfortunately, hand-coding wrappers is tedious. We introduce wrapper induction, a technique for automatically constructing wrappers. Our techniques can be described in terms of three main contributions. First, we pose the problem of wrapper construction as one of inductive learn...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7299-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7299_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:27:41">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C1A3FCA047E99D59CF9C2C1AFA8D0BC4?doi=10.1.1.79.5346&amp;rank=8</link><title>A stochastic parts program and noun phrase parser for unrestricted text</title><description>A stochastic parts program and noun phrase parser for unrestricted text

alice!k-wc It is well-known that part of speech depends on context. The word &amp;quot;table, &amp;quot; for example, can be a verb in some contexts (e.g., &amp;quot;He will table the motion&amp;quot;) and a noun in others (e.g., &amp;quot;The table is ready&amp;quot;). A program has been written which tags each word in an input sentence with the most likely part of speech. The program produces the following output for the two &amp;quot;table &amp;quot; sentences just mentioned: • He/PPS will/lVlD table/VB the/AT motion/NN./. • The/AT table]NN is/BEZ ready/J/./.

The abbreviated name,‘mfold web server’,describes a number of closely related software applications available on the World Wide Web (WWW) for the prediction of the secondary structure of single stranded nucleic acids. The objective of this web server is to provide easy access to RNA and DNA folding and hybridization software to the scientific community at large. By making use of universally available web GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces),the server circumvents the problem of portability of this software. Detailed output,in the form of structure plots with or without reliability information,single strand frequency plots and ‘energy dot plots’, are available for the folding of single sequences. A variety of ‘bulk ’ servers give less information,but in a shorter time and for up to hundreds of sequences at once. The portal for the mfold web server is</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7299-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7299_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 22:28:16">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C1A3FCA047E99D59CF9C2C1AFA8D0BC4?doi=10.1.1.55.1832&amp;rank=10</link><title>An Information-Theoretic Definition of Similarity</title><description>An Information-Theoretic Definition of Similarity

Similarity is an important and widely used concept. Previous definitions of similarity are tied to a particular application or a form of knowledge representation. We present an informationtheoretic definition of similarity that is applicable as long as there is a probabilistic model. We demonstrate how our definition can be used to measure the similarity in a number of different domains.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
