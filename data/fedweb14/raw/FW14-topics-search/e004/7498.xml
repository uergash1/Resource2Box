Wireless microsensor networks have been identified as one of the most important technologies for the 21st century. This paper traces the history of research in sensor networks over the past three decades, including two important programs of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) spanning this period: the Distributed Sensor Networks (DSN) and the Sensor</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7498-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7498_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 01:42:33">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=4091DD6F69CE598B38492A39EA170645?doi=10.1.1.11.9982&amp;rank=2</link><title>Word-Sense Disambiguation Using Statistical Models of Roget's Categories Trained on Large Corpora</title><description>Word-Sense Disambiguation Using Statistical Models of Roget's Categories Trained on Large Corpora

This paper describes a program that disambiguates English word senses in unrestricted text using statistical models of the major Roget's Thesaurus categories. Roget's categories serve as approximations of conceptual classes. The categories listed for a word in Roget's index tend to correspond to sense distinctions; thus selecting the most likely category provides a useful level of sense disambiguation. The selection of categories is accomplished by identifying and weighting words that are indicative of each category when seen in context, using a Bayesian theoretical framework.

Abstract-Intelligence is defined as that which produces successful behavior. Intelligence is assumed to result from natural selection. A model is proposed that integrates knowledge from research in both natural and artificial systems. The model consists of a hierarchical system architecture wherein: 1) control bandwidth decreases about an order of magnitude at each higher level, 2) perceptual resolution of spatial and temporal patterns contracts about an order-of-magnitude at each higher level, 3) goals expand in scope and planning horizons expand in space and time about an order-of-magnitude at each higher level, and 4) models of the world and memories of events expand their range in space and time by about an order-of-magnitude at each higher level. At each level, functional modules perform behavior generation (task decomposition planning and execution), world modeling, sensory processing, and value judgment. Sensory feedback control loops are closed at every level.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the scope and functionality of a versatile environment for testing small and large-scale nonlinear optimization algorithms. Although many of these facilities were originally produced by the authors in conjunction with the software package LANCELOT, we believe that they will be useful in their own right and should be available to researchers for their development of optimization software. The tools are available by anonymous ftp from a number of sources and may, in many cases, be installed automatically. The scope of a major collection of test problems written in the standard input format (SIF) used by the LANCELOT software package is described. Recognising that most software was not written with the SIF in mind, we provide tools to assist in building an interface between this input format and other optimization packages. These tools already provide a link between the SIF and an number of existing packages, including MINOS and OSL. In ad...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
