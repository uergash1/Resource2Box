This paper addresses the issue of Web document summarization. As textual content of Web documents is often scarce or irrelevant and existing summarization techniques are based on it, many Web pages and websites cannot be suitably summarized. We consider the context of a Web document by the textual content of all the documents linking to it. To summarize a target Web document, a context-based summarizer has to perform a preprocessing task, during which it will be decided which pieces of information in the source documents are relevant to the content of the target. Then a context-based summarizer faces two issues: first, the selected elements may partially deal with the topic of the target, second they may be related to the target and yet not contain any clues about the content of the target.

Abstract. Statistical language models can learn relationships between topics discussed in a document collection and persons, organizations and places mentioned in each document. We present a novel combination of statistical topic models and named-entity recognizers to jointly analyze entities mentioned (persons, organizations and places) and topics discussed in a collection of 330,000 New York Times news articles. We demonstrate an analytic framework which automatically extracts from a large collection: topics; topic trends; and topics that relate entities. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7138-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7138_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 15:18:53">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C83768668F3F0FBD5CCDB8EC0C1AB32B?doi=10.1.1.222.6462&amp;rank=8</link><title>Conventional implicatures, a distinguished class of meanings</title><description>Conventional implicatures, a distinguished class of meanings

While every firm in a supply chain bears supply risk (the cost of insufficient supply), some firms may, even with wholesale price contracts, completely avoid inventory risk (the cost of unsold inventory). With a push contract there is a single wholesale price and the retailer, by ordering his entire supply before the selling season, bears all of the supply chain’s inventory risk. A pull contract also has a single wholesale price, but the supplier bears the supply chain’s inventory risk because only the supplier holds inventory while the retailer replenishes as needed during the season. (Examples include Vendor Managed Inventory with consignment and drop shipping.) An advance-purchase discount has two wholesale prices: a discounted price for inventory purchased before the season, and a regular price for replenishments during the selling season. Advance-purchase discounts allow for intermediate allocations of inventory risk: The retailer bears the risk on inventory ordered before the season while the supplier bears the risk on any production in excess of that amount. This research studies how the allocation of inventory risk (via these three types of wholesale price contracts) impacts supply chain efficiency (the ratio of the supply chain’s profit to its maximum profit). It is found that the efficiency of a single wholesale price contract is considerably higher than previously thought as long as firms consider both push and pull contracts. In other words, the literature has exaggerated the value of implementing coordinating contracts (i.e., contracts that achieve 100 % efficiency, such as buy-backs or revenue sharing) because coordinating</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7138-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7138_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 15:19:28">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=C83768668F3F0FBD5CCDB8EC0C1AB32B?doi=10.1.1.111.6491&amp;rank=10</link><title>Mobile Virtual Healthcare Communities: An Approach To Community Engineering For Cancer Patients</title><description>Mobile Virtual Healthcare Communities: An Approach To Community Engineering For Cancer Patients

In this paper we describe mobile virtual healthcare communities as a solution for meeting cancer patients information and interaction needs. After an introduction into the healthcare system and its potential starting points for virtual communities, we focus on cancer patients. We analyse their situation through field studies and identify information and interaction needs. On this basis we derive requirements for user centric socio technical system design for cancer patients. As at present no existing offers meet these prerequisite, we intend to develop and implement a mobile healthcare community for cancer patients. The objective is to introduce a socially accepted, technically stable and economically reasonable system. By the time of the conference we assume to have implemented this community platform. 1</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
