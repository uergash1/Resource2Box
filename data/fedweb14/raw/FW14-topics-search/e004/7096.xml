We present a task-based taxonomy of navigation techniques for 3D virtual environments, used to categorize existing techniques, drive exploration of the design space, and inspire new techniques. We briefly discuss several new techniques, and describe in detail one new technique, Speed-coupled Flying with Orbiting. This technique couples control of movement speed to camera height and tilt, allowing users to seamlessly transition between local environment-views and global overviews. Users can also orbit specific objects for inspection. Results from two competitive user studies suggest users performed better with Speed-coupled Flying with Orbiting over alternatives, with performance also enhanced by a large display.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7096-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7096_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:58:34">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=9DA42A22E729056C19AAA8BB8B911F28?doi=10.1.1.388.4053&amp;rank=2</link><title>ABSTRACT</title><description>ABSTRACT

In this paper, we present LAMP3D, a system for the locationaware presentation of VRML content on mobile devices. We explore the application of LAMP3D in tourist mobile guides: the system is used to provide tourists with a 3D visualization of the environment they are exploring, synchronized with the physical world through the use of GPS data; tourists can easily obtain information on the objects they see in the real world by directly selecting them in the VRML world. We discuss the design and development of the system and report about the feedback obtained from the informal user testing we carried out.

3D transformation widgets are commonly used in many 3D applications operated from mice and keyboards. These user interfaces allow independent control of translations, rotations, and scaling for manipulation of 3D objects. In this paper, we study how these widgets can be adapted to the tactile paradigm. We have explored an approach where users apply rotations by means of physically plausible gestures, and we have extended successful 2D tactile principles to the context of 3D interaction. These investigations led to the design of a new 3D transformation widget, tBox, that can been operated easily and efficiently from gestures on touch-screens.

Two experiments comparing user performance on ClearType and Regular displays are reported. In the first, 26 participants scanned a series of spreadsheets for target information. Speed of performance was significantly faster with ClearType. In the second experiment, 25 users read two articles for meaning. Reading speed was significantly faster for ClearType. In both experiments no differences in accuracy of performance or visual fatigue scores were observed. The data also reveal substantial individual differences in performance suggesting ClearType may not be universally beneficial to information workers.

Abstract \- Cited by 2 (0 self) \- Add to MetaCart

Interaction patterns with handheld mobile devices are constantly evolving. Researchers observed that users prefer to interact with mobile device using one hand. However, only few interaction techniques support this mode of operation. We show that onehanded operations can be enhanced with coordinated interaction using for input the front and back of a mobile device, which we term as Dual-Surface interaction. We present some of the design rationale for introducing coordinated Dual-Surface interactions. We demonstrate that several tasks, including target selection, benefit from Dual-Surface input which allows users to rapidly select small targets in locations that are less accessible when interacting using the thumb with one-handed input. Furthermore, we demonstrate the benefits of virtual enhancements that are possible with behind-the-display relative input to perform complex tasks, such as steering. Our results show that Dual-Surface interactions offer numerous benefits that are not available with input on the front or the back alone.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7096-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7096_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:06:36">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=9DA42A22E729056C19AAA8BB8B911F28?doi=10.1.1.177.2077&amp;rank=9</link><title>Hands on Music: Physical Approach to Interaction with Digital Music</title><description>Hands on Music: Physical Approach to Interaction with Digital Music

Mobile users listen to large digital music libraries with thousands of songs. Browsing such libraries in mobile contexts is difficult due to constraints of the context and devices. We explore the usage of physical interaction with digital music to overcome these limitations. Our solution is to utilize the physical orientation of a mobile device as a tool for exploring music. We focus on allowing users to manage their music for easier mobile access. We present a novel bimanual interaction method for mapping items from a music library into different orientations of the mobile device. An experiment was conducted to test our prototype, focusing on efficiency and ����������������������������recall locations of items in the mapping. The interaction method was found to be significantly faster than using a touch screen without the mobile device. Subjectively users valued the bimanual method in ease of use, efficiency, and pleasantness.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7096-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7096_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:07:40">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=9DA42A22E729056C19AAA8BB8B911F28?doi=10.1.1.161.5980&amp;rank=10</link><title>One-Handed Behind-the-Display Cursor Input on Mobile Devices</title><description>One-Handed Behind-the-Display Cursor Input on Mobile Devices
