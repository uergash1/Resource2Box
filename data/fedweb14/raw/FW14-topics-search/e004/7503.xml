Abstract- This paper deals with a new class of convolutional codes called Turbo-codes, whose performances in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) are close to the SHANNON limit. The Turbo-Code encoder is built using a parallel concatenation of two Recursive Systematic Convolutional codes and the associated decoder, using a feedback decoding rule, is implemented as P pipelined identical elementary decoders. Consider a binary rate R=1/2 convolutional encoder with constraint length K and memory M=K-1. The input to the encoder at time k is a bit dk and the corresponding codeword</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7503-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7503_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 02:48:22">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=9D018AA3CF354FE013D31B24523BEAF8?doi=10.1.1.412.6372&amp;rank=3</link><title>The Viterbi algorithm</title><description>The Viterbi algorithm

Abstract- Iterative decoding of two-dimensional systematic convolutional codes has been termed “turbo ” (de)coding. Using log-likelihood algebra, we show that any decoder can he used which accepts soft inputs-including a priori values-and delivers soft outputs that can he split into three terms: the soft channel and a priori inputs, and the extrinsic value. The extrinsic value is used as an a priori value for the next iteration. Decoding algorithms in the log-likelihood domain are given not only for convolutional codes hut also for any linear binary systematic block code. The iteration is controlled by a stop criterion derived from cross entropy, which results in a minimal number of iterations. Optimal and suboptimal decoders with reduced complexity are presented. Simulation results show that very simple component codes are sufficient, block codes are appropriate for high rates and convolutional codes for lower rates less than 213. Any combination of block and convolutional component codes is possible. Several interleaving techniques are described. At a bit error rate (BER) of lo- * the performance is slightly above or around the bounds given by the cutoff rate for reasonably simple block/convolutional component codes, interleaver sizes less than 1000 and for three to six iterations. Index Terms- Concatenated codes, product codes, iterative decoding, “soft-inlsoft-out ” decoder, “turbo ” (de)coding.

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

This paper explores a new depth-recovery technique targeted for two environments: visualization on non-regular screen surfaces, and real-time depth recovery in an unknown scene. The algorithm is based on the computation of pre-warped images that are projected into the scene and re-imaged by synchronized cameras. The real-time control of the pre-warp and the type of imagery projected into the scene allows for a novel solution that recovers scene geometry and can be used in both visualization (projection of imagery onto screen surfaces) and computer vision environments

Abstract. A new adaptive tessellation method for general Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces is presented. Development of the new method is based on the observation that optimum adaptive tessellation for rendering purpose is a recursive error evaluation and globalization process. The adaptive tessellation process is done by generating an inscribing polyhedron to approximate the limit surface for each individual patch. The inscribing polyhedron is generated through an adaptive subdivision on the patch’s parameter space driven by a recursive error evaluation process. This approach generates less faces in the resulting approximating mesh while meeting the given precision requirement. The crack problem is avoided through globalization of new vertices generated in the adaptive subdivision process of the parameter space. No crack-detection or crack-elimination is needed in the adaptive tessellation process. Therefore, no mesh element splitting to eliminate cracks is necessary. The new adaptive tessellation method can precisely measure the error for every point of the limit surface. Hence, it has complete control of the accuracy of the tessellation result. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7503-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7503_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 02:55:19">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=9D018AA3CF354FE013D31B24523BEAF8?doi=10.1.1.36.5375&amp;rank=6</link><title>hAlan.Mycroft@cl.cam.ac.uki</title><description>hAlan.Mycroft@cl.cam.ac.uki
