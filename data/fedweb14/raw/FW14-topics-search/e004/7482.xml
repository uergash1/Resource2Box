The problem of combining preferences arises in several applications, such as combining the results of different search engines. This work describes an efficient algorithm for combining multiple preferences. We first give a formal framework for the problem. We then describe and analyze a new boosting algorithm for combining preferences called RankBoost. We also describe an efficient implementation of the algorithm for certain natural cases. We discuss two experiments we carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost. In the first experiment, we used the algorithm to combine different WWW search strategies, each of which is a query expansion for a given domain. For this task, we compare the performance of RankBoost to the individual search strategies. The second experiment is a collaborative-filtering task for making movie recommendations. Here, we present results comparing RankBoost to nearest-neighbor and regression algorithms.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7482-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7482_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:55:25">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3F38179BDDECAEE7E18FF17AC9E1C94B?doi=10.1.1.123.805&amp;rank=3</link><title>Visual Information Seeking: Tight Coupling of Dynamic Query Filters with Starfield Displays</title><description>Visual Information Seeking: Tight Coupling of Dynamic Query Filters with Starfield Displays

This paper offers new principles for visual information seeking (VIS). A key concept is to support browsing, which is distinguished from familiar query composition and information retrieval because of its emphasis on rapid filtering to reduce result sets, progressive refinement of search parameters, continuous reformulation of goals, and visual scanning to identify results. VIS principles developed include: dynamic query filters (query parameters are rapidly adjusted with sliders, buttons, maps, etc.), starfield displays (two-dimensional scatterplots to structure result sets and zooming to reduce clutter), and tight coupling (interrelating query components to preserve display invariants and support progressive refinement combined with an emphasis on using search output to foster search input). A FilmFinder prototype using a movie database demonstrates these principles in a VIS environment.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7482-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7482_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:58:10">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3F38179BDDECAEE7E18FF17AC9E1C94B?doi=10.1.1.335.7866&amp;rank=4</link><title>Tangible bits: towards seamless interfaces between people, bits and atoms</title><description>Tangible bits: towards seamless interfaces between people, bits and atoms

This paper presents our vision of Human Computer Interaction (HCI): "Tangible Bits. " Tangible Bits allows users to "grasp &amp; manipulate " bits in the center of users’ attention by coupling the bits with everyday physical objects and architectural surfaces. Tangible Bits also enables users to be aware of background bits at the periphery of human perception using ambient display media such as light, sound, airflow, and water movement in an augmented space. The goal of Tangible Bits is to bridge the gaps between both cyberspace and the physical environment, as well as the foreground and background of human activities. This paper describes three key concepts of Tangible Bits: interactive surfaces; the coupling of bits with graspable physical objects; and ambient media for background awareness. We illustrate these concepts with three prototype systems – the metaDESK, transBOARD and ambientROOM – to identify underlying research issues.

We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative. Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7482-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7482_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:59:57">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3F38179BDDECAEE7E18FF17AC9E1C94B?doi=10.1.1.229.1174&amp;rank=6</link><title>Beyond bags of features: Spatial pyramid matching for recognizing natural scene categories</title><description>Beyond bags of features: Spatial pyramid matching for recognizing natural scene categories

This paper presents a method for recognizing scene categories based on approximate global geometric correspondence. This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting “spatial pyramid ” is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba’s “gist ” and Lowe’s SIFT descriptors. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7482-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7482_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 20:02:53">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3F38179BDDECAEE7E18FF17AC9E1C94B?doi=10.1.1.1.4458&amp;rank=7</link><title>Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing</title><description>Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing

Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing is a novel approach to automated document indexing which is based on a statistical latent class model for factor analysis of count data. Fitted from a training corpus of text documents by a generalization of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, the utilized model is able to deal with domain-specific synonymy as well as with polysemous words. In contrast to standard Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by Singular Value Decomposition, the probabilistic variant has a solid statistical foundation and defines a proper generative data model. Retrieval experiments on a number of test collections indicate substantial performance gains over direct term matching methodsaswell as over LSI. In particular, the combination of models with different dimensionalities has proven to be advantageous.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7482-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7482_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 20:05:22">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3F38179BDDECAEE7E18FF17AC9E1C94B?doi=10.1.1.121.1027&amp;rank=8</link><title>A reliable multicast framework for light-weight sessions and application level framing</title><description>A reliable multicast framework for light-weight sessions and application level framing

Abstract — This paper describes Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM), a reliable multicast framework for light-weight sessions and application level framing. The algorithms of this framework are efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions. The SRM framework has been prototyped in wb, a distributed whiteboard application, which has been used on a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to a few hundred participants. The paper describes the principles that have guided the SRM design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application level framing protocol model. As with unicast communications, the performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the underlying topology and operational environment. We investigate that dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery. With the adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies.

Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis is a novel statistical technique for the analysis of two--mode and co-occurrence data, which has applications in information retrieval and filtering, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. Compared to standard Latent Semantic Analysis which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed method is based on a mixture decomposition derived from a latent class model. This results in a more principled approach which has a solid foundation in statistics. In order to avoid overfitting, we propose a widely applicable generalization of maximum likelihood model fitting by tempered EM. Our approach yields substantial and consistent improvements over Latent Semantic Analysis in a number of experiments.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7482-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7482_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 20:09:15">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3F38179BDDECAEE7E18FF17AC9E1C94B?doi=10.1.1.16.8178&amp;rank=10</link><title>Scalable Application Layer Multicast</title><description>Scalable Application Layer Multicast

We describe a new scalable application-layer multicast protocol, specifically designed for low-bandwidth, data streaming applications with large receiver sets. Our scheme is based upon a hierarchical clustering of the application-layer multicast peers and can support a number of different data delivery trees with specific desirable properties. We show that group members maintain state for a constant number of other membersand the control overhead is also a constant.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
