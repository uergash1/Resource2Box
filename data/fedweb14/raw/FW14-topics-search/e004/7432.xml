hose properties, capabilities, interfaces, and effects are encoded in an unambiguous, machine-understandable form. The realization of the Semantic Web is underway with the development of new AI-inspired content markup languages, such as OIL, 3 DAML+OIL (www.daml.org/2000/10/daml-oil), and DAML-L (the last two are members of the DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) family of languages). 4 These languages have a well-defined semantics and enable the markup and manipulation of complex taxonomic and logical relations between entities on the Web. A fundamental component of the Semantic Web will be the markup of Web services to make them computer-interpretable, use-apparent, and agent-ready. This article addresses precisely this component. We present an approach to Web service markup that provides an agent-independent declarative API capturing the data and metadata associated with a service together with specifications of its pro</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7432-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7432_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 00:01:53">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3150A75538833FE679994FE5AED250CF?doi=10.1.1.154.9045&amp;rank=2</link><title>QoS-aware middleware for web services composition</title><description>QoS-aware middleware for web services composition

Abstract—The paradigmatic shift from a Web of manual interactions to a Web of programmatic interactions driven by Web services is creating unprecedented opportunities for the formation of online Business-to-Business (B2B) collaborations. In particular, the creation of value-added services by composition of existing ones is gaining a significant momentum. Since many available Web services provide overlapping or identical functionality, albeit with different Quality of Service (QoS), a choice needs to be made to determine which services are to participate in a given composite service. This paper presents a middleware platform which addresses the issue of selecting Web services for the purpose of their composition in a way that maximizes user satisfaction expressed as utility functions over QoS attributes, while satisfying the constraints set by the user and by the structure of the composite service. Two selection approaches are described and compared: one based on local (task-level) selection of services and the other based on global allocation of tasks to services using integer programming. Index Terms—Web services, quality of service, service composition, integer programming. æ 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7432-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7432_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 00:03:07">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3150A75538833FE679994FE5AED250CF?doi=10.1.1.409.3424&amp;rank=3</link><title>Efficient ticket routing by resolution sequence mining</title><description>Efficient ticket routing by resolution sequence mining

The views expressed in ChainLinks are not necessarily those of CAN. Bicycling Is Not A Crime… Or is it? Bicycling without a helmet in NZ can earn up to a $500 fine. But Do Helmets Work? A study published in Accident Analysis and Prevention in 1997 by Scuffham on voluntary helmet wearing rates in NZ between 1986 and 1993 found no association with head injury despite an increase from 5 % to 65 % in helmet use. This is the definitive piece in NZ on bicycle helmet effectiveness. Why Wouldn’t Helmets Work? It has been known for 20 years that serious head injury occurs because of the head rapidly rotating around its own axis. Imagine a football spinning on a pole. Add a helmet to this. A helmet will not reduce the forces and may by adding to the weight and volume of the head actually increase them. Helmets will protect against superficial injury but these are treatable and rarely life threatening. But what’s the problem in wearing a helmet?</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7432-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7432_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 00:08:27">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=3150A75538833FE679994FE5AED250CF?doi=10.1.1.220.2412&amp;rank=7</link><title>VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2 Mar/Apr 2012</title><description>VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2 Mar/Apr 2012
