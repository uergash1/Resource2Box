To successfully apply evolutionary algorithms to the solution of increasingly complex problems, we must develop effective techniques for evolving solutions in the form of interacting coadapted subcomponents. One of the major difficulties is finding computational extensions to our current evolutionary paradigms that will enable such subcomponents to “emerge ” rather than being hand designed. In this paper, we describe an architecture for evolving such subcomponents as a collection of cooperating species. Given a simple stringmatching task, we show that evolutionary pressure to increase the overall fitness of the ecosystem can provide the needed stimulus for the emergence of an appropriate number of interdependent subcomponents that cover multiple niches, evolve to an appropriate level of generality, and adapt as the number and roles of their fellow subcomponents change over time. We then explore these issues within the context of a more complicated domain through a case study involving the evolution of artificial neural networks.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7461-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7461_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 11:55:21">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=89552B3986F4031EFE3CB9826C7435C0?doi=10.1.1.169.2566&amp;rank=5</link><title>Latest News from the President of INNS 1</title><description>Latest News from the President of INNS 1

wcohen~research.att.com Two methods for learning text classifiers are compared on classification problems that might arise in filtering and filing personM e-mail messages: a "traxiitionM IR " method based on TF-IDF weighting, and a new method for learning sets of "keyword-spotting rules " based on the RIPPER rule learning algorithm. It is demonstrated that both methods obtain significant generalizations from a small number of examples; that both methods are comparable in generalization performance on problems of this type; and that both methods axe reasonably efficient, even with fairly large training sets. However, the greater comprehensibility of the rules may be advantageous in a system that allows users to extend or otherwise modify a learned classifier.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7461-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7461_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 12:04:01">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=89552B3986F4031EFE3CB9826C7435C0?doi=10.1.1.87.2864&amp;rank=9</link><title>Analysis of Topological Characteristics of Huge Online Social Networking Services</title><description>Analysis of Topological Characteristics of Huge Online Social Networking Services

File prefetching is an effective technique for improving file access performance. In this paper, we present a file prefetching mechanism that is based on on-line analytic modeling of interesting system events and is transparent to higher levels. The mechanism, incorporated into a client's file cache manager, seeks to build semantic structures that capture the intrinsic correlations between file accesses. It then heuristically uses these structures to represent distinct file usage patterns and exploits them to prefetch files from a file server. We show results of a simulation study and of a working implementation. Measurements suggest that our method can predict future file accesses with an accuracy around 90%, that it can reduce cache miss rate by up to 47% and application latency by up to 40%. Our method imposes little overhead, even under antagonistic circumstances. 1 Introduction This paper reports the effectiveness of a predictive file prefetching technique that operates automat...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
