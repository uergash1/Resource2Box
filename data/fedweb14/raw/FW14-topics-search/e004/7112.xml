Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

This paper presents an application for collaborative brainstorming on shared digital displays that integrates online content to help create new ideas during the brainstorming process. The brainstorming application links ideas under discussion to their best matched Wikipedia pages, suggests related ideas for deeper discussion based on items “pinned” on the whiteboard, and recommends a broader scope of new ideas based on users ’ experiences and expertise, as derived from their social networking profiles. The software system for this application is described, including its idea recommendation engine and UI component. Experimental tests evaluating the application in the context of real users are presented.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7112-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7112_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:23:25">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=8518B28B9D1BB934E5CDC6EB1B5A17FD?doi=10.1.1.168.6310&amp;rank=8</link><title>Predicting tie strength with social media</title><description>Predicting tie strength with social media

Social media treats all users the same: trusted friend or total stranger, with little or nothing in between. In reality, relationships fall everywhere along this spectrum, a topic social science has investigated for decades under the theme of tie strength. Our work bridges this gap between theory and practice. In this paper, we present a predictive model that maps social media data to tie strength. The model builds on a dataset of over 2,000 social media ties and performs quite well, distinguishing between strong and weak ties with over 85 % accuracy. We complement these quantitative findings with interviews that unpack the relationships we could not predict. The paper concludes by illustrating how modeling tie strength can improve social media design elements, including privacy controls, message routing, friend introductions and information prioritization.

Abstract \- Cited by 1 (0 self) \- Add to MetaCart

We carry out a hybrid lab and field study of a password manager program, and report on usability and security. Our study explores iPMAN, a browser-based password manager that in addition uses a graphical password scheme for the master password. We present our findings as a set of observations and insights expected to be of interest both to those exploring password managers, and graphical passwords. Motivated by our findings, but also of independent interest, we also present a new salt generation method using blind signatures, to protect against offline attacks, decreasing user inconvenience by generating salt significantly faster than earlier work (Halderman et al. 2005).</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
