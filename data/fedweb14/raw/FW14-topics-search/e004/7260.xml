In a 1935 paper, and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P -values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this paper we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology and psychology.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7260-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7260_02.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 20:51:54">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5BC67C3C863AE91BF006FE7206F89F09?doi=10.1.1.221.2247&amp;rank=2</link><title>Wireless sensor networks: a survey</title><description>Wireless sensor networks: a survey

This paper describes the concept of sensor networks which has been made viable by the convergence of microelectro-mechanical systems technology, wireless communications and digital electronics. First, the sensing tasks and the potential sensor networks applications are explored, and a review of factors influencing the design of sensor networks is provided. Then, the communication architecture for sensor networks is outlined, and the algorithms and protocols developed for each layer in the literature are explored. Open research issues for the realization of sensor networks are</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7260-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7260_03.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 20:52:14">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5BC67C3C863AE91BF006FE7206F89F09?doi=10.1.1.99.8377&amp;rank=3</link><title>The interdisciplinary study of coordination</title><description>The interdisciplinary study of coordination

Abstract \- Cited by 535 (14 self) \- Add to MetaCart

This survey characterizes an emerging research area, sometimes called coordination theory, that focuses on the interdisciplinary study of coordination. Research in this area uses and extends ideas about coordination from disciplines such as computer science, organization theory, operations research, economics, linguistics, and psychology. A key insight of the framework presented here is that coordination can be seen as the process of managing dependencies among activities. Further progress, therefore, should be possible by characterizing different kinds of dependencies and identifying the coordination processes that can be used to manage them. A variety of processes are analyzed from this perspective, and commonalities across disciplines are identified. Processes analyzed include those for managing shared resources, producer/consumer relationships, simultaneity constraints, and tank/subtask dependencies. Section 3 summarizes ways of applying a coordination perspective in three different domains: (1) understanding the effects of information technology on human organizations and markets, (2) designing cooperative work tools, and (3) designing distributed and parallel computer systems. In the final section, elements of a research</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7260-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7260_04.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 20:52:35">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5BC67C3C863AE91BF006FE7206F89F09?doi=10.1.1.154.5491&amp;rank=4</link><title>Organizations</title><description>Organizations
