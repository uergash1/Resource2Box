Work Placement in Third-Level Programmes is one of a number of significant outputs of the Roadmap for Employment–Academic Partnerships (REAP) Project. This report draws together for the first time perspectives on placement from all of the key stakeholders. In addition to providing a unique overview of the placement experience the project team have used the information gathered to develop a useful, transferable toolkit for placement.

Categorizations which humans make of the concrete world are not arbitrary but highly determined. In taxonomies of concrete objects, there is one level of abstraction at which the most basic category cuts are made. Basic categories are those which carry the most information, possess the highest category cue validity, and are, thus, the most differentiated from one another. The four experiments of Part I define basic objects by demonstrating that in taxonomies of common concrete nouns in English based on class inclusion, basic objects are the most inclusive categories whose members: (a) possess significant numbers of attributes in common, (b) have motor programs which are similar to one another, (c) have similar shapes, and (d) can be identified from averaged shapes of members of the class. The eight experiments of Part II explore implications of the structure of categories. Basic objects are shown to be the most inclusive categories for which a concrete image of the category as a whole can be formed, to be the first categorizations made during perception of the environment, to be the earliest categories sorted and earliest named by children, and to be the categories</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7015-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7015_06.html" timestamp="2014-05-15 13:43:10">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=EBAC5670A019281E8386BCB54B1D1398?doi=10.1.1.300.2871&amp;rank=6</link><title>A Bayesian Model of Rule Induction in Raven’s Progressive Matrices</title><description>A Bayesian Model of Rule Induction in Raven’s Progressive Matrices

Evolutionary computation is becoming common in the solution of difficult, realworld problems in industry, medicine, and defense. This paper reviews some of the practical advantages to using evolutionary algorithms as compared with classic methods of optimization or artificial intelligence. Specific advantages include the flexibility of the procedures, as well as the ability to self-adapt the search for optimum solutions on the fly. As desktop computers increase in speed, the application of evolutionary algorithms will become routine. 1 Introduction Darwinian evolution is intrinsically a robust search and optimization mechanism. Evolved biota demonstrate optimized complex behavior at every level: the cell, the organ, the individual, and the population. The problems that biological species have solved are typified by chaos, chance, temporality, and nonlinear interactivities. These are also characteristics of problems that have proved to be especially intractable to classic methods of o...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
