Perhaps the simplest and the most basic qualitative law of probability is the conjunction rule: The probability of a conjunction, P(A&amp;B), cannot exceed the probabilities of its constituents, P(A) and.P(B), because the extension (or the possibility set) of the conjunction is included in the extension of its constituents. Judgments under uncertainty, however, are often mediated by intuitive heuristics that are not bound by the conjunction rule. A conjunction can be more representative than one of its constituents, and instances of a specific category can be easier to imagine or to retrieve than instances of a more inclusive category. The representativeness and availability heuristics therefore can make a conjunction appear more probable than one of its constituents. This phenomenon is demonstrated in a variety of contexts including estimation of word frequency, personality judgment, medical prognosis, decision under risk, suspicion of criminal acts, and political forecasting. Systematic violations of the conjunction rule are observed in judgments of lay people and of experts in both between-subjects and within-subjects comparisons. Alternative interpretations of the conjunction fallacy are discussed and attempts to combat it are explored. Uncertainty is an unavoidable aspect of the the last decade (see, e.g., Einhorn &amp; Hogarth, human condition. Many significant choices must be based on beliefs about the likelihood</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7463-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7463_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 12:41:33">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CAC108B1971581F4B11A4805D66BFF9C?doi=10.1.1.228.571&amp;rank=3</link><title>The Internet Movie Database: A Reference Guide to Hollywood and Beyond</title><description>The Internet Movie Database: A Reference Guide to Hollywood and Beyond

This dissertation is dedicated to my former clients at TAPP, the Teenage Pregnancy and Parenting Project, in San Francisco. Acknowledgements I have been very lucky in this journey; many people have provided support, editorial and research assistance, and guiding lights along the way. First, I want to thank my parents, Verónica Beltrán Caudle and Rodney Caudle, for providing constant support throughout my doctoral program and for encouraging me to keep pushing ahead. ���� � �� � ���� � �������, Mom and Dad. The rest of my family also has been wonderfully supportive throughout this process, especially my brother Don and sister Anita. Next, I must thank my advisors, Charles Ramírez Berg and John D.H. Downing, for their warm support, close readings of my work, research and editorial suggestions, and life lessons. I’m blessed to have such positive, inspiring mentors in my life. ������ � ������ � also to my other committee members, Federico Subervi, Gigi Durham, and Craig Watkins, for their helpful encouragement and assistance. I’d like to express my gratitude to Federico in particular for helping me get started along this path and mentoring me in my first year in the doctoral program. I’d also like to thank Janet Staiger for her early assistance and guidance, and Thomas Schatz for his incisive recommendations as I was revising the dissertation. I also would like to thank the library staff of several archives who helped me locate and access publicity stills and other research materials for my three case studies. This includes Steve Wilson of the Harry Ransom Center for the</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7463-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7463_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 12:48:37">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CAC108B1971581F4B11A4805D66BFF9C?doi=10.1.1.297.5663&amp;rank=6</link><title>1\.

Abstract—In recent years, social media has become ubiquitous and important for social networking and content sharing. And yet, the content that is generated from these websites remains largely untapped. In this paper, we demonstrate how social media content can be used to predict real-world outcomes. In particular, we use the chatter from Twitter.com to forecast box-office revenues for movies. We show that a simple model built from the rate at which tweets are created about particular topics can outperform market-based predictors. We further demonstrate how sentiments extracted from Twitter can be further utilized to improve the forecasting power of social media.

This paper presents the architecture, operation and results obtained with the Lasso system developed in the Natural Language Processing Laboratory at SMU. The system relies on a combination of syntactic and semantic techniques, and lightweight abductive inference to find answers. The search for the answer is based on a novel form of indexing called paragraph indexing. A score of 55.5% for short answers and 64.5% for long answers was achieved. Background Finding the answer to a question by returning a small fragment of a text, where the answer actually lies, is profoundly di erent from the task of information retrieval (IR) or information extraction (IE). Current IR systems allow us to locate full documents that might contain the pertinent information, leaving it to the user to extract the answer from a ranked list of texts. In contrast, IE systems extract the information of interest, provided it has been presented in a prede ned, target representation, known as template.

Videotape has become one of the CHI community's most useful technologies: it allows us to analyze users' interactions with computers, prototype new interfaces, and present the results of our research and technical innovations to others. But video is a double-edged sword. It is often misused, however unintentionally. How can we use it well, without compromising our integrity? This paper presents actual examples of questionable videotaping practices. Next, it explains why we cannot simply borrow ethical guidelines from other professions. It concludes with a proposal for developing usable ethical guidelines for the capture, analysis and presentation of video. KEYWORDS: HCI professional issues, video editing, ethics, social computing.
