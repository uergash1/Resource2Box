Abstract \- Cited by 2070 (4 self) \- Add to MetaCart

We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7489-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7489_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 23:00:51">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=4DB579D582D842835825DD76B413D7A9?doi=10.1.1.101.8745&amp;rank=10</link><title>Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection</title><description>Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection

Abstract \- Cited by 1670 (6 self) \- Add to MetaCart

We study the question of feature sets for robust visual object recognition, adopting linear SVM based human detection as a test case. After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds. 1</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
