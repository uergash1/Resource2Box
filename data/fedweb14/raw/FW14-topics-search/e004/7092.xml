Relevance feedback is an automatic process, introduced over 20 years ago, designed to produce improved query formulations following an initial retrieval operation. The principal relevance feedback methods described over the years are examined briefly, and evaluation data are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the various methods. Prescriptions are given for conducting text re-trieval operations iteratively using relevance feedback. Introduction to Relevance Feedback It is well known that the original query formulation process is not transparent to most information system users. In particular, without detailed knowledge of the collection make-up, and of the retrieval environment, most users find</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7092-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7092_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:21:45">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=B635B2E003341D36B792ABB6E5DF2AF6?doi=10.1.1.46.7843&amp;rank=10</link><title>Hierarchical Models of Object Recognition in Cortex</title><description>Hierarchical Models of Object Recognition in Cortex
