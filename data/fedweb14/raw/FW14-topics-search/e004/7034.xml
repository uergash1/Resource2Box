Measured Loading Speed of Maxim's Serial Interface Software Abstract: This application article presents the three-wire bus speed generated by Maxim software running on various personal computers. Processor speeds tested ranged from 233MHz to 933MHz. Windows 95 and Windows 98 operating systems were used. The parallel printer port of the PC is monitored with a logic analyzer to capture the serial bus transmissions. The 24-bit register of the MAX2361 is loaded in 204µs to 118.4µs, depending on the operating system and the processor clock frequency.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7034-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7034_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 19:02:14">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=51A5CD7555CC5169A776CE97A8EB87EF?doi=10.1.1.11.8482&amp;rank=3</link><title>Dynamic Power Management for Portable Systems</title><description>Dynamic Power Management for Portable Systems

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

This paper presents an interactive system for designing and browsing volumetric illustrations. Volumetric illustrations are 3D models with internal textures that the user can browse by cutting the models at desired locations. To assign internal textures to a surface mesh, the designer cuts the mesh and provides simple guiding information to specify the correspondence between the cross-section and a reference 2D image. The guiding information is stored with the geometry and used during the synthesis of cross-sectional textures. The key idea is to synthesize a plausible cross-sectional image using a 2D texturesynthesis technique, instead of sampling from a complete 3D RGB volumetric representation directly. This simplifies the design interface and reduces the amount of data, making it possible for non-experts to rapidly design and use volumetric illustrations. We believe that our system can enrich human communications in various domains, such as medicine, biology, and geology.

Under the three-year Video Surveillance and Monitoring (VSAM) project (1997--1999), the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Sarnoff Corporation developed a system for autonomous Video Surveillance and Monitoring. The technical approach uses multiple, cooperative video sensors to provide continuous coverage of people and vehicles in a cluttered environment. This final report presents an overview of the system, and of the technical accomplishments that have been achieved. c fl2000 Carnegie Mellon University This work was funded by the DARPA Image Understanding under contract DAAB07-97-C-J031, and by the Office of Naval Research under grant N00014-99-1-0646. 1 Introduction The thrust of CMU research under the DARPA Video Surveillance and Monitoring (VSAM) project is cooperative multi-sensor surveillance to support battlefield awareness [17].

A large portion of the power budget in server environments goes into the I/O subsystem- the disk array in particular. Traditional approaches to disk power management involve completely stopping the disk rotation, which can take a considerable amount of time, making them less useful in cases where idle times between disk requests may not be long enough to outweigh the overheads. This paper presents a new approach called DRPM to modulate disk speed (RPM) dynamically, and gives a practical implementation to exploit this mechanism. Extensive simulations with different workload and hardware parameters show that DRPM can provide significant energy savings without compromising much on performance. This paper also discusses practical issues when implementing DRPM on server disks.

Limiting the energy consumption of computers, especially portables, is becoming increasingly important. Thus, new energy-saving computer components and architectures have been and continue to be developed. Many architectural features have both high-performance and low-power modes, with the mode selection under software control. The problem is to minimize energy consumption while not significantly impacting the effective performance. We group the software control issues as follows: transition, load-change, and adaptation. The transition problem is deciding when to switch to low-power, reduced-functionality modes. The load-change problem is determining how to modify the load on a component so that it can make further use of its low-power modes. The adaptation problem is determining how to create software that allows components to be used in novel, power-saving ways. We survey implemented and proposed solutions to software energy management issues created by existing and suggested hardware innovations.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
