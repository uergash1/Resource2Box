Abstract \- Cited by 2307 (59 self) \- Add to MetaCart

In the first part of the paper we consider the problem of dynamically apportioning resources among a set of options in a worst-case on-line framework. The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weightupdate rule of Littlestone and Warmuth [20] can be adapted to this model yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games and prediction of points in R n . In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7440-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7440_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 03:05:19">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1265E8C3F549072574C5B5CA0A95255A?doi=10.1.1.204.5398&amp;rank=3</link><title>Barcelona</title><description>Barcelona

Abstract \- Cited by 431 (33 self) \- Add to MetaCart

In recent years research in the planning community has moved increasingly towards application of planners to realistic problems involving both time and many types of resources. For example, interest in planning demonstrated by the space research community has inspired work in observation scheduling, planetary rover exploration and spacecraft control domains. Other temporal and resource-intensive domains including logistics planning, plant control and manufacturing have also helped to focus the community on the modelling and reasoning issues that must be confronted to make planning technology meet the challenges of application. The International Planning Competitions have acted as an important motivating force behind the progress that has been made in planning since 1998. The third competition (held in 2002) set the planning community the challenge of handling time and numeric resources. This necessitated the development of a modelling language capable of expressing temporal and numeric properties of planning domains. In this paper we describe the language, pddl2.1, that was used in the competition. We describe the syntax of the language, its formal semantics and the validation of concurrent plans. We observe that pddl2.1 has considerable modelling power — exceeding the capabilities of current planning technology — and presents a number of important challenges to the research community.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7440-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7440_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 03:11:37">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1265E8C3F549072574C5B5CA0A95255A?doi=10.1.1.149.1065&amp;rank=5</link><title>Madrid</title><description>Madrid

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

The formation of the currency union reduces transaction costs thereby incresing interregional trade links, changing the centrality of regions relative to other regions, and increasing (price) competition between regions. Each of these lines of influence affects the interregional division of labour, i.e., the industrial specialisation of regions. In an opposite direction, industrial specialisation of regions itself may significantly affect the susceptibility of regions to region-specific shocks, and the centre-periphery differential of regional incomes. It is influenced considerably by the integration process, and it determines what the results of this process on regions are. However, it is not yet clear what exactly will be the results of EMU with respect to specialisation since theoretical considerations (particularly on the base of the “new economic geography”) lead to rather contradicting predictions and empirical evidence on the process of European integration so far is sparse and inconclusive. unknown.rtf 03/07/00 8:412 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7440-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7440_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 03:24:21">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=1265E8C3F549072574C5B5CA0A95255A?doi=10.1.1.167.6393&amp;rank=10</link><title>Barcelona</title><description>Barcelona
