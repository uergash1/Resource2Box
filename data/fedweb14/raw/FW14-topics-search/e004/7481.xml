Emerging high-performance applications require the ability to exploit diverse, geographically distributed resources. These applications use high-speed networks to integrate supercomputers, large databases, archival storage devices, advanced visualization devices, and/or scientific instruments to form networked virtual supercomputers or metacomputers. While the physical infrastructure to build such systems is becoming widespread, the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the metacomputing environment poses new challenges for developers of system software, parallel tools, and applications. In this article, we introduce Globus, a system that we are developing to address these challenges. The Globus system is intended to achieve a vertically integrated treatment of application, middleware, and network. A low-level toolkit provides basic mechanisms such as communication, authentication, network information, and data access. These mechanisms are used to construct various higher-level metacomp...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7481-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7481_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:31:15">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CB8870F339D4CBE3336EEDC7ED15338D?doi=10.1.1.194.8080&amp;rank=2</link><title>Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure</title><description>Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure

This paper integrates elements from the theory of agency, the theory of property rights and the theory of finance to develop a theory of the ownership structure of the firm. We define the concept of agency costs, show its relationship to the ‘separation and control’ issue, investigate the nature of the agency costs generated by the existence of debt and outside equity, demonstrate who bears costs and why, and investigate the Pareto optimality of their existence. We also provide a new definition of the firm, and show how our analysis of the factors influencing the creation and issuance of debt and equity claims is a special case of the supply side of the completeness of markets problem.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7481-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7481_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:34:12">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CB8870F339D4CBE3336EEDC7ED15338D?doi=10.1.1.17.7596&amp;rank=3</link><title>The Pfam Protein Families Database</title><description>The Pfam Protein Families Database

Pfam is a large collection of protein multiple sequence alignments and profile hidden Markov models. Pfam is available on the WWW in the UK at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/ , in Sweden at http://www.cgr.ki.se/Pfam/ and in the US at http:// pfam.wustl.edu/ . The latest version (4.3) of Pfam contains 1815 families. These Pfam families match 63% of proteins in SWISS-PROT 37 and TrEMBL 9. For complete genomes Pfam currently matches up to half of the proteins. Genomic DNA can be directly searched against the Pfam library using the Wise2 package.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7481-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7481_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:36:24">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CB8870F339D4CBE3336EEDC7ED15338D?doi=10.1.1.11.4846&amp;rank=4</link><title>The EigenTrust Algorithm for Reputation Management in P2P Networks</title><description>The EigenTrust Algorithm for Reputation Management in P2P Networks

Peer-to-peer file-sharing networks are currently receiving much attention as a means of sharing and distributing information. However, as recent experience with P2P networks such as Gnutella shows, the anonymous, open nature of these networks offers an almost ideal environment for the spread of self-replicating inauthentic files.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7481-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7481_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:37:58">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CB8870F339D4CBE3336EEDC7ED15338D?doi=10.1.1.393.8917&amp;rank=5</link><title>Being There -- Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again</title><description>Being There -- Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again

This paper analyzes the survival of organizations in which decision agents do not bear a major share of the wealth effects of their decisions. This is what the literature on large corporations calls separation of “ownership ” and “control.” Such separation of decision and risk bearing functions is also common to organizations like large professional partnerships, financial mutuals and nonprofits. We contend that separation of decision and risk bearing functions survives in these organizations in part because of the benefits of specialization of management and risk bearing but also because of an effective common approach to controlling the implied agency problems. In particular, the contract structures of all these organizations separate the ratification and monitoring of decisions from the initiation and implementation of the decisions.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7481-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7481_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:42:36">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CB8870F339D4CBE3336EEDC7ED15338D?doi=10.1.1.135.502&amp;rank=7</link><title>On the Self-similar Nature of Ethernet Traffic (Extended Version)</title><description>On the Self-similar Nature of Ethernet Traffic (Extended Version)

We demonstrate that Ethernet LAN traffic is statistically self-similar, that none of the commonly used traffic models is able to capture this fractal-like behavior, that such behavior has serious implications for the design, control, and analysis of high-speed, cell-based networks, and that aggregating streams of such traffic typically intensifies the self-similarity (“burstiness”) instead of smoothing it. Our conclusions are supported by a rigorous statistical analysis of hundreds of millions of high quality Ethernet traffic measurements collected between 1989 and 1992, coupled with a discussion of the underlying mathematical and statistical properties of self-similarity and their relationship with actual network behavior. We also present traffic models based on self-similar stochastic processes that provide simple, accurate, and realistic descriptions of traffic scenarios expected during B-ISDN deployment.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7481-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7481_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:45:29">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CB8870F339D4CBE3336EEDC7ED15338D?doi=10.1.1.122.7284&amp;rank=8</link><title>The structure and function of complex networks</title><description>The structure and function of complex networks

Inspired by empirical studies of networked systems such as the Internet, social networks, and biological networks, researchers have in recent years developed a variety of techniques and models to help us understand or predict the behavior of these systems. Here we review developments in this field, including such concepts as the small-world effect, degree distributions, clustering, network correlations, random graph models, models of network growth and preferential attachment, and dynamical processes taking place on networks.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7481-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7481_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:46:50">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CB8870F339D4CBE3336EEDC7ED15338D?doi=10.1.1.104.3739&amp;rank=9</link><title>Using collaborative filtering to weave an information tapestry</title><description>Using collaborative filtering to weave an information tapestry

predicated on the belief that information filtering can be more effective when humans are involved in the filtering process. Tapestry was designed to support both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering, which entails people collaborating to help each other perform filtering by recording their reactions to documents they read. The reactions are called annotations; they can be accessed by other people’s filters. Tapestry is intended to handle any incoming stream of electronic documents and serves both as a mail filter and repository; its components are the indexer, document store, annotation store, filterer, little box, remailer, appraiser and reader/browser. Tapestry’s client/server architecture, its various components, and the Tapestry query language are described.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7481-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7481_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:50:05">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=CB8870F339D4CBE3336EEDC7ED15338D?doi=10.1.1.307.8389&amp;rank=10</link><title>Dynamic taint analysis for automatic detection, analysis, and signature generation of exploits on commodity software</title><description>Dynamic taint analysis for automatic detection, analysis, and signature generation of exploits on commodity software
