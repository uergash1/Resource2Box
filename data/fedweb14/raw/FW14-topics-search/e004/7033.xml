Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

Multi-product firms have to simultaneously decide on the composition and on the location of the products inside their portfolios. Therefore, each product faces two kinds of competition that influence its survival: first, from substitutes produced by other firms (competition); and second, from other products of the same firm (cannibalization). In the Portuguese pharmaceutical market, firms have been having the possibility of transforming a branded drug into a generic drug since 2003. This enables a more complete analysis of the product life cycle in the context of multi-product firms, taking this transformation and the consequent extension of the life of the product as an alternative to exit from the market. The aim of this work is then to analyze why firms decide to turn a branded drug into a generic and how this transformation changes the product life cycle. We observe that despite the possibility of transformation, the average rate of exit did not diminish after 2003. We verify that, more than the number of competing products, it is the type and number of products of the same firm that have an important effect on “death ” rates, measured both as transformation and exit. We show that different regulatory measures on prices, co-payments, and selling rules, when fully integrated, have an important impact on the exit rates.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7033-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7033_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 18:50:47">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=13DC8BDBD79963F89ACE57107CBDDD39?doi=10.1.1.378.4211&amp;rank=2</link><title>Porto Firme</title><description>Porto Firme

In terms of the stock exchange returns, we compute the analytic expression ofthe probability distributions FDAX,+ and FDAX, − ofthe normalized positive and negative DAX (Germany) index daily returns r(t). Furthermore, we define the α re-scaled DAX daily index positive returns r(t) α and negative returns (−r(t)) α that we call, after normalization, the α positive fluctuations and α negative fluctuations. We use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test, as a method, to find the values of α that optimize the data collapse of the histogram of the α fluctuations with the Bramwell-Holdsworth-Pinton (BHP) probability density function. The optimal parameters that we found are α + = 0.50 and α − = 0.48. Since the BHP probability density function appears in several other dissimilar phenomena, our results reveal universality in the stock exchange markets.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7033-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7033_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 18:53:45">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=13DC8BDBD79963F89ACE57107CBDDD39?doi=10.1.1.416.7959&amp;rank=5</link><title>INESC Porto</title><description>INESC Porto

Abstract: − It is known that on board of an aircraft exists some directly platforms which must to track a satellite or a fixed ground radio station for solving the navigation problem, or to track some mobile target to solve the guidance problem. In those systems that finally are automatic control systems (a.c.s.) usually the output value is the position. With the developing of the digital circuits appears the digital automatic control system. For these it was necessary to develop an especially family of actuators compatible with the digital data processing. In this paper a full directly platform controller on board of a B767 AWACS aircraft is illustrated. Key-Words: − automatic control system (a.c.s.), directly platform, digital actuator, servomotor. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7033-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7033_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 18:54:59">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=13DC8BDBD79963F89ACE57107CBDDD39?doi=10.1.1.195.6028&amp;rank=6</link><title>University of Porto,</title><description>University of Porto,

New perspectives arose of recently about the division of work in industry and the coordinating mechanisms thereof (Langlois and Robertson, 1995). This paper looks at the coordination of activities and division of work in industry from the industrial networks perspective. Both the notion of relationships between firms, seen as co-ordinating mechanisms (Axelsson and Easton, 1992) and joint learning devices (Håkansson, 1993) , and the notion of firms as sets of direct and indirect capabilities (Loasby, 1998a, 1998b) are used in order to characterise and contrast the trajectories (development paths) of four firms from the Portuguese industry of moulds for plastic injection. 1.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7033-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7033_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 18:56:07">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=13DC8BDBD79963F89ACE57107CBDDD39?doi=10.1.1.394.1090&amp;rank=7</link><title>Guido Porto ‡</title><description>Guido Porto ‡

Preliminary draft: Comments welcome, but please do not quote without permission from the authors This paper estimates the short-run impact of an unexpected foreign trade liberalization shock on exporting firms and product-level data from a developing country. The economic environment was created when major importers such as the U.S., EU and China imposed new safeguard trade barriers in 2002 on steel imports deriving from developed countries and implicitly provided developing country exporters an unexpected preferential market access shock of up to 30 % by exempting them from the barriers. We use firm-level data to estimate the differential impact of this trade liberalization shock on Indian steel firms and the products they produce. We provide evidence that Indian firms with historic export ties to these markets responded more quickly to the changing market conditions in order to increase sales, exports and profits. Furthermore, we present evidence of hysteresis – i.e., exports continue to expand even after the termination of the preferential market access conditions via the removal of the discriminatory import restrictions. In terms of firm-level use of inputs, while the Indian firms that produce these preferenced products</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7033-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7033_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 18:57:07">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=13DC8BDBD79963F89ACE57107CBDDD39?doi=10.1.1.411.165&amp;rank=8</link><title>Guido Porto §</title><description>Guido Porto §

The objective of this paper is to estimate the potential bias in the trade policy of Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) and other countries against SSA poor households. To this end we start with a simple but well established framework (Winters et al., 2004) and propose and extension to include adjustments in labor income, associated with changes in unskilled and skilled wages. We then build indicators that capture differences in welfare changes across income levels associated with the elimination of SSA own trade protection, as well as trade protection on SSA’s export bundle by the rest of the world. Results suggest that SSA’s own trade policy is biased in favor of poor household, although it tends to generate real income losses that hurt poor households. Results are not affected by the inclusion of non-tariff measures (NTMs) in SSA, except in Malawi where trade policy becomes biased against poor households once NTMs are included. The trade policies of SSA’s trading partners tend to be biased in favor of SSA’s rich, and NTMs reinforce this bias.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7033-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7033_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 18:58:02">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=13DC8BDBD79963F89ACE57107CBDDD39?doi=10.1.1.204.4684&amp;rank=9</link><title>INESC Porto</title><description>INESC Porto

Abstract. The Adaptive Object-Model (AOM) architectural pattern has been significantly documented in literature, but there is not yet enough documentation explaining how to design and build a full AOMbased system. A AOM framework would need to address an additional number of issues that go well beyond individual software patterns. In this paper, we propose a design for a AOM framework that addresses several issues of building AOM-based systems, namely: integrity, runtime co-evolution, persistency, user-interface generation, communication and concurrency. We borrow concepts from distributed version-control systems. We show how applications based on a concrete realization of this framework, called Oghma, helps to avoid a traditional two-level domain classification, reduces accidental complexity, and directly exposes confined model evolution to the end-user. Key words: Adaptive Object-Models; Frameworks; Software Design 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7033-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7033_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 18:59:03">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=13DC8BDBD79963F89ACE57107CBDDD39?doi=10.1.1.299.1677&amp;rank=10</link><title>INESC Porto</title><description>INESC Porto

Abstract. Several approaches exist to automatically derive test cases that check the conformance of the implementation of abstract data types (ADTs) with respect to their specification. However, they lack support for the testing of implementations of ADTs defined by generic classes. In this paper, we present a novel technique to automatically derive, from specifications, unit test cases for Java generic classes that, in addition to the usual testing data, encompass implementations for the type parameters. The proposed technique relies on the use of Alloy Analyzer to find model instances for each test goal. JUnit test cases and Java implementations of the parameters are extracted from these model instances. 1</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
