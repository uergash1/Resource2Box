Although glial cells in the optic nerve head undergo a reactivation process in glaucoma, the role of glial cells during glaucomatous neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells is unknown. Using a coculture system in which retinal ganglion cells and glial cells are grown on different layers but share the same culture medium, we studied the influences of glial cells on survival of retinal ganglion cells after exposure to different stress conditions typified by simulated ischemia and elevated hydrostatic pressure. After the exposure to these stressors, we observed that glial cells secreted tumor necrosis factor- � (TNF-�) as well as other noxious agents such as nitric oxide into the coculture media and facilitated the apoptotic death of retinal ganglion cells as assessed by morphology, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and caspase activity. The glial origin of these noxious effects was confirmed by passive transfer experiments.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7161-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7161_03.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:29:45">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=0F977FCA526BA05D6618EB3FA5BCD87F?doi=10.1.1.319.6960&amp;rank=3</link><title>Selective Cell Death of Magnocellular Vasopressin Neurons in Neurohypophysectomized Rats Following Chronic Administration of</title><description>Selective Cell Death of Magnocellular Vasopressin Neurons in Neurohypophysectomized Rats Following Chronic Administration of

Search with synonyms is a challenging problem for Web search, as it can easily cause intent drifting. In this paper, we propose a practical solution to this issue, based on co-clicked query analysis, i.e., analyzing queries leading to clicking the same documents. Evaluation results on Web search queries show that synonyms obtained from this approach considerably outperform the thesaurus based synonyms, such as WordNet, in terms of keeping search intent. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7161-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7161_06.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:30:40">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=0F977FCA526BA05D6618EB3FA5BCD87F?doi=10.1.1.177.420&amp;rank=6</link><title>Director, Assessment and Standards</title><description>Director, Assessment and Standards

Our purpose in writing this letter is to provide for your deliberations a report completed by Sierra Research using their VEHSIM model and cost data developed by Martec. The objective of the report is to determine the expected changes in vehicle design and price associated with meeting the new CAFE standards required by EISA 2007 on individual manufacturers and on a fleet average basis. Given the timing, this analysis does not specifically address the NPRM released on April 22, 2008. We intend to provide NHTSA with a supplemental analysis specifically addressing the proposed standards. In order to accomplish that objective, the following tasks were performed: 1. Developing a baseline for each of 11 manufacturers against which the design changes necessary to meet more stringent CAFE standards would be compared. 2. Developing attribute-based standards that might be adopted by the Department of Transportation. 3. Determining the incremental increase in vehicle prices associated with the deployment of design changes intended to increase CAFE levels.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7161-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7161_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 16:30:57">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=0F977FCA526BA05D6618EB3FA5BCD87F?doi=10.1.1.259.7236&amp;rank=7</link><title>Gone in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2</title><description>Gone in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2

An electronic vehicle immobilizer is an anti-theft device which prevents the engine of the vehicle from starting unless the corresponding transponder is present. Such a transponder is a passive RFID tag which is embedded in the car key and wirelessly authenticates to the vehicle. It prevents a perpetrator from hot-wiring the vehicle or starting the car by forcing the mechanical lock. Having such an immobilizer is required by law in several countries. Hitag2, introduced in 1996, is currently the most widely used transponder in the car immobilizer industry. It is used by at least 34 car makes and fitted in more than 200 different car models. Hitag2 uses a proprietary stream cipher with 48-bit keys for authentication and confidentiality.

Purpose: To develop a consistent and reproducible method in an animal model for studies of radiofrequency (RF) ablation of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods: Fifteen woodchucks were inoculated with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) to establish chronic infections. When serum �-glutamyl transpeptidase levels became elevated, the animals were evaluated with ultrasound, and, in most cases, preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to confirm tumor development. Ultimately, RF ablation of tumors was performed by using a 1-cm probe with the animal submerged in a water bath for grounding. Ablation effectiveness was evaluated with contrast-enhanced MR imaging and gross and histopathologic analysis. Results: RF ablation was performed in 15 woodchucks. Modifications were made to the initial study design to adapt methodology for the woodchuck. The last 10 of these animals were treated with a standardized protocol using a 1-cm probe that produced a consistent area of tumor necrosis (mean size of ablation, 10.2 mm � 13.1 mm) and led to no complications. Conclusions: A safe, reliable and consistent method was developed to study RF ablation of spontaneous primary HCC using chronically WHV-infected woodchucks, an animal model of hepatitis B virus–induced HCC.
