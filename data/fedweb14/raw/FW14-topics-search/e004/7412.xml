Cilk (pronounced "silk") is a C-based runtime system for multithreaded parallel programming. In this paper, we document the efficiency of the Cilk work-stealing scheduler, both empirically and analytically. We show that on real and synthetic applications, the "work" and "critical-path length" of a Cilk computation can be used to model performance accurately. Consequently, a Cilk programmer can focus on reducing the computation's work and critical-path length, insulated from load balancing and other runtime scheduling issues. We also prove that for the class of "fully strict" (well-structured) programs, the Cilk scheduler achieves space, time, and communication bounds all within a constant factor of optimal.

I use a new technique to derive a closed-form solution for the price of a European call option on an asset with stochastic volatility. The model allows arbitrary correlation between volatility and spotasset returns. I introduce stochastic interest rates and show how to apply the model to bond options and foreign currency options. Simulations show that correlation between volatility and the spot asset’s price is important for explaining return skewness and strike-price biases in the Black-Scholes (1973) model. The solution technique is based on characteristic functions and can be applied to other problems. Many plaudits have been aptly used to describe Black and Scholes ’ (1973) contribution to option pricing theory. Despite subsequent development of option theory, the original Black-Scholes formula for a European call option remains the most successful and widely used application. This formula is particularly useful because it relates the distribution of spot returns I thank Hans Knoch for computational assistance.

We describe Freenet, an adaptive peer-to-peer network application that permits the publication, replication, and retrieval of data while protecting the anonymity of both authors and readers. Freenet operates as a network of identical nodes that collectively pool their storage space to store data files and cooperate to route requests to the most likely physical location of data. No broadcast search or centralized location index is employed. Files are referred to in a location-independent manner, and are dynamically replicated in locations near requestors and deleted from locations where there is no interest. It is infeasible to discover the true origin or destination of a file passing through the network, and difficult for a node operator to determine or be held responsible for the actual physical contents of her own node.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7412-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7412_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-23 00:18:45">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=BC6175608CABD8C98F67EFE27FD25D4A?doi=10.1.1.97.3555&amp;rank=7</link><title>Where the really hard problems are</title><description>Where the really hard problems are

It is well known that for many NP-complete problems, such as K-Sat, etc., typical cases are easy to solve; so that computationally hard cases must be rare (assuming P = NP). This paper shows that NP-complete problems can be summarized by at least one &amp;quot;order parameter&amp;quot;, and that the hard problems occur at a critical value of such a parameter. This critical value separates two regions of characteristically different properties. For example, for K-colorability, the critical value separates overconstrained from underconstrained random graphs, and it marks the value at which the probability of a solution changes abruptly from near 0 to near 1. It is the high density of wellseparated almost solutions (local minima) at this boundary that cause search algorithms to &amp;quot;thrash&amp;quot;. This boundary is a type of phase transition and we show that it is preserved under mappings between problems. We show that for some P problems either there is no phase transition or it occurs for bounded N (and so bounds the cost). These results suggest a way of deciding if a problem is in P or NP and why they are different. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7412-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7412_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-23 00:19:01">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=BC6175608CABD8C98F67EFE27FD25D4A?doi=10.1.1.368.3752&amp;rank=8</link><title>The Definition of Standard ML</title><description>The Definition of Standard ML

program. The authors wish to acknowledge helpful discussions with Lancelot James and Jim Pitman and the referees for useful comments. 1 We consider problems involving groups of data, where each observation within a group is a draw from a mixture model, and where it is desirable to share mixture components between groups. We assume that the number of mixture components is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from the data. In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering property of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessar-ily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7412-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7412_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-23 00:19:31">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=BC6175608CABD8C98F67EFE27FD25D4A?doi=10.1.1.35.8613&amp;rank=10</link><title>Training Products of Experts by Minimizing Contrastive Divergence</title><description>Training Products of Experts by Minimizing Contrastive Divergence

It is possible to combine multiple probabilistic models of the same data by multiplying their probability distributions together and then renormalizing. This is a very ecient way to model high-dimensional data which simultaneously satisfies many different low-dimensional constraints because each individual expert model can focus on giving high probability to data vectors that satisfy just one of the constraints. Data vectors that satisfy this one constraint but violate other constraints will be ruled out by their low probability under the other experts. Training a product of experts appears difficult because, in addition to maximizing the probability that each individual expert assigns to the observed data, it is necessary to make the experts be as different as possible. This ensures that the product of their distributions is small which allows the renormalization to magnify the probability of the data under the product of experts model. Fortunately, if the individual experts are t...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
