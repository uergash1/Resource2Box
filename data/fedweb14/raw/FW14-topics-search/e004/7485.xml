We discuss findings from an ethnographic study of instant messaging (IM) in the workplace and its implications for media theory. We describe how instant messaging supports a variety of informal communication tasks. We document the affordances of IM that support flexible, expressive communication. We describe some unexpected uses of IM that highlight aspects of communication which are not part of current media theorizing. They pertain to communicative processes people use to connect with each other and to manage communication, rather than to information exchange. We call these processes "outeraction." We discuss how outeractional aspects of communication affect media choice and patterns of media use. Keywords Instant messaging, media theory, informal communication, computer-mediated communication, outeraction.

By informal we mean interactions that are generall...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7485-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7485_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 20:56:51">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=7683F39CF18F854419D9E5FB5143EA7D?doi=10.1.1.18.4435&amp;rank=2</link><title>Jokes and the Logic of the Cognitive Unconscious</title><description>Jokes and the Logic of the Cognitive Unconscious

This paper summarizes work over the past five years on the automated planning and generation of multisentence texts using discourse structure relations, placing it in context of ongoing efforts by Computational Linguists and Linguists to understand the structure of discourse. Based on a series of studies by the author and others, the paper describes how the orientation of generation toward communicative intentions illuminates the central structural role played by intersegment discourse relations. It outlines several facets of discourse structure relations as they are required by and used in text planners --- their nature, number, and extension to associated tasks such as sentence planning and text formatting.

This dissertation describes a number of algorithms developed to increase the robustness of automatic speech recognition systems with respect to changes in the environment. These algorithms attempt to improve the recognition accuracy of speech recognition systems when they are trained and tested in different acoustical environments, and when a desk-top microphone (rather than a close-talking microphone) is used for speech input. Without such processing, mismatches between training and testing conditions produce an unacceptable degradation in recognition accuracy.

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

Consider how one might understand the following ad, "For Sale, Parachute. Used once; never opened; small stain. " Although there are no explicit cues to do so, the reader naturally recruits knowledge about how and why parachutes are normally used in order to construe the listed features of this chute as being causally related to one another. Empirical support for the importance of such causal and relational information in language comprehension comes from the consistent finding that memory for short texts includes inferred material (Sanford, 1981). Further, computational considerations imply that language comprehension involves a capacity for dynamic inferencing based on general knowledge represented as frames (Lange, 1989). Invented somewhat independently by researchers in the field of linguistics (Fillmore, 1968), psycholinguistics (Sanford, 1981), artificial intelligence (Minsky, 1975), and natural language processing (Schank, 1977), frame-type data structures are often invoked to account for inferential aspects of language comprehension (Fillmore, 1982). As used here, frames are representations with slot/filler structure, default values, and weak constraints on the type of fillers for a given slot ( reviewed in Barsalou, 1992).</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7485-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7485_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 21:15:15">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=7683F39CF18F854419D9E5FB5143EA7D?doi=10.1.1.203.1134&amp;rank=8</link><title>Bachelor of Science in Radiologic Sciences</title><description>Bachelor of Science in Radiologic Sciences

Abstract \- Add to MetaCart

Humans can only just recognize images with a geometric resolution of 32 × 32 pixels. However, this fact does not mean that it is also possible to assign predefined scene category labels like indoor, outdoor, kitchen or beach to such a tiny image, neither for humans nor for computers. The purpose of our work is to investigate the applicability of common scene categorization methods and the importance of color for different resolutions. We introduce a novel, challenging database of tiny images for 20 natural scene categories and present experimental results on human categorization performance. Using an algorithm based on color histograms and structure from five regions of the image, we achieve a recall rate of 46 % which significantly outperforms human recall of 30 % on 32×32 images. This work highlights specific properties of low resolution thumbnails and encourages future research within this area as an important preprocessing step to model context in object recognition.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
