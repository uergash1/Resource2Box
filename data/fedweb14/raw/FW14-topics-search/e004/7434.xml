Inferring scene geometry and camera motion from a stream of images is possible in principle, but is an ill-conditioned problem when the objects are distant with respect to their size. We have developed a factorization method that can overcome this difficulty by recovering shape and motion under orthography without computing depth as an intermediate step. An image stream can be represented by the 2FxP measurement matrix of the image coordinates of P points tracked through F frames. We show that under orthographic projection this matrix is of rank 3. Based on this observation, the factorization method uses the singular-value decomposition technique to factor the measurement matrix into two matrices which represent object shape and camera rotation respectively. Two of the three translation components are computed in a preprocessing stage. The method can also handle and obtain a full solution from a partially filled-in measurement matrix that may result from occlusions or tracking failures. The method gives accurate results, and does not introduce smoothing in either shape or motion. We demonstrate this with a series of experiments on laboratory and outdoor image streams, with and without occlusions. 1</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7434-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7434_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 00:47:28">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=697F37CFA5C6171A948BFBD4A3D790C8?doi=10.1.1.399.6138&amp;rank=4</link><title>Monopolistic competition and optimum product diversity</title><description>Monopolistic competition and optimum product diversity

This paper describes software that examines and reacts to an individual's changing context. Such software can promote and mediate people's interactions with devices, computers, and other people, and it can help navigate unfamiliar places. We believe that a limited amount of information covering a person's proximate environment is most important for this form of computing since the interesting part of the world around us is what we can see, hear, and touch. In this paper we define context-aware computing, and describe four categories of context-aware applications: proximate selection, automatic contextual reconfiguration, contextual information and commands, and context-triggered actions. Instances of these application types have been prototyped on the PARCTAB, a wireless, palm-sized computer.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7434-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7434_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 00:52:31">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=697F37CFA5C6171A948BFBD4A3D790C8?doi=10.1.1.99.8377&amp;rank=6</link><title>The interdisciplinary study of coordination</title><description>The interdisciplinary study of coordination

This survey characterizes an emerging research area, sometimes called coordination theory, that focuses on the interdisciplinary study of coordination. Research in this area uses and extends ideas about coordination from disciplines such as computer science, organization theory, operations research, economics, linguistics, and psychology. A key insight of the framework presented here is that coordination can be seen as the process of managing dependencies among activities. Further progress, therefore, should be possible by characterizing different kinds of dependencies and identifying the coordination processes that can be used to manage them. A variety of processes are analyzed from this perspective, and commonalities across disciplines are identified. Processes analyzed include those for managing shared resources, producer/consumer relationships, simultaneity constraints, and tank/subtask dependencies. Section 3 summarizes ways of applying a coordination perspective in three different domains: (1) understanding the effects of information technology on human organizations and markets, (2) designing cooperative work tools, and (3) designing distributed and parallel computer systems.

We present a novel statistical and variational approach to image segmentation based on a new algorithm named region competition. This algorithm is derived by minimizing a generalized Bayes/MDL criterion using the variational principle. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. Indeed the classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on grey level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions. 1 Division of Appli...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e004-7434-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e004/7434_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 00:59:26">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=697F37CFA5C6171A948BFBD4A3D790C8?doi=10.1.1.22.8990&amp;rank=8</link><title>Stochastic Perturbation Theory</title><description>Stochastic Perturbation Theory

. In this paper classical matrix perturbation theory is approached from a probabilistic point of view. The perturbed quantity is approximated by a first-order perturbation expansion, in which the perturbation is assumed to be random. This permits the computation of statistics estimating the variation in the perturbed quantity. Up to the higher-order terms that are ignored in the expansion, these statistics tend to be more realistic than perturbation bounds obtained in terms of norms. The technique is applied to a number of problems in matrix perturbation theory, including least squares and the eigenvalue problem.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a ubiquitous technique for data analysis and processing, but one which is not based upon a probability model. In this paper we demonstrate how the principal axes of a set of observed data vectors may be determined through maximum-likelihood estimation of parameters in a latent variable model closely related to factor analysis. We consider the properties of the associated likelihood function, giving an EM algorithm for estimating the principal subspace iteratively, and discuss, with illustrative examples, the advantages conveyed by this probabilistic approach to PCA.

Active networks are a novel approach to network architecture in which the switches of the network perform customized computations on the messages flowing through them. This approach is motivated by both lead user applications, which perform user-driven computation at nodes within the network today, and the emergence of mobile code technologies that make dynamic network service innovation attainable. In this paper, we discuss two approaches to the realization of active networks and provide a snapshot of the current research issues and activities. Introduction ‚Äì What Are Active Networks? In an active network, the routers or switches of the network perform customized computations on the messages flowing through them. For example, a user of an active network could send a ‚Äútrace ‚Äù program to each router and arrange for the program to be executed when their packets are processed.
