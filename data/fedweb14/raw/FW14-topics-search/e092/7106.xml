Download the supporting PDF file for this episode http://bit.ly/mpbROh from the Learning to Teach Online project website.This case study examines how technology can be used to support an active learning strategy within face-to-face Chemistry classes. Both in-class polling software and online lectures are used as part of a comprehensive teaching strategy, designed to enable students to develop critical thinking and analytical skills. While in-class polling is not an online process, it is included within this case study to highlight how different types of technology can be used together to effectively support classroom teaching, when integrated with a carefully considered pedagogical approach.What do you think of this resource?

Students will gather data and graph the results. Lake Norman Elementary's student population has a wide range of native states. Many of the students were born in states other than North Carolina. This activity allows the students to survey each class to see what states are represented in our school. After the survey results have been tallied, students will use the data to create different types of graphs. The class will then compare the graphs and will decide which type of graph represents the information most clearly. (less)

This lesson is part of an interdisciplinary integrated unit on DNA and genetics. The idea is for students to complete a week's worth of activities in science, math, and language arts. This lesson is Part B: Math. Students will complete a math survey interviewing people on whether they believe humans should or should not be cloned. They will take the data they gather and create computer generated spreadsheets, charts/graphs. Using the charts/graphs, students will answer mathematical percent and ratio questions and write a final journal entry on the information they collected and discovered. (less)
