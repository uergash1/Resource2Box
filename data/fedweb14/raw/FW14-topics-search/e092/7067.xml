Download the supporting PDF file for this episode http://bit.ly/f1v3iH from the Learning to Teach Online project website.This case study examines the use of eBooks and eReaders as an extension of the usual Blackboard Learning Management System (LMS). This initiative was undertaken as part of the DUCKLING research project (Delivering University Curricula: Knowledge, Learning and Innovation Gains) conducted by the Beyond Distance Research Alliance at the University of Leicester in the UK.While the context of this study involves distance students, using electronic books can have applications in any discipline where students are required to undertake a significant amount of reading.
