"People have been eating rice for over 4,000 years. It originated in Southeast Asia, and Spanish explorers brought it to the West Indies at least 500 years ago. Today, 8,000 varieties of rice are grown throughout the world. About 15 varieties are grown in the U.S." (Who Belongs Here?: An American Story by Margy Burns Knight) Because we have a strong Southeast Asian student population in the Butler Middle School in Lowell, this unit will focus on Cambodia to drive the question: "What can we learn about rice from the Five Themes of Geography?"Each lesson will revolve around one of the five themes of geography (Location, Place, Region, Movement, and Human Environmental Interaction.) In the sixth lesson, students make cookbooks of rice recipes from Cambodia and other countries from our student population. (less)
