Christy George reports that James Kelly (Boston City Council) objects to an interfaith, interracial prayer service to be held in South Boston because he fears that the meeting could be seen as an endorsement of the city's plan to integrate South Boston housing projects. George notes that Kelly has called for the meeting to be moved to another location. George's report includes footage from an interview with Father Thomas McDonnell (St. Augustine's Church in South Boston) and Reverend John Borders (Morningstar Baptist Church). McDonnell and Borders say that South Boston is not a racist neighborhood. George's report also includes footage from an interview with Kelly. George quotes Kelly as saying that he opposes forced busing, racial quotas, and forced housing. George reports that community leaders have met with Ray Flynn (Mayor of Boston) to discuss the peaceful integration of public housing projects. George's report includes footage of community leaders at a press conference. Doris Bunte (Boston Housing Authority), Charles Stith (Union United Methodist Church), John O'Bryant (Boston School Committee),and Don Muhammad (Nation of Islam, Roxbury) speak at the press conference. George reports that Bernard Cardinal Law (Archdiocese of Boston) endorses the meeting. George notes that Flynn is pushing for housing integration over the objections of South Boston residents. George's report includes footage of Flynn at a community meeting in South Boston and footage of anti-busing activity in South Boston in 1977. (less)
