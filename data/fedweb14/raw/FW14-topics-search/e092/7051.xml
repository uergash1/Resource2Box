In this activity, learners explore how dinosaurs are named and what their names mean. Learners listen to "The Littlest Dinosaurs" by Bernard Most. Then, learners brainstorm dinosaur names and discover that names are often based on body parts (i.e. rhino means nose). Learners also create drawings of dinosaurs and their body parts in their Dino Diary. This activity is featured on page 10 of the "Dinosphere" unit of study for K-2 learners. (less)

In this activity, learners explore the etymology of dinosaur names. Learners first discuss how dinosaurs are often named after a body part or behavior, where they were found, or a person (finder or famous). Learners also discuss Greek and Latin prefixes and suffixes that are commonly found in dinosaur names. Then, learners create a paper puzzle that generates new dinosaur names. This activity is featured on pp.20-27 (part of a lesson that begins on p.19) of the "Dinosphere" unit of study for grades 3-5. (less)

This lesson will go beyond naming dinosaurs and give students a broad understanding of how we know about the great beasts. This lesson focuses on what we have learned and can learn from fossils. The follow-up lesson, Dinosaurs Fossils - Uncovering the Facts, explores what information can be discerned by comparing fossils to living organisms. (less)

Last month, paleontologists from Canada, the U.S., and Japan announced an exciting discovery: feathered dinosaur fossils in North America. When Ornithomimus edmontonicus was first studied in the 1930s, its ostrich-like skeleton earned it a name that translates to "bird mimic." Now new fossils and a re-evaluation of old ones have revealed that its body covering also fits the moniker. A newly unearthed, year-old juvenile specimen is covered in downy, hair-like feathers, and re-examination of an adult specimen turned up traces of standard feathers with a central shaft. While most popular reporting has focused on the idea that these shafted feathers may have been used to attract mates, the real news in this research lies elsewhere (less)

In this activity (located on page 2 of PDF), learners sing together a song that gives details about the dinosaur species Suchomimus (pronounced ŰĎSook-o-mime-usŰ). The song is sung to the tune of "Old MacDonald Had a Farm." After singing the song, learners discuss the new facts they've learned about the dinosaur species and make a list of its physical characteristics. (less)
