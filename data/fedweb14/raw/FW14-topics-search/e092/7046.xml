In this activity, learners use a tuning fork to explore how the Doppler effect works. They strike the tuning fork to produce a sound, then observe as the tone changes as the fork is swung back and forth. Learners also explore applications of the Doppler effect in technology. (less)

Students examine images of galaxies and learn to recognize the various shapes used in the Hubble classification system. They can follow the site independently, using a worksheet that prompts them to answer questions in the text, then take a java "quiz" that requires them to place various galaxies in their correct positions on the Hubble "tuning fork." There is some supplemental material about galaxies and Hubble's observations. (less)
