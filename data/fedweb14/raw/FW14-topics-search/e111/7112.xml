'I think it will be a long road,' she told the audience. 'We believe that the phone will get reorganized around peopleâ€”Home is the first iteration of that.' But Home could require a good deal of tweaking, at least if user feedback is any sort of indication.

This project used the Nmap Scripting Engine, which is capable of performing discovery, vulnerability detection, and anything else you can imagine with lightning speed. We saw last month how an Nmap developer downloaded 170 million Facebook names, and this month it's a million favicons; I wonder what they'll do next?"</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
