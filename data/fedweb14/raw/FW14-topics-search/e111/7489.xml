Jon says: "Hannibal is only disappointing in that it's a good movie that could have been great. Hannibal himself is terrific, a true monster for the ages, but this Clarice is more like Agent Scully pursuing a meta-psycho. But what a goofy country: Sex will draw an NC-17 rating, but you can rip somebody's face off and feed it to the dogs and get an R. Don't bring little kids or squeamish friends to this movie: some of the violence is truly disgusting. Spoilage warning: Plot and gory details are discussed but ending and outcomes are not given away." (Read on for more of Jon's view and all of timothy's as well.)</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
