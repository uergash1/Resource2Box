LWJGL provides developers access to high performance crossplatform libraries such as OpenGL (Open Graphics Library), OpenCL (Open Computing Language) and OpenAL (Open Audio Library) allowing for state of the art 3D games and 3D sound. Additionally LWJGL provides access to controllers such as Gamepads, Steering wheel and Joysticks. All in a simple and straight forward API. LWJGL is available under a BSD license, which means it's open source and freely available at no charge.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e158-7426-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e158/7426_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 12:44:21">http://sourceforge.net/projects/game-editor/?source=directory</link><title>Game Editor</title><description>Game Editor is the game design software that gives you the power to create the games of your dreams, and gives you the chance to get the source code of the game creator and develop 2D games for personal computers as well as mobile devices like iPhone</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e158-7426-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e158/7426_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 12:44:56">http://sourceforge.net/projects/enigma-game/?source=directory</link><title>Enigma</title><description>Enigma is a puzzle game</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e158-7426-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e158/7426_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 12:45:50">http://sourceforge.net/projects/flare-game/?source=directory</link><title>flare-game</title><description>Action RPG that's easy to mod</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e158-7426-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e158/7426_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 12:46:29">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bmxlib/?source=directory</link><title>bmx</title><description>Library and utilities to read and write broadcasting media files.
