I have fully updated this project and I hope you will find it useful. Please try it out and rate this application. In short the project allows you to track cell phones periodically. For instance every minute or every five minutes. You can watch the cell phone being tracked in real time and you can store and reload routes easily. You have the choice of two server stacks. Either using asp.net and sql server or using php and mysql. Historically, devs have downloaded the asp.net server project 2 to 1 over the php project. I have included both now in the same download but you only need to use one.

A small printed circuit board is mounted atop each cell, which performs bypassing and monitors for high or low cell voltage or temperature. This design has been optimised for high voltage isolation, to withstand high forward and reverse voltages under fault conditions without creating arcs that could ignite flammable vapour, for autonomous operation, to use fibre optics for comms, not to require physical access for reset or firmware update, and to have low cost.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e158-7215-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e158/7215_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 14:58:52">http://sourceforge.net/projects/csml/?source=directory</link><title>Cell System Markup Language(CSML)Project</title><description>The Cell System Markup Language (CSML) is an XML format for modeling, visualizing and simulating biopathways.
