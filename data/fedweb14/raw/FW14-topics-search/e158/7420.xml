LWJGL provides developers access to high performance crossplatform libraries such as OpenGL (Open Graphics Library), OpenCL (Open Computing Language) and OpenAL (Open Audio Library) allowing for state of the art 3D games and 3D sound. Additionally LWJGL provides access to controllers such as Gamepads, Steering wheel and Joysticks. All in a simple and straight forward API. LWJGL is available under a BSD license, which means it's open source and freely available at no charge.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e158-7420-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e158/7420_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 12:08:42">http://sourceforge.net/projects/iphoneanalyzer/?source=directory</link><title>IPhone Analyzer</title><description>IOS6 and recent iTunes updates have broken a few features. We have made some partial fixes, but they are not complete. If you'd like to help support our development, or take over the development please let us know. Explore the internal file structure of your iphone (or of a seized phone in the case of forensic teams) using either the iphone's own backup files or (for jail broken iphones) ssh. Viewing of plist, sqlite, and hex are supported. IOS 5 is now supported iOS 6 only partially works at the moment (some features fail or are missing). Unfortunately paid work means we can't fix this right now, but would welcome anyone else submitting patches.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e158-7420-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e158/7420_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 12:09:18">http://sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/?source=directory</link><title>Allegro game programming library</title><description>Allegro is a cross-platform library intended for use in computer games and other types of multimedia programming.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e158-7420-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e158/7420_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 12:09:56">http://sourceforge.net/projects/flare-game/?source=directory</link><title>flare-game</title><description>Action RPG that's easy to mod</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
