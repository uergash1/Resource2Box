Pathology: Squamous Cell Carcinoma \- Squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) is a malignancy of the squamous epithelial cells.Because epithelium is uniquely derived from each of the primary germ layers and is totipotential, epithelial cell malignancy can demonstrate more than one cell type. Basisquamous, mucoepidermoid, junctional (spindle cell/squamous cell), and mixed small-cell and large-cell cancers are well known. A poorly differentiated carcinoma can demonstrate all the elements. With metaplasia, glandular epithelial cells can become squamous and malignant (SCCA).A number of other ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e068-7215-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e068/7215_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:05:52">http://emedicine.medscape.com/?urlCache=aHR0cDovL2VtZWRpY2luZS5tZWRzY2FwZS5jb20vaG9tZQ==&amp;cookieCheck=1</link><title>Squamous Cell Carcinoma : Article by Glenn Goldman, MD</title><description>Squamous Cell Carcinoma : Article by Glenn Goldman, MD 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma \- Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common form of skin cancer and frequently arises on the sun-exposed skin of the middle aged and elderly. SCC is much more common in areas with a high incidence of sun exposure (Picture 1). Most SCC are readily identified and removed in the physician's office as a minor surgical procedure. Larger more aggressive lesions may require aggressive surgical management and/or radiation therapy. High-risk SCC has a ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e068-7215-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e068/7215_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:06:29">http://emedicine.medscape.com/?urlCache=aHR0cDovL2VtZWRpY2luZS5tZWRzY2FwZS5jb20vaG9tZQ==&amp;cookieCheck=1</link><title>Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Conjunctival : Article by Robert M Dryden, MD, FACS</title><description>Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Conjunctival : Article by Robert M Dryden, MD, FACS 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Conjunctival - Squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva is a malignant epithelial neoplasm characterized by basement membrane invasion or distant metastasis. Epithelial tumors of the conjunctiva are similar to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).Squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva represents a form of conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia that has either broken through the basement membrane to involve the subepithelial tissue or has metastasized. Morbidity is related primarily to local involvement of the conjunctiva and cornea, although regional spread and ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e068-7215-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e068/7215_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:07:47">http://www.skinsite.com/info_squamous_cell_carcinoma.htm</link><title>Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin - Skin Cancer</title><description>Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin - Skin Cancer 
A squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is a form of skin cancer which is usually the result of long term sun damage to the skin. Squamous cell carcinomas enlarge slowly and steadily and can invade neighboring tissue, like the eye. They can also spread to distant parts of the body (metastasize) if not treated early. The only way to tell for sure if a skin growth is cancerous is to biopsy it. This involves removing a small piece of the skin and having a pathologist look at it under the microscope in a medical laboratory. A biopsy does not remove the cancer, it only takes off the very top (like the tip of an iceberg). Sometimes the skin will heal after the biopsy because it grows over the cancer. This does not mean the cancer is gone, it means the cancer is now covered with a blanket of skin. If the cancer is not removed completely it can go deep into the skin and metastasize to the internal organs causing death.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e068-7215-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e068/7215_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:08:36">http://emedicine.medscape.com/?urlCache=aHR0cDovL2VtZWRpY2luZS5tZWRzY2FwZS5jb20vaG9tZQ==&amp;cookieCheck=1</link><title>Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Eyelid : Article by Michael T Yen, MD</title><description>Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Eyelid : Article by Michael T Yen, MD 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Eyelid - Squamous cell carcinoma of eyelid is a relatively rare malignant epithelial tumor that typically affects elderly fair-skinned individuals. Certain benign and malignant epithelial tumors may simulate squamous cell carcinoma both clinically and histopathologically; earlier studies may have overestimated the frequency of squamous cell carcinoma.Although not nearly as common as basal cell carcinoma of the eyelids, previous studies have found it to be the second or third most common eyelid malignancy, accounting for approximately 5% of ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e068-7215-07"><link>http://www.healthlinks.net/cgi-bin/directory/hyperseek.cgi?ID=1034363808</link><title>Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Reducing Postoperative Radiotherapy Treatment Time</title><description>Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Reducing Postoperative Radiotherapy Treatment Time

Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin - Skin cancers are the most common forms of cancer. The age-adjusted incidence in the Pacific Northwest is 100 per 100,000 cancer cases. In Australia, the age-adjusted incidence is 166 per 100,000 cancer cases. Basal cell cancers account for nearly two thirds of skin cancer cases, while squamous cell cancers account for 10% of skin cancers. Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCAs) occur more commonly on the pinna of the ear than basal cell carcinomas. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e068-7215-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e068/7215_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:10:54">http://www.intelihealth.com/home</link><title>Squamous Cell Carcinoma Of The Lung</title><description>Squamous Cell Carcinoma Of The Lung
