Theme: Dinner Parties 
(Blame it on +Kimberly Chapman's post here: 
https://plus.google.com/u/0/108316670838828910396/posts/F18sat2Gx2q 
(As a side note/question:  Would you be interested in a dinner party service for singles as a way to meet over the joy of cooking?  Would you pay for such a service?) 

Rules for this round: 
1) Video Tennis comprises of a series of responses between all players written in or composed of YouTube links, fitting the theme of the particular round of Video Tennis. 
2) You can call bullsheet on another player if you feel they're bluffing, or violating the theme in some way, or provided an inadequate response to your own serve. 
3) Trash talk is encouraged, as long as it is all kept in good fun. This is a playful game. The minute you get serious about it, you're out. 
4) The game ends when this post hits 500 responses. 

Special Rules: 
For this round of Video Tennis you must also: 
5) &lt;del&gt;Write your responses almost entirely out of links. Artists' names, "blah blah remix", "Feat. whositsbob", etc. will not count as part of your sentence. You will be allowed 1 unrelated word per YouTube link.&lt;/del&gt; 
&lt;del&gt;6) You may add in additional verbiage if it is a whole line (or multiple whole lines) from one of the included songs' lyrics.&lt;/del&gt; 
7) Your response must be plausibly related to dinner parties. Not necessarily food or set-up, but you must be able to defend it as dinner party related somehow. 
8) The YouTube link does not necessarily have to be for a song. 
9) Style and creativity &lt;del&gt;matter&lt;/del&gt; make it more fun! 

On that note, I shall start off: 
Flames on the side of my face 
My defense (you don't have to defend at the time you post your link, only if you're challenged on your link) is that Clue was one giant Mystery Dinner Party. 

The video attached to the post, however, was a result of an impromptu Birthday Dinner Party via Hangout for +Kimberly Chapman, and I promised to publish it, as much as it embarrasses me, so here you go, enjoy my drunken rendition of Happy Birthday!﻿

My wife just called me during her stopover on a flight from the East Coast. She was horrified because she sat on the plane next to a mother and her toddler (one year and nine months old). It was breakfast time, and the mother gave her child the following: 

1\. Frosted Flakes cereal (which is 25% sugar) 
2\. A Pepsi 
3\. A bag of Oreo cookies 
4\. A can of fruit cocktail in high-fructose corn syrup 
5\. A bag of M&amp;Ms 

The question is, why would a mother do this to her child? It seems to me that a mother would have to be 1) spectacularly ignorant about sugar; 2) criminally neglectful; or 3) maliciously hateful toward her child. 

Are there any other explanations?

world 

The final day of the Gregorian year 

In the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Eve (also Old Year's Day or Saint Sylvester's Day in many countries), the last day of the 
year, is on December 31. In many countries, New Year's Eve 
is celebrated at evening social gatherings, where many people dance, eat, drink 
alcoholic beverages, and watch or light fireworks to mark the new year. Some 
people attend a watchnight service.The celebrations generally go on past 
midnight into January 1 (New Year'sDay). 

The island nations of Kiribati and Samoa are the first to welcome the 
New Year while Honolulu, 
Hawaiiis among the last places twelcome the New Year. 

North America 
 Canada 
New Year traditions and celebrations in Canadavary regionally. New Year's Eve 
(also called New Year's Eve Day or Veille du Jour de l'An in French) is 
generally a social holiday. In many cities, such as Toronto and Niagara Fallsin 
Ontario, there 
are large celebrations which may feature concerts, late-night partying, sporting 
events, and fireworks, with free public transit service during peak party times 
in most major cities. In some areas, such as in rural Quebec, people ice fish 
  and drink alcoholic beverages with their friends until the early hours ofJanuary 1. 

From 1956 to 1976, Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians 
serenaded Canada on the CBC, 
via a feed from CBS, from the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Park 
Avenue in New York 
City. After Lombardo's death in 1977, the Royal Canadians 
continued on CBC and CBS until 
1978. 

In 1992, the sketch comedy troupe Royal Canadian Air 
Farce began airing its annual Year of the Farce special on CBC Television, which 
features sketches lampooning the major events and news stories of the year. 
While the original 1992 edition was a one-off special, Year of the Farce 
episodes continued as a regular feature of the Air Farce television series which 
ran from 1993 to 2008—airing its series finale on December 31, 2008. Following 
the finale of the television series, the original cast continued to participate 
in New Year's Eve specials in the years 
  following. 

Similarly, the CBC's French language network Ici 
Radio-Canada Télé airs its own yearly New Year's Eve comedy special, Bye Bye. 
Unlike Year of the Farce, Bye Bye has been presented by various comedians; 
originally running from 1968 to 1998, it was revived in 2006 by the Québécois 
troupe Rock et Belles Oreilles. Its 2008 edition, hosted and co-produced by 
Québécois television personality Véronique Cloutier, became infamous for several 
sketches that many viewers perceived as offensive, including sketches making fun 
of English Canadians and then American president-elect Barack 
Obama. 

Mexico 

Mexicans celebrate New Year's Eve, (Spanish: Vispera de 
Año Nuevo) by eating a grape with each of the twelve chimes of a clock's bell 
during the midnight countdown, while making a wish with each one. Mexican 
families decorate homes and parties in colors that represent wishes for the 
upcoming year: red encourages an overall improvement of lifestyle and love, 
yellow encourages blessings of improved employment conditions, green for 
improved financial circumstances, and white for improved health. Mexican sweet 
bread is baked with a coin or charm hidden in the dough. When the bread is 
served, the recipient of the slice with the coin or charm is said to be blessed 
with good luck in the New Year. Another tradition is to make a list of all the 
bad or unhappy events over the past 12 months; before midnight, this list is 
thrown into a fire, symbolizing the removal of negative energy from the new 
year.[7] At the same time, thanks are expressed for all the good things during 
the year that is ending so that they will continue in the new 
year. 

Mexicans celebrate with a late-night dinner with their 
families, the traditional meal being turkey and mole. Afterwards many people 
attend parties outside the home, for example, in night clubs. In Mexico  City there is a street festival on New 
Year's Eve centered around the Zocalo, the city's main square. Celebrations 
include firecrackers, fireworks and sparklers and shouts of "¡Feliz a nuevo!" 

Puerto Rico 

In Puerto Rico, NewYear's Eve is celebrated with friends and family. The Puerto Rico Convention 
Center in SanJuan is the main attraction for Puerto Ricans during the 
celebration. It has Latin music, fireworks at midnight along with the signature 
song "Auld Lang Syne" in Spanish. 

United States 

The ball drop in New York 
City's Times Square attracts a 
million spectators yearly. 

In the United States, New Year's Eve is 
celebrated with formal parties, family-oriented activities, and other large 
public events. 

One of the most prominent New Year's celebrations in the 
country is the "ball drop" held in New York 
City's Times Square. Inspired by the 
time balls that were formally used as a time signal, at 11:59 p.m. ET, a 
11,875-pound (5,386 
kg), 12-foot (3.7 
m) diameter Waterford crystal ball located on the roof of 
One Times Square is lowered down a pole that is 141 feethigh, reaching the roof of 
the building one minute later to signal the start of the New Year. The Ball Drop 
has been held since 1907, and in recent years has averaged around a million 
spectators yearly. The popularity of the spectacle also inspired similar "drop" 
events outside of New York City, which often use 
objects that represent a region's culture, geography, or history—such as 
Atlanta's "Peach Drop", representing 
Georgia's identity as the"PeachState". 

The portrayal of festivities on radio and television has 
helped ingrain certain aspects of the celebration in American pop culture; 
beginning on the radio in 1928, and on CBS television from 1956 to 1976 (which 
also included coverage of the ball drop), Guy Lombardo and his band, The Royal 
Canadians, presented an annual New Year's Eve broadcast from the ballroom of New 
York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The broadcasts were also well known for the Royal 
Canadians' signature performance of "Auld Lang Syne" at midnight, which helped 
popularize the song as a New Year's standard. After Lombardo's death in 1977, 
prominence shifted towards ABC's special Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 
(which had recently moved from NBC), originally intended by its creator and host 
Dick Clark to be a modern and youthful alternative to Lombardo's big band music. 
  Including ABC's special coverage of the year 2000, Clarkwould host New Year's Eve coverage on ABC for 
thirty-three straight years. After suffering a stroke, Clark ceded hosting duties in 2005 to talk show host Regis 
Philbin. Although Clark returned the following year, a speech impediment caused 
by the stroke prevented him from being the main host until his death in April 
2012, Clarkmade limited appearances on the show 
as a co-host, but was formally succeeded by Ryan Seacrest. 

New Year's Eve is traditionally the busiest day of the 
year at Walt Disney World Resort inFlorida and Disneyland in Anaheim, 
California, where the parks stay open late and the usual nightly fireworks are supplemented by an additional New 
Year's Eve-specific show at midnight. 

Religious observances 

In the Roman Catholic Church, January 1 is a solemnity 
honoring the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of Jesus; it is a Holy Day of 
Obligation in most countries (Australia being a notable exception), 
thus the Church requires the attendance of all Catholics in such countries for 
Mass that day. However a vigil Mass may be held on the evening before a Holy 
Day; thus it has become customary to celebrate Mass on the evening of New Year's 
Eve. (New Year's Eve is a feast day honoring Pope Sylvester I in the Roman 
Catholic calendar, but it is not widely recognized in the United 
States.) 

Many Christian congregations have New Year's Eve 
watchnight services. Some, especially Lutherans and Methodists and those in the 
African American community, have a tradition known as "Watch Night", in which 
the faithful congregate in services continuing past midnight, giving thanks for 
the blessings of the outgoing year and praying for divine favor during the 
upcoming year. In the English-speaking world, Watch Night can be traced back to 
John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, who learned the custom from the Moravian 
  Brethren who came to Englandin the 1730s. Moravian 
congregations still observe the Watch Night service on New Year's Eve. Watch 
Night took on special significance to African Americans on New Year's Eve 1862, 
as slaves anticipated the arrival of January 1, 1863, when Lincolnhad announced he 
would sign the Emancipatio Proclamation. 

Europe 

Albania 

Preparations for the New year’s eve in 
Albaniastart long before 31 December. 
It starts with the Christmas tree which in Albania is known as “New Year’s Tree” 
or ” New Year’s Pine”.On these day, 31 December, grandparents, parents, children 
and relatives are gathered together to spend some remarkable moments all 
together. Having an abundant dinner with different kinds of delicious dishes is 
also a tradition.Another part of the tradition is that of watching lot of comedy 
shows on that night, as the New Year should find people smiling and full of 
joy.The most amazing moment of the night is the last minute of The Old Year and 
the minute to come of the New Year. At 00:00 everybody toast and greet the 
others, a lot of fireworks brighten up the sky of the city. They wish each other 
a prosperous new year, full of happiness, joy, good health and lots of fortune. 
It is a tradition that at 00:00 people call each other on the phone to greet one 
another or send SMS to all their friends. 31 December is the busiest day of an 
Albanian. 

Austria 

In Austria, New Year's Eve is usually 
celebrated with friends and family. At exactly midnight, all radio and 
television programmes operated by ORF broadcast the sound of the Pummerin, the 
bell of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, followed by the Donauwalzer ("The Blue 
Danube") by Johann Strauss II. Many people dance to this at parties or in the 
street. Large crowds gather in the streets of Vienna, where the municipal government 
  organises a series of stages where bands and orchestras play. Fireworks are set 
  off by both municipal governments and 
individuals. 

Belgium 

New Year's Eve (Sint Sylvester Vooravond ("Saint 
Sylvester's Eve") or Oudjaar ("old year")) is celebrated with family parties, 
called réveillons in the French speaking areas. On television, a stand-up 
comedian reviews the past year after which a musical or variety show signals 
midnight, when everyone kisses, exchanges good luck greetings, and toasts the 
New Year and absent relatives and friends with champagne. Many people light 
fireworks or go into the street to watch them. Most cities have their own 
fireworks display: the most famous is at Mont 
des Arts in Brussels. Cities, cafés and restaurants are 
crowded. Free bus services and special New Year's Eve taxis (the Responsible 
Young Drivers) bring everyone home 
afterwards. 

On January 1 (Nieuwjaarsdag in Dutch) children read their 
"New Year's letter" and give holiday greeting cards of decorated paper featuring 
golden cherubs and angels, colored roses and ribbon-tied garlands to parents and 
godparents, on decorated paper. 

Belgian farmers also wish their animals a happy New 
Year. 

Bosnia and 
Herzegovina 

New Year is widely celebrated in Bosnia  and 
Herzegovina. Streets are decorated for New 
Year's Eve and there is a fireworks show and concerts in all the larger cities. 
Children receive gifts from adults who are dressed as Djed Mraz. Restaurants, 
clubs, cafes and hotels are usually full of guests and they organize New Year's 
Eve parties. 

In Sarajevo, people gather 
in the Square of children of Sarajevo where a local rock band entertains 
them. Several trumpet and rock groups play until the early morning hours. At 
midnight there is a big fireworks 
show. 

Czech Republic and 
Slovakia 

New Year's Eve (Silvestr/Silvester) celebrations and 
traditions in CzechRepublic 
and Slovakia are very similar. New Year's 
Eve is the noisiest day of the year. People generally gather with friends at 
parties, in pubs, clubs, in the streets, or city squares to eat, drink, and 
celebrate the new year. Fireworks are a popular tradition; in large cities such 
as Bratislava, or Prague, the fireworks start before noon and 
steadily increase until midnight. In the first minutes after midnight, people 
toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health, and 
go outside for the fireworks. 

In both countries all major TV stations air entertainment 
shows before and after the midnight countdown, which is followed by the National 
anthem of each country. The Presidents of the republics give their New Year 
speech in the morning. In recent years however the Czechoslovak national anthem 
is played at midnight, in honor of the shared history of both 
nations. 

Denmark 

People in Denmark 
may go to parties or entertain guests at home. There is a special evening meal, 
with concludes with Kransekage, a special desert, along with champagne. Other 
  traditional dishes are boiled cod, stewed kale and cured saddle of pork.[21] 
  However, expensive cuts of beef as well as sushi have become increasingly 
  popular.[22] 

Two significant traditional events are broadcast on 
television and radio on December 31: the monarch's New Year message from 
AmalienborgPalace[23] at 6pm and the Town Hall Clock in Copenhagenstriking 
midnight. Thousands of people gather together in Rådhuspladsen (the Town Hall Square) 
  and cheer.[24] The Royal Guard[25][26] parade in their red gala uniforms. The 
  climax of the celebration is fireworks launched as the Town Hall Tower bells 
  chime on the stroke of 
midnight.[27] 

England 

In England, clocks symbolize the 
transition that occurs at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. The 
celebration in London focuses on Big Ben, the 
bell and by association, the clock housed in the clock tower at the Palace of Westminster. The celebrations have been 
  televised from London by the BBC since 
1984 in 
the English regions, Wales, 
and Northern 
Ireland, it had previously televised the 
Scottish celebrations since 1936. Parties are held across the country, in pubs, 
clubs, and private houses. At the stroke of midnight, people join hands in a 
ring and sing Auld Lang Syne. 

On New Year's Eve 2010, an estimated 250,000 people 
gathered to view an eight-minute fireworks display around and above the London 
Eye which was, for the first time, set to a musical soundtrack. The soundtrack 
included songs by British artists such as Blur, The Beatles, and QueenThe 
celebrations in London continued into January 1, with the New 
Year's Day Parade, held annually since 1987. The 2011 parade involved more than 
10,000 musicians, cheerleaders and performers.[30] For the arrival of 2012, 
there were a few small changes. In addition to the fireworks going off at the 
London Eye, more fireworks went off from the Big Ben with every 
chime. 

 Other major New Year events are held in the cities of 
Birmingham,Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, and Newcastle. 

Bideford, in north Devon, is also known for its New Year's Eve celebrations, 
featuring a carnival and fancy dress. The celebration centers on Bideford's 
quayside and around its Old Bridge, with a lone piper playing Auld Lang Syne at 
midnight, followed by a fireworks 
display.[32][33] 

Estonia 

To celebrate New Year's Eve in Estonia, people decorate villages, 
visit friends and prepare lavish 
meals. 

Some believe that people should eat seven, nine, or 
twelve times on New Year's Eve. These are lucky numbers in Estonia; it is 
believed that for each meal consumed, the person gains the strength of that many 
men the following year. Meals should not be completely finished—some food should 
be left for ancestors and spirits who visit the house on New Year' s Eve. 

Traditional New Year food includes pork with sauerkraut 
or Estonian sauerkraut (mulgikapsad), baked potatoes and swedes with hog's head, 
and white and blood sausage. Vegetarians can eat potato salad with navy 
beet[clarification needed] and pâté. Gingerbread and marzipan are very popular 
for dessert. Traditional New Year drinks include beer and mead, but mulled wine 
and champagne have become modern favourites. 

Finland 

In Finland, New Year's Eve is usually 
celebrated with family or friends. Late supper is served, often featuring 
wieners, Janssonin kiusaus, and potato salad. Some municipalities organize 
fireworks at midnight. Consumer fireworks are also very popular. A Finnish 
tradition is molybdomancy - to tell the fortunes of the New Year by melting 
"tin" (actually lead) in a tiny pan on the stove and throwing it quickly in a 
bucket of cold water. The resulting blob of metal is analyzed, for example by 
interpreting shadows it casts by candlelight. These predictions are however 
never taken seriously. 

The Finnish Broadcasting Company broadcasts the reception 
of the New Year at Helsinki Senate 
Square. Countdown to New Year is with the Helsinki 
Cathedral clock. In the afternoon programme, the German comedy sketch Dinner for 
One is shown every year. On the radio, just before midnight, the poem Hymyilevä 
Apollo (Smiling Apollo) by Eino Leino is read. 

 France 

In France, New Year's Eve (la Saint-Sylvestre) is 
  usually celebrated with a feast, le Réveillon de la Saint-Sylvestre (Cap d'Any 
  in Northern Catalonia). This feast customarily 
  includes special dishes including foie gras, seafood such as oysters, and 
  champagne. The celebration can be a simple, intimate dinner with friends and 
  family or, une soirée dansante, a much fancier ball. 

On New Year's Day (le Jour de l'An) friends and family 
exchange New Year's resolutions, kisses, and wishes. Some people eat ice 
cream. 

The holiday period ends on January 6 with the celebration 
of Epiphany (Jour des Rois). A traditional type of flat pastry cake, la galette 
des rois, made of two sheets of puff pastry, filled with frangipane (almond 
paste) is eaten. The cake contains a fève, a small china doll; whomever finds it 
becomes king or queen and gets to wear a gold paper crown and choose his or her 
partner. This tradition can last up to two 
weeks. 

Germany 

In Germany, parties are common on New 
Year's Eve (Silvester). Fireworks are very popular, both with individuals and 
large municipal displays. Every year Berlin 
hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in all of Europe, 
attended by over a million people. The focal point is the Brandenburg Gate, 
where midnight fireworks are centered. Germans toast the New Year with a glass 
of Sekt (German sparkling wine) or champagne. 

Since 1972, each New Year's Eve, several German 
television stations broadcast a short comedy play in English (recorded by West 
German television in 1963) entitled Dinner for One. A line from the comedy 
sketch, "the same procedure as every year", has become a catch phrase in 
Germany. 

Bleigießen (pouring lead) is another German New Year's 
Eve custom, which involves telling fortunes by the shapes made by molten lead 
dropped into cold water. Other auspicious actions are to touch a chimney sweep 
or have him rub some ash on your forehead for good luck and health. Jam-filled 
doughnuts (called Berliner) with and without liquor fillings are eaten. Finally 
a tiny marzipan pig is consumed for more good 
luck. 

Yet another German tradition is the making of Speckdicken 
\- people go door to door visiting their neighbors and partaking in this dish. It 
looks similar to a pancake, but the recipe calls for either dark molasses or 
dark syrup, with summer sausage and bacon in the center. 

Greece 

New Year's Eve in Greecehas many 
traditions. During the day, children sing the New Year's carols to be given 
money. Then, it is time to have family lunch or dinner. In the evening, people 
cook a pie named "Bill's pie (Vassilopita locally)", which is a cake flavored 
with almonds. Following tradition, they put a coin wrapped in aluminium foil 
inside the pie. 

When midnight arrives, the families count down and then 
they turn off all the lights and reopen their eyes to "enter the year with a new 
light". After the fireworks show, they cut the "Vassilopita" and serve it. The 
person that gets the wrapped coin is the lucky person of the day. Gifts 
exchanges may follow. 

Hungary 

New Year's Eve (Szilveszter) in Hungary 
 is celebrated with home parties and street parties, including a gathering in 
  downtown Budapest. Fireworks and firecrackers are 
popular. Champagne, wine and traditional Hungarian New Year dishes—frankfurter 
sausages with horseradish, lentil soup, fish, and roast pig—are consumed.[38] 
The national anthem is commonly sung at midnight. 

In past centuries, some Hungarians believed that animals 
were able to speak on New Year's Eve, and that onion skins sprinkled with salt 
could indicate a rainy month. 

Hungarian Christian communities focus on celebrating Mass 
on both New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. 

Iceland 

Fireworks are very popular in Iceland, particularly on New Year's 
Eve. Bonfires are also very common, often accompanied by shows, musical events 
and food tables. 

Iceland's biggest New Year's Eve events are usually in and around the 
capital, Reykjavík. Most Icelanders listen to the evening radio broadcast of the 
mass at Reykjavik's cathedral.[citation needed] This is 
followed by dinner. Nightclubs in the city are very crowded and tend to stay 
open until at least 5 am. 

Áramótaskaupið ("The New Year's comedy") is an annual 
Icelandic television comedy special, that is an important part of the New Year 
for most. It focuses satirically on the past year, and shows little mercy for 
its victims, especially politicians, artists, prominent business people and 
activists. Neighbours then meet at their nearest large bonfire, while watching 
the midnight fireworks 

 Ireland 

 New Year's 
Eve (Oíche Chinn Bliana, Oíche na Coda Móire, or Oíche Chaille) celebrations in 
major cities are modest, with most people favouring small parties in the home 
for family and friends. Pubs and clubs across the country hold events on New 
Year's Eve, particularly in larger cities.[citation 
needed] 

Italy 

In Italy, New Year's Eve (Vigilia di 
Capodanno or Notte di San Silvestro) is celebrated by the observation of 
traditional rituals, such as wearing red underwear. An ancient tradition (rarely 
followed today) was disposing of old or unused items by dropping them from the 
window. 

Dinner is traditionally eaten with parents and friends. 
It often includes zampone or cotechino (a meal made with pig's trotters or 
entrails), and lentils. At 8:30 pm, the President reads a television message of 
greetings to Italians. 

At midnight, fireworks are displayed all across the 
country. A lentil stew is eaten when bell tolls midnight, one spoonful per bell. 
This is supposed to bring good fortune; the round lentils represent 
coins. 

Macedonia 

New Year's Eve is celebrated across Macedonia. New 
Year's Day is celebrated by day-long fireworks shows. The day is celebrated 
  together with family or friends at home or in restaurants, clubs, cafés and 
  hotels. During the day-time celebration children get gifts. Evening 
  celebrations include food, music, and dancing to both traditional Macedonian 
  folk music, and modern music. New Year's Eve is celebrated on December 31 and 
  also on January 14 according to the Macedonian Orthodox Calendar. New Year in 
Macedoniacelebrated as it starts the 
new year 2014.Mouth are 
displaced. 

Malta 

Malta organized its first New Year's street party in 
2009 inFloriana. The event was not highly advertised and proved controversial, due to

is completely different) (apple slice fritters).[43] On television, the main 
feature is the oudejaarsconference, a performance by one of the major Dutch 
cabaretiers (comparable to stand-up comedy, but more serious, generally 
including a satirical review of the year's politics). Historically, in Reformed 
Protestant families, Psalm 90 is read, although this tradition is now fading 
away.[44] At midnight, Glühwein (bishops wine) or Champagne is drunk. Many 
  people light their own fireworks. Towns do not organize a central fireworks

Russia 

Most Russians celebrate New Year's Eve with their 
families and close friends. The origin of this holiday in Russiaderives 
from Christmas. Christmas was also a major holiday in Russia until it was banned, with all 
other religious holidays, by the Communist Party. To compensate for the absence 
of Christmas, New Year's was celebrated as much as Christmas was, but without 
the religious aspect of the holiday. Even after the fall of the Soviet Union, 
New Year's is celebrated in Russia and has become a Russian 
tradition. There is an old superstition that if the first visitor (especially an 
unexpected one) on January 1 is a man, the year will be good. People also try to 
start the new year without debts. 

Celebration usually starts one or two hours before 
midnight. A common tradition is to "say farewell to the old year" by remembering 
the most important events of the last twelve months. At five minutes to twelve 
most people watch the president's speech on TV[46] or watch popular New Year TV 
shows. There is a tradition to listen to the Kremlin clock bell ringing twelve 
times on the radio or on TV. During these last twelve seconds of the year people 
keep silence and make their secret wishes for the next year. After the clock 
strikes, they drink champagne and have rich dinner, watching TV concerts and 
having fun. Some people light fireworks outside and visit their friends and 
neighbors. As December 30 and 31 are working days, a lot of people also have 
small parties at work, though December 31 is mostly spent at home or with 
friends.

Serbia 

New Year's Eve in Serbiais traditionally celebrated extensively. Indoors, families celebrate New Year's Eve 
with an abundance of food. 'Serbs decorate trees, 'Novogodišnja jelka, at New 
Year's, rather than at Christmas. Near, or after midnight, Santa Claus (Deda 
Mraz) visits houses and leaves presents under the tree, to be unpacked then or, 
if the family is asleep, to be discovered in the morning. 

Restaurants, clubs, cafes and hotels are usually fully 
booked and organize New Year's celebrations with food and live 
music. 

Serbian New Year's celebrations are most known for the 
outdoors festivities in Belgrade, and several 
other major cities such as NoviSad and Niš. As of mid-December, cities are extensively 
decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the 
influence of the Julian calendar. Throughout the region, especially amongst 
former Yugoslav republics, Belgrade is the most popular destination for 
  major parties. It has become common for large groups of Slovenes to visit their 
  former capital and celebrate the beginning of a new year. Street celebrations 
  grow into mass gatherings with hundreds of thousands of people celebrating New 
  Year's in one of several locations throughout Belgrade. During former President Milošević's 
  term, the gatherings had a strong political connotation as well. Since 2000, 
  the City of Belgrade has annually organized several concerts with major national and international performers on Belgrade's major squares: 
  the Republic Square, Terazije Square and in front of the Serbian Parliament 
  building. The concerts commence early in the evening and last well into the 
morning. Usually, there are separate celebrations and concerts organized for 
small children ( in Slavija Square) and for elderly (in Kalemegdan park). 
Midnight is marked by major fireworks fired from buildings within the 
city. 

On January 1, the central Svetogorska streetis 
closed to vehicle traffic and is used to hold the "street of open heart" 
festival. Food and warm drinks are served and open air theater plays are 
performed, while families with children as well as politicians (often including 
the President) walk down the street. The evening of the first of January is 
reserved for the repriza, a repeat of the previous night; people often go to 
clubs, friends houses, or squares where they were the previous night, to 
celebrate once more. Slightly down-scaled festivities are 
organized. 

On January 13, 
a large part of the population[citation needed] celebrates "Serbian New Year", according to the Julian calendar. Usually one concert is 
organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament in Belgrade, while fireworks 
are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the Cathedral of 
Saint Sava, where people also gather. Other cities also organize such 
celebrations. 

Spain 

Spanish New Year's Eve (Nochevieja or Fin de Año) 
celebrations usually begin with a family dinner, traditionally including shrimp 
or prawns, and lamb or capon. Spanish tradition says that wearing new, red 
underwear on New Year's Eve brings good luck. The actual countdown is primarily 
followed from the clock on top of the Casa de Correos building in Puerta  del Sol 
Square in Madrid. It is traditional to eat twelve grapes, one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909, 
  when grape growers in Alicantethought of it as a way to cut down on 
the large production surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is 
followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous 
with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet 
each other and toast with sparkling wine such as cava or champagne, or with 
cider. 

After the family dinner and the grapes, many young people 
attend cotillones de nochevieja parties (named for the Spanish word cotillón, 
which refers to party supplies like confetti, party blowers, and party hats) at 
pubs, clubs, and similar places. Parties usually last until the next morning and 
range from small, personal celebrations at local bars to huge parties with 
guests numbering the thousands at hotel convention rooms. Early the next 
morning, party attendees usually gather to have the traditional winter breakfast 
of hot chocolate and fried pastry (chocolate con 
churros).

with Christmas and Bayrams are part of secular New Year's Eve celebrations in

  organized with family and friends, featuring a special Zante 
  currant-pimento-dill iç pilav dish, dolma, hot börek, baklava, and various 
  other eggplant dishes, topped with warm pide, salep, and boza. Even though 
  Turkish people generally don't celebrate Christmas, decorating Christmas trees 
  is a very popular tradition on New Year's Eve in Turkey. In 
Turkey, Santa Claus is associated with New Year's Eve instead of Christmas. 

Television and radio channels are known to continuously 
broadcast a variety of special New Year's Eve programs, while municipalities all 
around the country organize fundraising events for the poor, in addition to

shadow-theater, and even performances by the Mehter—the Janissary Band that was 
founded during the days of the Ottoman Empire. 

Public and private parties with large public attendances 
are organised in a number of cities and towns, particularly in the largest 
metropolitan areas such as Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Adana and Antalya, with the 
biggest celebrations taking place in Istanbul's Taksim, Beyoğlu, Nişantaşı and 
Kadıköy districts and Ankara's Kızılay Square, which generally feature dancing, 
concerts, laser and lightshows as well as the traditional countdown and 
fireworks display. 

Ukraine 

In the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet 
Union, New Year's has the same cultural significance as Christmas has in the 
United States, but without the religious connotations. Ukrainian families traditionally install spruce trees at home, the equivalent of 
a Christmas tree. Families gather to eat a large feast and reflect on the past 
year. They have a large celebration, make toasts, and make wishes for a happy 
New Year. Families give presents to their friends as well as informal 
acquaintances. As Ukrainians are traditionally a closely knit community, it is 
seen as a taboo to not give presents to those the family associates with. 
Children stay up until midnight, waiting for the New Year. During these 
celebrations many Ukrainians tune to special New Year shows, which have become a 
long-standing tradition for the Ukrainian TV. 

New Year is often considered a "pre-celebration" for 
Greek Catholics and Eastern Orthodox living in Eastern Europe, primarily in 
Ukraine, since Christmas is 
  celebrated on January 7.

Wales. The race celebrates the life and achievements of Welsh runner 
Guto Nyth Brân. Founded in 1958 by local runner Bernard Baldwin, it is run over 
the 5kilometreroute of Guto's first competitive race. The main 
race starts with a church service at Llanwynno, and then a wreath is laid on 
Guto's grave in Llanwynno graveyard. After lighting a torch, it is carried to 
the nearby town of Mountain Ash, where the main race takes place. 

The race consists of a double circuit of the town centre, starting in Henry 
Street and ending in Oxford Street, by the commemorative statue of Guto. Traditionally, the race was timed to end at 
  midnight, but in recent times it was rescheduled for the convenience of family 
  entertainment, now concluding at around 9pm. This has resulted in a growth in 
  size and scale, and the proceedings now start with an afternoon of street 
  entertainment, and fun run races for children, concluding with the church 
  service, elite runners' race and presentations.

Get your snorts, grunts and giggles on, let’s talk food and sex. 

Biologically speaking, to be successful you have to get three things done, no matter your species affiliation. You have to eat, stay alive and reproduce. Eating is for you and reproducing is giving it up for the team. The enjoyment aspect is the positive reinforcement to ensure you get the job done, for the survival of the individual and the species. Food and sex are two of life’s greatest pleasures. 

Both activities have similar effect on the senses, there is an instant visceral gratification of feeling good, of being completely lost in an ethereal moment of bliss. 

The lexicon used to describe food and sex is very similar and served up with plenty of double entendre. Advertisers know this and they are not shy about using the connection. 

What is your food of rapture? 

A fresh garden salad with a fruity vinaigrette is not going to do it. Think of glistening fat dripping off your face, a sizzle in the drizzle. Ripping meat off with your grease laden hands.  A mixture of textures in your mouth, that’ll make you burp and belch just to round off the grunts, a cacophony of sounds to enhance the dining experience. 

For me, the food of rapture is roast pork knuckle, a mixture of crisp crackling with fatty gelatinous goo, with each mouthful edging closer to a heart attack but who cares! Finish off with a shot of Schnapps to cap off the greasedorphins. 

Tell us, what is your food of rapture? 
\- How did you meet? 
\- Your first encounter 
\- Was it a fling or a lasting relationship?
