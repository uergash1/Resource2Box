"One legendary weekend". 
Last Vegas a Comedy which is directed by Jon Turteltaub and starring Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Kline. 
Last Vegas follows Billy (Michael Douglas), Paddy (Robert De Niro), Archie (Morgan Freeman) and Sam (Kevin Kline) have been best friends since childhood. So when Billy, the group's sworn bachelor, finally proposes to his thirty-something (of course) girlfriend, the four head to Las Vegas with a plan to stop acting their age and relive their glory days. However, upon arriving, the four quickly realize that the decades have transformed Sin City and tested their friendship in ways they never imagined. The Rat Pack may have once played the Sands and Cirque du Soleil may now rule the Strip, but it's these four who are taking over Vegas, 
in this sweet funny comedy that proves you are never too old to party or live life to the full if this does not warm your heart nothing will. 
Last Vegas this is a fun filled heart warming entertaining laugh out loud flick that proves time flies fast but been old don't mean you can't party and that to me is the message this film sends and I for one think it is a nice sweet message that everyone can relate to no matter their age, 
comedy jokes "There once was a woman who was quite begat. She had three babies named Nat, Pat, and Tat. 
She said it was fun in the breeding, but found it was hell in the feeding when she saw there was no tit for Tat" all laugh as they are the funny films in Hollywood some work well others do not and when I watch a comedy I want to laugh as I did with films like We're the Millers, Ted, Superbad, Airplane, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Team America: World Police, Borat, 
Shaun of the Dead, The Naked Gun, Planes, Trains and Automobiles, There's Something About Mary, 
I could keep going but I think you get the idea which films make me laugh and I will say that I do like a good comedy film slapstick or not as I do like a good laugh and now I watched this expecting a little and getting a lot as I got a roller-coaster of emotions and this packed in the laughs and I was left with a tear in my eye and a smile on my face. 
Last Vegas first of all I just want to admit and say yes that this is very much like the very funny at first original Hangover film series (just to inform you The Hangover is a series of three American road comedy films written and directed by Todd Phillips, and starring Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, and Ken Jeong, despite mixed reviews from film critics, the series has grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide, 
the films in the series are as follows: 
The Hangover (2009) - Three buddies wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas, with no memory of the previous night and the bachelor missing. They make their way around the city in order to find their friend before his wedding. 
The Hangover Part II (2011) - Two years after the bachelor party in Las Vegas, Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug jet to Thailand for Stu's wedding. Stu's plan for a subdued pre-wedding brunch, however, goes seriously awry. 
The Hangover Part III (2013) - When one of their own is kidnapped by an angry gangster, the Wolf Pack must track down Mr. Chow, who has escaped from prison and is on the lam.) 
which to me is no problem as I really enjoyed those films and as I was watching this I could not help but think this could be a fourth Hangover film where the wolf pack got back together in 30 years time which I think would make a even better end to the series but here its very funny fun stuff especially if you like The Hangover films. 
Last Vegas right I think the time has come to break this down and I will start with the opening meeting the characters scenes where we have a nice touch which is seeing the friends as kids before seeing how they are 58 years later and it is safe to say they are a lot older and living there own life's and after meeting them all the story begins  and this opening really sets the tone for this fun filled caper that's packed with laughs big and small. 
Last Vegas next up the middle is full of OAPs on the loose in a sunny gambling filled Las Vegas and it is a delight to see yes it is wired as I do not think people this old would go partying in Las Vegas but hey I did feel sorry for them when some of the younger generation were picking on them however I think they gave the younger people a run for there money and the club scene is one of the funny highlights, 
this middle is where the laughs are and we see the friends slowly bond after time apart from people but you also see a predictable end coming a mile away but who cares, 
I must also say here is where we really see Las Vegas (I think here is a nice time to inform you that Las Vegas is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Nevada and the county seat of Clark County, Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major resort city known primarily for gambling, shopping, fine dining, and nightlife and is the leading financial and cultural center for Southern Nevada. The city bills itself as The Entertainment Capital of the World, and is famous for its consolidated casino–hotels and associated entertainment.) and there are some great sights to behold such as the ride that Diana takes Billy blew me away it looked exciting but very scary god I am not good with heights and it gave me chills just watching them on the ride, but I will say Las Vegas is a place where I would like to visit but as this film shows your never too old so I think I will get it done in my life time. 
Last Vegas right moving on now I must say the climax is predictable and is filled with sadness as we see a final party with lots of music and friends recalling old times and a secrete coming to light about who a girl choose when the friends were younger there is less comedy however it is still all fun and enjoyable to behold but the last sex induced scene ends this on a high and I really sat back and thought wow I want to watch again. 
Last Vegas this is a real sweet swift gripping comedy with a short and sweet run time of just 105 minuets and to be honest I could have watched for much longer then that hell I would love a trilogy of these guys on holiday like a alternative Inbetweeners flick as this had me laughing all the way through and I will be watching again again and again and again I really enjoyed this and you will too. 
Last Vegas overall acting wise what more can I say apart from to sum up all the acting legends do a fantastic job and I felt there friendship I felt these guys had really been friends from been young yes character development was lacking but who cares and there are a few performances I will mention firstly 
Michael Douglas known for Fatal Attraction, Falling Down, You, Me and Dupree, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, Behind the Candelabra to me everything I see him in just seems soo easy to him there is a reason why he is still going strong in Hollywood after all these years and it is in his performances and here is no different his character just suits him yes it is nothing powerful he is having fun and here his enjoyment oozed off screen and made me believe his character even though it was not fleshed out as good as it could have been I mean what did his character actually do but he still makes his character come alive so well done to him, 
next up the brilliant Morgan Freeman known for Se7en, The Shawshank Redemption, Deep Impact, Bruce Almighty, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Olympus Has Fallen, Invictus I really think he is a great actor again everything just seems to come easy to him and he really fits his character here but more than anything here he owns as Freemam dancing is just genius I loved it you have to see him dance what more can I say, 
lastly I just want to say that Robert De Niro, Kevin Kline, Romany Malco, Mary Steenburgen and many more do a really good job too and just makes this a really enjoyable trip with some good acting on display from some true legends in Hollywood. 
Last Vegas for me all I want to say is yes this is not perfect but I just don't see what's not to like here its all about knowing time flies first your young then your old it happens to us all it is a fact of life yes it is a sad fact and you may get tears when you watch this but you just got to live while your alive go for your dreams live each day to the full and I like the message this film sends and it makes this one of the best films I have seen for a while and it is one to watched again and again, 
also is it too much to ask for a sequel because it would be nice to get one. 
Last Vegas in short this is more than just a geriatric cash-in on The Hangover and I have to say this is a likeable crowd-pleaser that is surprisingly very funny and enjoyable from start to finish, the setting of Las Vegas is beautiful the comedy is on top form the acting is what you would expect from some legends of the business all in all this is a very funny heart warming delight and a must see, 
for me this is a perfect sit back relax cry laugh feature that is a really enjoyable film well worth watching and it will fill you will sadness happiness and a thought of I hope I am like these guys when I am older, 
"These Red Bull/vodkas are strange. I feel like I'm getting drunk and electrocuted at the same time!". 
7.5/10﻿
