Looking for some new suggestions... I am currently reading the Sookie Stackhouse Novels aka what  +True Blood is based off of series (since someone finally talked me into watching the show).  They are cute, fun, novels and I try and mix my reading up from industry publications, business books and autobiographies sometimes. 

So after this series.... what should I read next? :)

This is a completely not comprehensive list of recommendations. 

Fantasy 
‘Tigana’ (and others) by Guy Gavriel Kay (#1 fantasy fic book of all time, and my #1 of all.) 
‘Lord of the Rings’ &amp; ‘The Silmarillion’ by JRR Tolkien 
‘The Belgariad’ (series) by David Eddings 
‘The Riftwar Saga’ (series) by Raymond E Feist 
‘The Dragon Riders of Pern’ (series) by Anne McCaffrey (read them in the order she released them for best effect.) 

SciFi (these tend to be much more… significant… than the fantasy lit.) 
‘Dune’ by Frank Herbert (just the first does it, but you can read the series if you want. This is a yearly read for me.) 
‘Fahrenheit 451’ by Ray Bradbury (can never read this one enough.) 
‘Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?’ (and others) by Phillip K. Dick 
‘Neuromancer’ by William Gibson 
‘Snow Crash’ by Neal Stephenson (absolute necessary read.) 
‘The Dispossessed’ by Ursula K. LeGuin 
‘Childhood’s End’, ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ (and many others) by Arthur C. Clarke 
‘The Foundation’ (series) by Isaac Asimov 
Pulp (light, but really good reading) 
‘The Barsoom’ (series) by Edgar Rice Burroughs (John Carter, origins of Star Wars stuff.) 
‘Temeraire’ (series) by Naomi Novik (naval fiction + dragons = awesome) 
‘The Brethren’ by Henry Rider Haggard 

Classic Fic 
‘Winesburg, Ohio’ by Sherwood Anderson 
‘East of Eden’ (and others) by John Steinbeck 
‘The Mayor of Casterbridge’ by Thomas Hardy 
‘Silas Mariner’ and ‘Adam Bede’ by George Eliot 
‘The Heart of Darkness’ by Joseph Conrad 
‘The Dubliners’ and (if you are brave) ‘Ulysses’ by James Joyce 
‘The Jungle Book’ and ‘Kim’ by Rudyard Kipling 
‘The Portrait of Dorian Gray’ by Oscar Wilde (best villain in all of literature) 
‘The Sun Also Rises’ by Ernest Hemingway 
'The Great Gatsby' by F. Scott Fitzgerald 
…this list could go on and on… 

Non Fic 
‘The Starfish and the Spider’ by Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom 
‘Blink’ and ‘Outliers’ by Malcolm Gladwell 
‘The Pentagon’s New Map’ by Thomas P.M. Barnett 
‘The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich’ by William L. Shirer 

Order of importance: 
‘Tigana’, ‘Dune’, ‘Blink’, ‘Snow Crash’, ‘The Dispossessed’, ‘Neuromancer’

We had a great discussion of what books everyone MUST have on their bookshelves at all times. 

I spent last night looking at my giant to read pile trying to figure out which book would be next. I go in waves. Sometimes I have several books going, sometimes just one. Right now....None. I just can't make up mind. 

The question today is: What book(s) are you currently reading? Are you a one book at a time person or do you have several going...
