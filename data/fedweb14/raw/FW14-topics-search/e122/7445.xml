I did 30 minutes of stations after work with some friends and then I set off on a 3 mile jog. The stations help to tone my muscles that I am not 100% happy with yet (arms, thighs, abs...well mostly everything). I locked up my classroom and literally ran straight out my back door. I love my Nike running app or I swear I would always be sticking to a treadmill. I turned my app on and did not start heading back until I was almost done running 3 miles. The run took me about 35 minutes (I did have to stop and talk to my mother on the phone for a minute or 2) but overall, I think that is pretty okay. I am not a sprinter, I am just focused on distance and not stopping because my body feels like I can't go any farther. 
     As far as my diet goes....well I didn't have one today. This week is full of yummy holiday goodies at lunch for the teachers.  One of my silly reasons for loosing weight was because I actually love food so much, I wanted to be able to eat without stressing out about how fat I was or how much MORE weight that brownie was going to make me gain. Needless to say, I am so excited about the holidays and not stressing over my weight. I am not planning on hard core watching what I eat until after the holidays. However, I am making sure that I get the proper amount of water, vitamins, protein, and carbs that I will need for training. It is going to be so strange (but yet fun) changing from the low carb diet that I have been maintaining for almost a year now to a diet full of "good" carbs. I am pretty happy that I have a reason to eat pasta and mashed potatoes again!!﻿

My goal is to run the 26miles/42km marathon in under 4 1/2 hours.  I've only done one other marathon in my life in 1998 and my time was 4 hrs 50 minutes. I considered it a failure cause I walked the last 10km.  Here's a video of a recent training run:  Marathon Training &amp; My Day Job﻿
