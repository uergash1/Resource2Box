I, probably much like you (unless you have never seen a tape in which case go play your ipod and debate about #io6 on another post... :) ), Have been putting this off forever. I had a box stuffed deep in the basement, that was full of tapes I loved as a child. There is also several of me singing and few mix tapes I wouldn't mind remembering. But make them into mp3s? "Someday"... Today was that day.. and You should to. It wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be. 

*5 Steps To Getting Your Cassettes Into Mp3s* 

Step 1 - Download Audacity - http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ Pc mac linux all available.. and its free 

Step 2 - Find a tape device. Although not the best quality I used a stereo cable from the headphone to the line in on my computer. After a few tweaks with my setting the "line in appeared" in Audacity and we were good to go. 

Step 3 - Make a test recording for 30 seconds or so. Hit play on tape. Hit Record on Software. Yup worked? Good. 

Step 4 - Record a full side and then export. It will export as a wav file. 

Step 5 - Open up Itunes, Load the wav file in and then convert it to MP3. 

All done.  Took longer for me to write this post out and I'm glad its off the checklist of "to do someday that will never come".

Do you know the system Android? 

Android (operating system) 

Android is an operating system for mobile devices suchas smartphonesand tablet computers. It is developed by the Open Handset Alliance led by Google.[7][8]Google purchased theinitial developer of the software, Android Inc., in 2005.[9]The unveiling of the Android distribution on November 5, 2007 was announcedwith the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of 84 hardware,software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancingopenstandards for mobile devices.[10][11][12][13]Google released most of the Android code under the ApacheLicense, a free software license.[14]The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is tasked with the maintenance andfurther development of Android.[15]Android consists of a kernel based on the Linux kernel,with middleware,librariesand APIs written in C and application software running on an application framework which includesJava-compatible libraries based on ApacheHarmony. Android uses the Dalvik virtual machine with just-in-time compilation to run Dalvikbytecode, which is usually translated from Java bytecode.[16]Android has a large community of developers writing applications("apps") that extend the functionality of the devices. Developerswrite primarily in a customized version of Java.[17]There are currently approximately 300,000 apps available for Android, from atotal of 500,000 apps over the life of Android.[18][19][20]Apps can be downloaded from third-party sites or through online stores such as AndroidMarket, the app store run by Google.Android was listed as thebest-selling smartphone platform worldwide in Q4 2010 by Canalys[21][22]with over 190 million Android devices in use by October 2011.[23]FoundationAndroid, Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California, United States inOctober, 2003 by Andy Rubin (co-founder of Danger),[24]Rich Miner(co-founder of Wildfire Communications, Inc.),[25]Nick Sears (once VP at T-Mobile),[26]and Chris White (headed design and interface development at WebTV)[27]to develop, in Rubin's words "...smarter mobile devices that are moreaware of its owner's location and preferences".[28]Despite the obvious past accomplishments of the founders and early employees,Android Inc. operated secretly, revealing only that it was working on softwarefor mobile phones.[28]That same year, Rubin ran out of money. StevePerlman brought him $10,000 in cash in an envelope and refused a stake inthe company.[29]Acquisition by GoogleGoogleacquired Android Inc. in August 2005, making Android Inc. a wholly ownedsubsidiary of Google Inc. Key employees of Android Inc., including Andy Rubin,Rich Miner and Chris White, stayed at the company after the acquisition.[9]Not much was known about Android Inc. at the time of the acquisition, but manyassumed that Google was planning to enter the mobilephone market with this move.[9]Post-acquisition developmentAt Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform poweredby the Linuxkernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the premise of providing aflexible, upgradable system. Google had lined up a series of hardware componentand software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to variousdegrees of cooperation on their part.[30][31][32]Speculation about Google's intention to enter the mobile communicationsmarket continued to build through December 2006.[33]Reports from the BBCand The Wall Street Journal noted thatGoogle wanted its search and applications on mobile phones and it was workinghard to deliver that. Print and online media outlets soon reported rumors thatGoogle was developing a Google-branded handset.[34]Some speculated that as Google was defining technical specifications, it wasshowing prototypes to cell phone manufacturers and network operators.In September 2007, InformationWeek covered an Evalueservestudy reporting that Google had filed several patent applicationsin the area of mobile telephony.[35][36]Open Handset AllianceMain article: Open Handset AllianceOn November 5, 2007, the Open Handset Alliance, a consortiumof several companies which include Broadcom Corporation, Google, HTC, Intel,LG,Marvell Technology Group, Motorola,Nvidia,Qualcomm,Samsung Electronics, SprintNextel, T-Mobile and TexasInstruments unveiled itself. The goal of the Open Handset Allianceis to develop open standards for mobiledevices.[12]On the same day, the Open Handset Alliance also unveiled their first product,Android, a mobile device platform built on the Linuxkernel version 2.6.[12]On December 9, 2008, 14 new members joined, including ARMHoldings, Atheros Communications, AsustekComputer Inc, Garmin Ltd, Huawei Technologies, PacketVideo,Softbank,SonyEricsson, Toshiba Corp, and VodafoneGroup Plc.[37][38]LicensingWith the exception of brief update periods, Android has been available underfree and open source softwarelicenses from October 21, 2008 until March 2011.[39]Google published the source code for their Linux kernel changes under the GNU General Public License version 2,and the rest of the code (including network and telephony stacks)[40]under the Apache License version 2.0.[41][42][43]Google also keeps the reviewed issues list publicly open for anyone to see andcomment.[44]The Open Handset Alliance develops the GPL-licensed part of Android, that istheir changes to the Linux kernel, in public, with source code publiclyavailable at all times. The rest of Android is developed in private, withsource code released publicly when a major new version is released. TypicallyGoogle collaborates with a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship devicefeaturing the new version of Android, then makes the source code availableafter that device has been released.[45]In early 2011, Google chose to withhold the Android source code to thetablet-only Honeycomb release, creating doubts over Google's commitment to opensource with Android.[39]The reason, according to Andy Rubin in an official Android blog post, was becauseHoneycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom,[46]and they did not want third parties creating a "really bad userexperience" by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of Androidintended for tablets.[47]Google later confirmed that the Honeycomb source code would not be releaseduntil after it was merged with the Gingerbread release in Ice Cream Sandwich.[48]Even though the software is open source, device manufacturers cannot useGoogle's Android trademark unless Google certifies that the device complieswith their Compatibility Definition Document (CDD). Devices must also meet thisdefinition to be eligible to license Google's closed-source applications,including the Android Market.[49]In September 2010, Skyhook Wireless filed a lawsuit against Google inwhich they alleged that Google had used the compatibility document to blockSkyhook's mobile positioning service (XPS) from Motorola's Android mobiledevices.[50]In December 2010 a judge denied Skyhook's motion for preliminary injunction,saying that Google had not closed off the possibility of accepting a revisedversion of Skyhook's XPS service, and that Motorola had terminated theircontract with Skyhook because Skyhook wanted to disable Google's location datacollection functions on Motorola's devices, which would have violatedMotorola's obligations to Google and its carriers.[51]Version historyMain article: Android version historyAndroid has seen a number of updates since its original release, each fixingbugsand adding new features. Each version is named, in alphabetical order, after adessert.[52]Recent releases2.3 Gingerbread refined the user interface, improved the soft keyboard and copy/paste features, improved gaming performance, added SIP support (VoIP calls), and added support for Near Field Communication. Android 2.3 Gingerbread is the latest Android version that is available to phones.[53]3.0 Honeycomb was a tablet-oriented[54][55][56] release which supports larger screen devices and introduces many new user interface features, and supports multi-core processors and hardware acceleration for graphics.[57] The first device featuring this version, the Motorola Xoom tablet, went on sale in February 2011.[58][59]· 3.1 Honeycomb,released in May 2011, added support for extra input devices, USB host mode fortransferring information directly from cameras and other devices, and theGoogle Movies and Books apps.[60]· 3.2 Honeycomb,released in July 2011, added optimization for a broader range of screen sizes,new "zoom-to-fill" screen compatibility mode, loading media filesdirectly from SD card, and an extended screen support API.[61]Huawei MediaPadis the first 7 inch tablet to use this version [62]4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, announced on October 19, 2011, brought Honeycomb features to smartphones and added new features including facial recognition unlock, network data usage monitoring and control, unified social networking contacts, photography enhancements, offline email searching, and information sharing using NFC.[63]LinuxAndroid's kernel is a fork of the Linuxkernel and has further architecture changes by Google outside the typicalLinux kernel development cycle.[64]Android does not have a native XWindow System nor does it support the full set of standard GNU libraries, and thismakes it difficult to port existing Linux applications or libraries to Android.[65]Certain features Google contributed back to the kernel, notably a powermanagement feature called wakelocks, were rejected by mainline kerneldevelopers, partly because kernel maintainers felt that Google did not show anyintent to maintain their own code.[66][67][68]Even though Google announced in April 2010 that they would hire two employeesto work with the Linux kernel community,[69]Greg Kroah-Hartman, the current Linux kernelmaintainer for the -stable branch, said in December 2010 that he was concernedthat Google was no longer trying to get their code changes included inmainstream Linux.[67]Some Google Android developers hinted that "the Android team was gettingfed up with the process", because they were a small team and had more urgentwork to do on Android.[70]However, in September 2010 Linux kernel developer Rafael J. Wysocki added apatch that improved the mainline Linux wakeup events framework. He said thatAndroid device drivers that use wakelocks can now be easily merged intomainline Linux, but that Android's opportunistic suspend features should not beincluded in the mainline kernel.[71][72]In 2011 Linus Torvalds said that "eventually Androidand Linux would come back to a common kernel, but it will probably not be forfour to five years."[73]FeaturesArchitecture diagramCurrent features and specifications:[74][75][76]Handset layoutsThe platform is adaptable tolarger, VGA, 2D graphics library, 3D graphics library based on OpenGL ES2.0 specifications, and traditional smartphone layouts.StorageSQLite, alightweight relational database, is used for data storagepurposes.ConnectivityAndroid supports connectivitytechnologies including GSM/EDGE, IDEN, CDMA, EV-DO, UMTS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC and WiMAX.MessagingSMS and MMS are available forms of messaging,including threaded text messaging and now Android Cloud To DeviceMessaging Framework (C2DM) is also a part of Android PushMessaging service.Multiple language supportAndroid supports multiple human languages. Thenumber of languages more than doubled for the platform 2.3 Gingerbread.[citationneeded]Web browserThe web browser available inAndroid is based on the open-source WebKit layoutengine, coupled with Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. The browser scores a95/100 on the Acid3Test.Java supportWhile most Android applicationsare written in Java, there is no Java Virtual Machine in the platform and Javabyte code is not executed. Java classes are compiled into Dalvik executablesand run on Dalvik, a specialized virtual machine designedspecifically for Android and optimized for battery-powered mobile devices withlimited memory and CPU. J2MEsupport can be provided via third-party applications.Media supportAndroid supports the followingaudio/video/still media formats: WebM, H.263,H.264 (in 3GP or MP4 container), MPEG-4SP, AMR, AMR-WB (in 3GPcontainer), AAC, HE-AAC (in MP4 or3GP container), MP3, MIDI, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, WAV, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP.[76]Streaming media supportRTP/RTSP streaming (3GPP PSS, ISMA), HTML progressive download(HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag). Adobe Flash Streaming (RTMP) and HTTP DynamicStreaming are supported by the Flash plugin.[77]Apple HTTP Live Streaming is supported by RealPlayer for Mobile,[78]and by the operating system in Android 3.0 (Honeycomb).[57]Additional hardware supportAndroid can use video/stillcameras, touchscreens,GPS, accelerometers,gyroscopes,barometers,magnetometers,dedicated gaming controls, proximityand pressure sensors, thermometers,accelerated 2D bitblits (with hardware orientation, scaling, pixel format conversion) andaccelerated 3D graphics.Multi-touchAndroid has native support for multi-touchwhich was initially made available in handsets such as the HTC Hero. Thefeature was originally disabled at the kernel level (possibly to avoidinfringing Apple's patents on touch-screen technology at the time).[79]Google has since released an update for the Nexus Oneand the Motorola Droid which enables multi-touch natively.[80]BluetoothSupports A2DP, AVRCP, sending files(OPP), accessing the phone book (PBAP), voice dialing and sending contacts betweenphones. Keyboard, mouse and joystick (HID) support is available in Android 3.1+, and inearlier versions through manufacturer customizations and third-partyapplications.[81]Video callingAndroid does not support nativevideo calling, but some handsets have a customized version of the operatingsystem that supports it, either via the UMTS network (like the SamsungGalaxy S) or over IP. Video calling through Google Talk is available inAndroid 2.3.4 and later. Gingerbread allows Nexus S toplace Internet calls with a SIP account. This allows for enhanced VoIP dialingto other SIP accounts and even phone numbers. Skype 2.1 offers video calling inAndroid 2.3, including front camera support.MultitaskingMultitasking of applications isavailable.[82]Voice based featuresGoogle search through voice hasbeen available since initial release.[83]Voice actions for calling, texting, navigation, etc. are supported on Android2.2 onwards.[84]TetheringAndroid supports tethering,which allows a phone to be used as a wireless/wired Wi-Fihotspot. Before Android 2.2 this was supported by third-party applicationsor manufacturer customizations.[85]Screen captureAndroid has native support for screenshotcapture ability by pressing the power and volume buttons at the same time on anAndroid device. This native support came about with the release of Android's 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) update which isfirst seen on the Galaxy Nexus smartphone.[86]Previously Android did not feature native support for screen capturing whichwould have likely been due to security concerns. Furthermore previously, manufacturerand third-party customizations as well as using a PC connection (DDMSdeveloper's tool) were the only known methods of capturing a screenshot onAndroid.[87]UsesMain article: List of Android devicesNexus S, the current "Google phone"The Android operating system is used on smartphones,laptops,netbooks,tabletcomputers, Google TV, wristwatches[88],headphones[89]and other devices.[90][91][92]The main hardware platform for Android is the ARMarchitecture. There is support for x86 from theAndroid-x86 project,[93]and Google TV uses a special x86 version of Android.The first commercially available phone to run Android was the HTCDream, released on 22 October 2008.[94]In early 2010 Google collaborated with HTC tolaunch its flagship[95]Android device, the Nexus One. This was followedlater in 2010 with the Samsung-made NexusS and in 2011 with the GalaxyNexus.iOSand Android 2.3.3 'Gingerbread' may be set up to dual boot on a jailbrokeniPhone or iPod Touch with the help of OpeniBoot and iDroid.[96][97]ApplicationsSee also: Android software development and List of open source AndroidapplicationsApplications are usually developed in the Java language using the AndroidSoftware Development Kit, but other development tools are available,including a Native Development Kit forapplications or extensions in C or C++, Google App Inventor, a visualenvironment for novice programmers and various cross platform mobileweb applications frameworks .Android MarketMain article: AndroidMarketAndroid Market is the online software store developed by Google for Androiddevices. An application program ("app") called "Market" ispreinstalled on most Android devices and allows users to browse and downloadapps published by third-party developers, hosted on Android Market. As ofDecember 2010 there were about 200,000 games, applications and widgetsavailable on the Android Market.[98]In April 2011 Google said there had been more than 3 billion Android appsinstalled[99]and at end of June 2011 there are 6 billion apps installs from the Androidmarket. The operating system itself is installed on 130 million total devices.[100]Only devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements areallowed to preinstall Google's closed-source Android Market app and access theMarket.[101]The Market filters the list of applications presented by the Market app tothose that are compatible with the user's device, and developers may restricttheir applications to particular carriers or countries for business reasons. [102]Google has participated in the Android Market by offering severalapplications themselves, including GoogleVoice (for the Google Voice service), Sky Map (for watching stars),Finance (for their finance service), Maps Editor (for their MyMaps service),Places Directory (for their Local Search), GoogleGoggles that searches by image, Gesture Search (for usingfinger-written letters and numbers to search the contents of the phone), GoogleTranslate, Google Shopper, Listen for podcasts and My Tracks, a joggingapplication. In August 2010, Google launched "Voice Actions forAndroid",[103]which allows users to search, write messages, and initiate calls by voice.Alternatively, users can install apps from third party app stores such asthe Amazon Appstore,[104]or directly onto the device if they have the application's APK file.Application securityAn example of app permissions in Android Market.Android applications run in a sandbox, an isolated area ofthe operating system that does not have access to the rest of the system'sresources, unless access permissions are granted by the user when theapplication is installed. Before installing an application, Android Marketdisplays all required permissions. A game may need to enable vibration, forexample, but should not need to read messages or access the phonebook. Afterreviewing these permissions, the user can decide whether to install theapplication.[105]Some Android malwareincidents have been reported involving rogue applications on Android Market. Insome cases applications which contained trojanswere hidden in pirated versionsof legitimate apps.[106][107]Google has responded by removing malicious apps from the Android Market, andremotely disabling them on infected devices.[108]Security firms such as AVG Technologies and Symantechave released antivirus software for Android devices.PrivacyAndroid smartphones have the ability to report the location of Wi-Fi access points,encountered as phone users move around, to build vast databases containing thephysical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points. Thesedatabases form electronic maps to locate smartphones, allowing them to run appslike Foursquare, Latitude,Places,and to deliver location-based ads.[109]One design issue is that average users cannot monitor how applicationsaccess and use private and sensitive data (e.g. location and hardware IDnumbers). Even during installation, permission checks do not often indicate tothe user how critical services and data will be used or misused. Third partymonitoring software such as TaintDroid,[110]an academic research-funded project, can identify personal information sentfrom applications to remote servers.[111]MarketingThe Android logo was designed along with the Droidfont family made by Ascender Corporation.[112]Android Green is the color of the Android Robot that represents the Androidoperating system. The print color is PMS 376C and the RGBcolor value in hexadecimal is #A4C639, as specified by the Android BrandGuidelines.[113]The custom typeface of Android is called Norad (cf. NORAD). It is only used inthe text logo.[114]Market shareResearch company Canalys estimated in Q2 2009 that Android had a 2.8% share ofworldwide smartphoneshipments.[115]By Q4 2010 this had grown to 33% of the market, becoming the top-sellingsmartphone platform. This estimate includes the Tapas and OMS variants ofAndroid.[21]In February 2010 ComScore said the Android platform had 9.0% of the U.S.smartphone market, as measured by current mobile subscribers. This figure wasup from an earlier estimate of 5.2% in November 2009.[116]By the end of Q3 2010 Android's U.S. market share had grown to 21.4%.[117]In May 2010, Android's first quarter U.S. sales surpassed that of the rivaliPhone platform. According to a report by the NPD group, Android achieved 25%smartphone sales in the US market, up 8% from the December quarter. In thesecond quarter, Apple's iOS was up by 11%, indicating that Android is takingmarket share mainly from RIM, and still has to compete with heavyconsumer demand for new competitor offerings.[118]Furthermore, analysts pointed to advantages that Android has as amulti-channel, multi-carrier OS, which allowed it to duplicate the quick successof Microsoft's Windows Mobile.[119]In Q4 2010 Android had 59% of the total installed user base of Apple's iOSin the U.S. and 46% of the total installed user base of iOSin Europe.[120][121]As of June 2011 Google said that 550,000 new Android devices were beingactivated every day[122]—upfrom 400,000 per day a month earlier in May 2011, and more than 100 milliondevices have been activated.[19]Android hit 300,000 activations per day back in December 2010. On July 14, 2011550,000 Android devices are now activated by Google each day with growth 4.4%per week.[123]On the 1st of August 2011 Canalys estimates Android has about 48% of the smartphonemarket share.[124]On October 13, 2011, Google announced that there are 190 million Androiddevices in the market. [125]Intellectual property infringement claimsSee also: Oracle Corporation#Lawsuit against GoogleBoth Android and Android phone manufacturers have been the target ofnumerous patent lawsuits. On 12 August 2010, Oracle sued Google overclaimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the Java programming language.[127]Specifically, the patent infringement claim references seven United Statespatents including US5966702 "Method and apparatus for pre-processing and packagingclass files", and US6910205 "Interpreting functions utilizing a hybrid of virtualand native machine instructions".[128]In response, Google submitted multiple lines of defense, counterclaiming thatAndroid did not infringe on Oracle's patents or copyright, that Oracle'spatents were invalid, and several other defenses. They said that Android isbased on Apache Harmony, a cleanroom implementation of the Java class libraries, and anindependently developed virtual machine called Dalvik.[129][130][131]Microsofthas also sued several manufacturers of Android devices for patent infringement,and collects patent licensing fees from others. In October 2011 Microsoft saidthey had signed license agreements with ten Android device manufacturers,accounting for 55% of worldwide revenue for Android devices.[132]These include Samsungand HTC.[133]Google has publicly expressed its dislike for the current patent landscapein the United States, accusing Apple,Oracle and Microsoft of trying to take down Android through patent litigation,rather than innovating and competing with better products and services.[134]In August 2011, Google purchased MotorolaMobility for US$12.5billion, which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect Android,since Motorola Mobility had a 17,000-strong patent pool.[135]References1. ^Lextrait, Vincent (January 2010).
