Because of my move closer to Washington, DC I haven't had a chance to take any new pictures of Peaches. I had to go back a number of weeks to find this shot of her hard at work on a horse farm. 

I was there to shoot new pictures of the horses for the farm's new website and Peaches was working as my trusty first assistant all day. I know it looks like she's not working very hard in this image but she really did work hard that day... 

Happy National Dog Day, everyone!﻿

2700-2000 BC, Armenian Highlands. 
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. 

The invention of agriculture was a pivotal event in human history. The first animal tamed by people was the dog. Its domestication probably occurred in the Early Stone Age, in the period of hunting development. Centuries later, people managed to tame sheep, pigs, goats, and cows. The Armenian Highlands are crucial in this regard. The oldest center of stock farming can be traced to the Armenian plateau. In a paper: “Domestication and early agriculture in the Mediterranean Basin: Origins, diffusion, and impact” Dr. Melinda A. Zeder (2008) argues that the early spread of agriculture known as the Neolithic revolution spread from the Armenian plateau through a mix of colonization and cultural diffusion, into Europe and elsewhere. [1] Dr. Zeder believes that in Europe the indigenous hunter gatherers adopted the new farming technologies by cultural diffusion. 

On the slopes of volcanic massifs of Armenia, 3000 meters above sea level, one can find whole galleries of rock drawings of agricultural motives. Some of these petroglyphs are dated as far as the 12th -11th millennium BC. [2] The population of the Armenian plateau was among the first to domesticate animals. One of the most significant reforms in the history of mankind made comprehensive changes in the economic life of the society and exerted immediate influence on the formation of new mythology and systems of chronology. 

Baverley Davis (2007) in his chronology (Timeline of the Development of the Horse) describes: 

“Petroglyphs found in Armenia (one of the possible sites for the Indo-European homeland) show the oldest pictures of men driving chariots, wagons, and plows, with horses doing the pulling.” ﻿
