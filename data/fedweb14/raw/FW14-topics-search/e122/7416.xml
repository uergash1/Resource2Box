Take-Two has delayed BioShock Infinite until February 26, 2013. "When we announced the release date of BioShock Infinite in March, we felt pretty good about the timing. Since then, we've uncovered opportunities to make Infinite into something even more extraordinary," said Irrational Games Creative Director Ken Levine. "Therefore, to give our talented team the time they need to deliver the best Infinite possible, we've decided to move the game's release to February." Levine also mentioned in a separate statement that the game will be going dark from here on out, noting it will not be shown at mega events E3 and Gamescom. "That way, the next time you see our game, it will be essentially the product we intend to put in the box. for more on this follow the link........ http://www.rheena.com/showthread.php/153874

BioShock Infinite, originally scheduled to be released October 16, has been pushed back to February 26, 2013, Irrational Games said Wednesday. The developer also said that it would not show the anticipated shooter at the E3 or Gamescom trade shows this year. 

“It means a bit more waiting, but more importantly, it means an even better BioShock Infinite, said creative director Ken Levine in a statement. “The great can be made greater, and we owe it to both ourselves and to you, our fans, to take this opportunity,” he said. 

“[We] have an end date and we can know when it’s time to put pencils down,” he said then. “You can keep going forever, honestly. I could work on this game for another 20 years and keep polishing it and making it better. But at some point –- and this wasn’t decided by our publisher, this was my decision –- you need to say ‘this is the date.’ It helps keep the team focused on finishing it, knowing they have a constraint. I always think you work the hardest when you have constraints because that sort of helps you define your task.”﻿

For those who can't quite understand how it is to have your favorite game pushed back, its kinda like teachers telling you your kid has to stay back...THREE YEARS IN A ROW! Now it's finally the year when the game is due to come out and if it is pushed back one more time then i will have no choice but to make it myself.....out of some old cans, a used squirrel, and three double A batteries. Heres hoping for the correct release date! ﻿

   So I have seen that #biggestINFINTEfan  is trending. So I, naturally, think this has to do with the upcoming release of Bioshock Infinite (video game) on March 26th. 
"That is awesome" I say. Sweet that it is trending a week before the release date. 
So I check it out..... 

:face palm: 

Apparently it has something to do with a South Korean pop boy band. EISH.  I don't know if I am more disappointed or embarrassed. 
Here is a picture of the real INFINITE that should be trending.
