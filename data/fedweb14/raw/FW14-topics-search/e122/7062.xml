On this day, September 4, 1957 — 55 years ago — Democratic Governor of Arkansas, Orval Faubus, defied the Supreme Court of the United States, called up the state National Guard, and ordered the Guard to prohibit 9 African-American students from entering Central High School in Little Rock. In 1954, the Supreme Court had unanimously ruled in “Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka” that racial segregation in educational facilities is unconstitutional. 

For 17 days the Arkansas National Guard prevented the African-American students from attending the school, while it did nothing to disperse angry whites that gathered each day outside the school to jeer the African-American students for attempting to enter school. President Eisenhower’s Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, informed Eisenhower that this Little Rock situation was seriously eroding the reputation of the U.S. around the world. 

Finally, on September 24, President Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and ordered them to return to their armories. Eisenhower then sent 1,000 federal troops (elements of the U.S. Army’s “Screaming Eagles” — renowned for their liberating assault operations in World War II) to Arkansas to protect the African-American students and guarantee their admission to high school. On September 25, the African-American students entered the high school for the first time under heavily armed federal protection, and they finished out the school year. 

Governor Faubus reacted to Eisenhower’s federal intervention by closing Little Rock high schools for the following school year (1958-1959), which forced the African-American students to take correspondence classes or go to out-of-state schools. Faubus’s action also caused 3,665 students to be locked out of schools, while it locked in paying 200 teachers and administrators to serve empty classrooms. The next school year, 1959-1960, the schools were re-opened, despite ongoing violence including the bombing of one African-American student’s house, and 4 of the original 9 African-American students returned to school — this time protected by local police. 

The Little Rock Central High School is now a National Historic Site.
