I was listening to a podcast last night and found myself agreeing with both sides of this story. (With the usual disclaimer that it is never ok to rape, mug or harm anyone else in any way if not in imminent danger yourself.) Although I have no interest in the hash-tagged photos published by Glass wearers, I don't think of them as Glassholes. I do think they're nuts to spend so much money on something that should have been loaned to them free in exchange for the evaluation service they give to Google. I also agree with LL that Glass is probably just a way of testing a wearables SDK. I seriously wonder if this is meant to be an actual product. 

Back to the attacks. LL thinks it's crazy to walk around the Mission District of SF with Glass on your head. He made allusion to the recent mugging in Mexico of someone who held an iPhone presumably too visible. Professor JJ thinks you should be able to walk anywhere with Glass and feel safe and that it's a "tragedy" if we can't. The word is a little strong, but it's true we should, and the many arguments about this are already out there en masse. What is Glass if not the tech equivalent of a Rolex worn on your face? 
It occurs to me that the following analogy makes some sense. 
In California, drivers are legally bound to stop for pedestrians in a crosswalk. You walk out without looking between two parked cars and a driver hits you. He was speeding and couldn't possibly have stopped in time. The driver is wrong, morally and legally (broke two laws), but you didn't make sure it wasn't dangerous to cross by simply looking down the street. 
While in every sense you, the injured pedestrian are in the right, it doesn't mitigate the injury in any way. It may not be the law to look both ways before crossing, but it is both common sense and has been advised since you were a child, unless you grew up somewhere that had no streets. The wiser course would be to make sure it's safe to cross, rather depending upon civilized and legal behavior of unknown persons. 

Getting back to the use of the word tragedy, it isn't the relative safety of Glass Explorers that's tragic, it's the general state of our society. We're told that we are safer now than ever in history, which I believe is true. But I also believe that we're a lot safer if we think about the context and not tempt fate. You should be able to walk down a deserted alley at night, or wear wear ostentatious jewelry in the subway, but it is common knowledge that in big South American cities, cameras are a huge thieves' target as LL found out when he was down there. You have to be vigilant and make wise decisions. 

We humans came from the "jungles and caves" where force alone ruled. We took over much of the planet by means of what we like to think of as our superior intelligence. Looking both ways before you cross a street isn't paranoia, it's a real part of evolution. 

This topic seems to bring out people with strong opinions. If you care to comment, please keep it civil, or move on.

I stay up watching Kpop vids until midnight, thinking about Luhan. Maybe I ripped up my posters up too soon. I pull out my earbuds and sludge to the bathroom to finish getting ready for bed. 

As soon as I get inside I hear talking coming from Luhan’s room. Light seeps through the door to the tile. There can only be one person in that room this time of night. Luhan. 

Ask any Kpoper and they’ll tell you―never miss a chance to find out more about your bias. Eavesdropping is totally harmless anyway. 

I tip-toe to the door, but I’m worried Luhan’s superhuman hearing will catch me. Hopefully he has some kind of weakness that allows him to only focus his hearing on one thing at a time. 

My ear presses to the chilled door. Good thing it’s hallow―I can hear right through. 

He’s speaking Mandarin, dang! I really wanted to know what he was saying. 

I’m about to walk away when I hear him switch to Korean. “I have to get the jewelry. It’s important.” 

Jewelry? What kind of Jewelry? 

“I know you have it. Don’t play dumb. I’m speaking Korean so there’s no misunderstanding. Now tell me.” 

Wait, is this some kind of henchman that stole something from him? 

“I know what I said,” he continues, “I changed my mind. I tried not to let the past get to me, but it has. I’m weak.” 

The past? Weak? What could it possibly mean? I run my hand down the door, wishing I could be closer to him. I wonder if his supernatural powers aren’t working as well here. Maybe the jewelry is some kind of amulet that restores his power. I don’t want him to suffer, especially around me. 

“Hang on a second,” He says. 

I go stiff. Shoot. Did he hear me? 

The door swings open and I stumble into his chest. He catches me with an arm around my back. I take my time meeting his eyes, embarrassed he caught me listening in. 

He holds my gaze. Breathing is impossible. 

“I’ll call you back,” he murmurs, letting the phone drop from his ear. 

He studies my face for a second and I know he’s going to say something mean. I don’t want to hear it so I straighten my spine and push out of his embrace. 

“You weren’t supposed to hear that,” he says in Korean. 

I knew it! He’s hiding something. 

My head bows. “I apologize” 

He breaths out hard through his nose, his jaw tight. “Just don’t do it again.” 

The door is shutting in my face, his back to me. 

He can’t leave like this. If I’m going to figure out what his deal is, I need to spend more time with him. There has to be something I can do to not make him hate me. 

“I can help you,” I blurt. 

Luhan’s shoulders stiffen, but he doesn’t turn around. This is going to be a long-shot, but I have to try. 

I need to convince him that he needs me. I don’t care what it takes. “I’ve lived in Portland most of my life. I know it better than most people. If you need someone to show you around or take you somewhere….” 

I know it’s lame, but I’m doing my best. 

He doesn’t move, the silence ballooning between us. I guess that’s my answer. It was worth a shot anyway. 

“Why should I let you?” he says after a second, tipping his head so I can see the edge of his profile. 

Yeah, I got nothing. I just want to be with you doesn’t seem like the right thing to say at the moment. 

“Because,” I whine, scrambling to come up with something. “I’m so adorable.” 

He turns a bit of his shoulder so he can see me better. 

I can’t believe I’m going to do this, but I’m pretty desperate. 

My fists go to my cheeks. A little aegyo can go a long way. His mouth softens, just a touch. 

“Bbuing, bbuing?” I venture. 

That’s all it takes, the corners of his mouth turn up and his famous sparkly eyes really do sparkle. I could look at that face all day. 

He turns around and grips the door so tight his muscles flex. 

“I’ll let you go with me on one condition.” 

Anything! I want to shout, but I still need to play it cool. “What’s that?” 

He narrows his eyes, his mouth a straight line. “You brush your hair and take off those hideous glasses.” 

Ice king has returned! I knew he couldn’t stay away for too long. 

“Don’t want to be seen in public with me, eh?” I joke. 

He swings the door so it only frames his face. “Exactly. I’ll decide after breakfast tomorrow.” 

With a click of the lock, he’s gone. 

My eyes naturally close as I sigh. Why do I let myself like him? It just brings me pain. 

* 
I wasn’t going to dress up. It’s so chauvinistic of him to think he can tell me how to look. 

I consider teasing my hair on purpose and keeping the fugly glasses. But the whole time I’m in the shower I keep thinking about the moment Luhan smiled at me. His whole face transformed. I really, really, want to see that smile again. Maybe if I attempt to look hot it’ll work. 

Yeah, I’m already laughing at myself. 

I take time picking out my outfit anyway. I find a blue blouse that hugs my non-existent curves and throw on some shorts. My fashion design mother would be proud. It’s been a while since I put on anything other than a t-shirt and jeans. 

Contacts in, hair done. I even put on lip gloss. I guess I look okay. Hopefully Luhan will let me go. I’m not really expecting anything. He’s one prickly pear. 

Walking down the stairs in my wedge sandals is harder than I remember. I take each step slow, holding onto the railing as I go. 

The first time I look up from my feet I see Luhan standing in the living room watching me. He looks like he’s holding his breath. I would say he’s mad, but that’s not quite the expression I’m sensing. My focus goes back to my feet, I can’t handle him staring that way. 

“Breakfast!” Mrs. Lu says when I reach the bottom step. 

Luhan walks with me side by side to the kitchen. Weird. I steal peeks at him, but he never looks my way. 

He sits across from me, but we never make eye contact. I really shouldn’t care about the things he does, but I do. He doesn’t even know how much I care. 

“Today we were thinking of going downtown,” Mrs. Lu says. 

Great, an awkward day with virtual strangers and Luhan sight-seeing the things I’ve already seen. Whoopie! 

Luhan clears his throat, fumbling with his napkin. “Abby and I already have plans today.” 

My parents were chatting, but they go silent. Even the music my mom put on this morning goes dead. Four sets of adult eyes are totally focused on us. I’m not even sure I heard that right. Did my dressing up really work? Sweet! 

A good ten seconds creep by before the next song starts playing from my mom’s ipod. The soft pounding of piano keys seems to snap everyone out of their stupor. 

Mr. Lu finds his voice first. “That’s great. You kids have fun.” 

I exchange a look with Luhan. Seems like our parents are ready to pick a wedding date. I wouldn’t mind, but I have a feeling Luhan would. I have to think about him too, but I’m just happy he actually volunteered me away from boring adult-ville. 

“What are you guys doing?” Mom says. Her smile is way too big to be natural. 

I can’t help but smile too. I’m going to help Luhan find his amulet of power so he can’t be weakened by America air…but of course I don’t say that out-loud. 

“Abby offered to show me around.” Luhan doesn’t even look at me as he says it. Man he’s a good liar. 

Our parents are trying not to look at each other, but I can sense their excitement. Might as well take advantage of that. 

“So I was wondering if I could borrow dad’s car,” I say. 
My father, however humble, is proud he owns a Mercedes. He never―ever―lets me drive it because if it gets scratched he’ll have a heart attack. 

Dad swallows hard then takes a long drag of water. This is going to be good. He can’t yell at me with our guests here. 

“I figured, since there are four of you and you’re going to downtown you’d want to take the SUV. It’s more practical that Han and I take the Mercedes.” 

“Makes sense to me,” Mr. Lu says. Thank goodness an adult agrees with me or else this won’t work. 

Dad is wiping his mouth with a napkin―his lips wired shut. 

“Abby,” Mom says in her gentle tone, “I’m not sure―” 

“Han is a very good driver,” Mrs. Lu throws in. 

Cha-ching! If Luan’s the one doing the driving, I totally have this in the bag. My dad thinks boys are inherently better at everything. Driving probably tops that list. 

Dad is gripping the table top, breathing deep through his nose. “How old are you again, Han?” 

“Uh,” Luhan says, looking between me and Dad. “We can take the bus.” 

“Nonsense,” Mr. Lu offers, “You two should have some time alone.” 

I don’t need any wedding presents, what the Lu’s are doing for me is enough. 

Luhan squirms in his seat. I can tell he doesn’t like what his parents are saying, but this is the chance of a lifetime, how can he not see that? 

“That should be fine,” Dad says in a whisper, his voice strained. He clears his throat. “Just let me grab my keys.” 

Is that a tear running down his cheek? It must take a lot of physical restraint for him to say yes. Personally, I think it’s about time he let go a little. 

He puts the keys in Luhan’s palm with both hands and holds tight. “Be nice to her, Son.” 

Luhan looks at me and I give him two thumbs up. “I will,” he says to Dad. 

But I’m not sure he means the words, he seems really worried about it. 
This day is just getting better. Mom is pushing us out the door, Luhan’s parents standing behind nodding their approval. Dad’s the only one with a frown on his face and that’s because of the car. 

All four of them stand on the porch waving to us as we back out. It’s really embarrassing, but it’s sweet at the same time. 

Luhan looks really uncomfortable. He’s keeping his elbows in as he drives and looking forward, not even glancing my direction. It’s quiet too―I’m terrified to turn the radio on. 

I know I’m the one who begged to come along, but he didn’t have to let me. The least he could do is at least try to make conversation. I’m not going to let that stop me from enjoying myself. This is a one sided love after all. I might as well make the most of it. 

I open and close the glove compartment a few times. Luhan’s driving with his knuckles tight to the steering wheel. When I glance at the speedometer 

I notice he’s going five under the speed limit. 

“You know that pedal to the right?” I say, pointing. “It makes the car go.” 

I see a flicker on his brow before his face goes smooth again. Cold as stone, that one. There has to be a way to melt him a little. 

“This car has a thing called a six-cylinder engine. That means it’s built to go really fast.” I smile, but Luhan isn’t looking at me.. 

I only know that six-cylinders are a lot faster than the usual four because Dad reminds me every single time I’m in the car with him. I can almost hear him telling me about the benefits of a Mercedes engine. Gag me. 

Luhan is still frozen, the speedometer not moving an inch. He’s just leaving himself open to more teasing. Since there’s no way Luhan will ever like me, I might as well say what’s on my mind. He obviously doesn’t want to talk to me anyway. 

“The funny thing is,” I say, laughing. “The car was built to actually move. When it doesn’t move, other drivers get upset. I promise pressing the gas won’t make it break.” 

Luhan’s hands grip the wheel tighter, his knuckles turning white. I’m having way too much fun bugging him about this. All my reading has made me sarcastic and maybe even a little sadistic. 

“Oh hey look,” I shout, “a snail passed us. That has to be a record or something,” 

Luhan bangs a fist on the wheel. “Will you shut up? I don’t know how to do this.” 

Hold the phone. “What?” 

“I’ve only driven a car like three times.” 

I’m a more experienced driver than Luhan? No way. 

“Pull over, right now. I thought your parents said you were a good driver!” 

Luhan isn’t stopping. “I’m not,” he says, “My manager drives me everywhere.” 

Shoooot. “My dad is going to kill you if he finds out. Pull over right now!” 

Luhan is still going straight. In fact, he hasn’t turned once since we got in the car, except when he backed up. 

I’m too afraid to ask the question on my tongue, but it must be said. “Don’t tell me you don’t know how to pull over.” 

A small laugh escapes as I say the words, but Luhan’s face is blank. “I’m afraid to turn the steering wheel too much.” 

Oh this is bad. This street ends in a few hundred feet. There’s a line of cars behind us, honking. 

“Okay,” I say, making a split second decision. “You just keep doing what you’re doing and I’ll take the wheel.” 

“Are you sure?” He says, his voice wobbling. 

“Let go, now!” 

This time I don’t wait for him to react, I grab his hands and pull us over to the curb. “The break, hit the break!” 

For once he listens. I throw the car in park the second we’re stopped, and lean back in my chair. I start to rub my hands down my face and sigh. Holy crap, I just had these hands on Luhan. I sniff my palms real quick and realize they smell like honey and fresh rain. Luhan smell. It’s amazing. Would it be weird if I kept my hands on my face for the rest of the day? 
I peek at Luhan through my fingers and notice he’s still ignoring me. Yep. I’m weird. 

“Okay,” I say clapping my hands together. “I’m driving.” 

Luhan still has his hands stuck to the steering wheel. I wave my fingers in front of his face, no response. 

Now I’m starting to doubt my superhuman theory. Would a superhuman be this terrified of driving? 

There’s only one thing to do. I peel off Luhan’s fingers one by one until he’s free. 

I’m about to give him his space, but he holds tight to my hand. Not in a romantic way. It feels urgent, pleading. 

“Did you see that?” he says, pointing out the window. 

I squint. Now, I know I don’t have the best vision in the world, but with my contacts I can see pretty well. All that’s in front of us are a few houses and a wooded area beyond that. 

“Han, I don’t—” 

“Look, look!” he says pointing faster. A bald eagle bursts through the tree tops and starts to circle upward. 

Whoa. How did he see that? 

Now I’m freaked out. He’s got to be some kind of something—I just haven’t figure out what that something is yet. 

I'm using airport wi-fi to post this right now, so I'm sorry I don't have the first two chapters in the comments today. I also apologize if I don't return comments as fast. I'm going to a writers conference for the rest of the week. 

Once again, if you want to win a story with you and your bias, mention a friend in the comments telling them to come read! Love you all :)

Since then, radiation has forced thousands out of their homes and led to the deaths of many. It took great effort to prevent the ultimate meltdown of the plant – but are the after effects completely gone? Tokyo says yes; it also claims the government is doing everything it can for those who suffered in the disaster. However, disturbing facts sometimes rise to the surface. To shed a bit of light on the mystery of the Fukushima aftermath, Sophie Shevardnadze talks to the former mayor of one of the disaster-struck cities. Katsutaka Idogawa is on SophieCo today. 
Follow @SophieCo_RT 
Sophie Shevardnadze: Mr. Idogawa, welcome to the program. Your town of Futaba was heavily dependent on cash coming in from the nuclear reactors and you yourself approved building more reactors. Did you believe back then, that something could go wrong? 
Katsutaka Idogawa: Yes, I suspected it might, but I didn’t expect an accident of such proportions. 
Read the full transcript 
SS: You’ve said before that you knew right away that the government, that TEPCO – the plant’s operator, would lie about the consequences of the accident at Fukushima. When did you lose trust in the authorities? 
KI: This was even before the accident, when I first came to see the management of the power plant. I asked them about potential accidents at a nuclear power plant, pretending I didn’t know anything about it, and it turned out they were unable to answer many of my questions. Frankly, that’s when it first crossed my mind that their management didn’t have a contingency plan. It was then that I realized the facility could be dangerous. 
SS: March 11, 2011 - the day the devastating earthquake and tsunami hit Japan...where were you that day? 
KI: I wasn’t in Futaba that day, but I was near. I went to a nearby town on business. That’s where I was when the earthquake hit. 
SS: What did you see around you? 
KI: As for the aftermath of the earthquake, there were no destroyed buildings or water pipes ripped out of the ground in the town where I was. But I saw all that on my way back to Futaba. As soon as it happened, I jumped into my car and drove to Futaba. I managed to get there before the bigger tsunami came. It was only later that I realized that I escaped the water... 
SS: When a catastrophe of this scale happens, I understand that it is very difficult to control your emotions, it is difficult to get a hold of yourself, take any action. What were your first actions? 
KI: The earthquake was very strong. I just kept thinking, “If it’s that strong, what will happen to the power plant? What if the reactor is damaged? What if the water leaks? What will the city do? What am I to do as mayor? 
SS:I can only imagine how much worry you felt at that moment. Do you remember what you did right after the disaster hit? 
KI: It took me 20-30 minutes to get back to my office in Futaba. There was a traffic jam, so I chose an alternative route along the coast. At that moment I wasn’t thinking about anything except the fact that I had to get back as soon as possible. I heard a tsunami warning on my car radio. Tsunami waves had never been higher than 60 cm before. I thought that even if it’s big, the wave would be about 6 meters at most. I had no idea the road I was on could be washed away by the tsunami. I got lucky. The tsunami came after I drove off that road and up the mountains. I got to my office in Futaba and started checking for damage. I walked around every floor, and on the 4th floor I looked out the window. Usually you couldn’t see the sea from there, but that time I could see it just 300-500 meters away. It was a truly terrifying sight. I had all these thoughts swirling in my head: “What should I do? How to evacuate people? Where do we run? How do we save ourselves?” Also, I realized that the power plant would be damaged, and I didn’t know what to do about it. Looking back, I think I didn’t deal with the crisis well enough. I think I didn’t ask myself enough questions. 
SS: As I understand, you gave orders to evacuate your city right away? 
KI: Yes. I didn’t sleep at all that night. I was watching TV, since it was the only source of information. I kept thinking what to do with radiation, how to inform and evacuate the people. Mobile phones didn’t work because there was no signal, so radio was the only way. On the morning of March 12, I announced an emergency evacuation. I assumed radiation would not reach the mountains and we would be safe if we left the city. I told the people to go to Kawamata, a town 50 km away. There’s just one road that goes there, and it was packed with cars. Later, I learned that not all the Futaba residents heard my announcement. I feel guilty about that. Back then, I believed that it would be safe to go to Kawamata, which was further away from the plant than the government-recommended 10-20 km. Later, I found out that Fukushima Prefecture hadn’t given me all the information in a timely fashion. And now the government isn’t taking any steps to ensure people’s safety from radiation and isn’t monitoring the implementation of evacuation procedures. 
SS: You decided to evacuate people from Futaba as far as possible without consulting anybody - so you completely assumed responsibility? 
KI: Our city always had an emergency plan in case of a fire or an accident at the plant. Every year, we had special drills in case there was a fire at the plant. I think it’s the central government and the Fukushima Prefecture authorities that bear the most responsibility for what happened. As mayor, it is my responsibility to take care of the people of Futaba. At that time, I had no time to get advice. I tried talking to the prefecture authorities but there was absolute chaos. It was impossible to get advice or hold a meeting. So I chose to act on my own, and I decided to start with evacuating the people as far from the radiation as possible. 
SS: Your town is moving to a new location, to the neighboring city of Iwaki. Is it safe there? Do you see this as a new start for the people? 
KI: I’d like to show you a table with radiation levels around Chernobyl. Radiation levels around Fukushima are four times higher than in Chernobyl, so I think it’s too early for people to come back to Fukushima Prefecture. Here you can see radiation levels in our region, Tohoku. This is ground zero, and the radiation radius is 50-100km, even 200km in fact. Fukushima Prefecture is at the very center. The city of Iwaki, where Futaba citizens moved, is also in Fukushima Prefecture. It is by no means safe, no matter what the government says. Exposing people to the current levels of radiation in Fukushima is a violation of human rights. It’s terrible. 
SS: Evacuation advisories are being lifted for some cities in the Fukushima area, but you’re saying that the government is allowing this, despite the danger of radiation? 
KI: Fukushima Prefecture has launched the Come Home campaign. In many cases, evacuees are forced to return. Here is a map of Fukushima Prefecture, with areas hit by radiation highlighted in yellow, and you can see that the color covers almost the entire map. Air contamination decreased a little, but soil contamination remains the same. And there are still about two million people living in the prefecture, who have all sorts of medical issues. The authorities claim this has nothing to do with the fallout. I demanded that the authorities substantiate their claim in writing but they ignored my request. There are some terrible things going on in Fukushima. I remember feeling so deeply for the victims of the Chernobyl tragedy that I could barely hold back the tears whenever I heard any reports on it. And now that a similar tragedy happened in Fukushima, the biggest problem is that there is no one to help us. They say it’s safe to go back. But we must not forget the lessons of Chernobyl. We must protect our children. I talked to local authorities in different places in Fukushima, but no one would listen to me. They believe what the government says, while in reality the radiation is still there. This is killing children. They die of heart conditions, asthma, leukemia, thyroiditis…Lots of kids are extremely exhausted after school; others are simply unable to attend PE classes. But the authorities still hide the truth from us, and I don’t know why. Don’t they have children of their own? It hurts so much to know they can’t protect our children. 
SS: I understand that many children who have been evacuated are now living in the Fukushima district again; new schools have opened for these children, and you say they are facing radiation there…Is anything being done to help the children affected by the nuclear fallout? 
KI: Officially, both the central government and the prefecture authorities say there is no radiation. They’re not doing anything, and they’re not going to do anything. They say Fukushima Prefecture is safe, and that’s why nobody’s working to evacuate children, move them elsewhere. We’re not even allowed to discuss this. 
SS: So after the tragedy, the government wanted to build nuclear waste storage facilities on the territory of Futaba. You were against that, but now, as I understand, these facilities are going to be built after all. Do you fear that that will prevent residents from ever returning to their town? 
KI: Media report it as the final decision has been made. But that’s not true. The problem is with the decision-making process. That’s why I keep saying no. The central government makes all the decisions by itself the way it pleases. It ignores the victims. Actually, we have a rule in our country saying that decisions can’t be made without taking people’s opinion into consideration, but the government ignores this rule and just does everything the way they see fit. After all, this matter is up to landowners. Unless they agree, nothing can happen. That’s how things work in Japan. And even though there’s been much speculation, nobody has talked to landowners yet. So media reports suggesting that the final decision has been made are premature. In reality, nothing has been decided. It is not clear at this point what will happen. All we know right now is that there will be repositories built and that land will be nationalized. Radiation is a big problem today but even this problem hasn’t been solved yet. Without consulting with us, with the people, that is, Fukushima Prefecture announced that people will be relocated from the prefecture for 30 years, but they failed to keep this promise as well. It’s all very unreasonable. All the unpopular decisions were made without us. That’s why I’ve been saying no all the time. 
SS: In the beginning of the program you touched upon the inability of TEPCO to manage the situation at the nuclear plant. They have been struggling to contain the situation for over three years now. Why are they failing? 
KI: That’s the way TEPCO works. The problem is with its structure. People working at the headquarters are in privileged conditions, but those working in the field work in very difficult conditions. That’s the way it was even before the accident. That’s how this company works. When the accident happened, TEPCO couldn’t give us or its own employees the names of the people responsible for the accident. They couldn’t do that because the company doesn’t have real professionals.Even before the accident, I would sometimes go to their office as mayor, ask them a lot of questions: “Do you train your personnel? Is everything okay? Is there any chance that your old equipment may fail?” In response, they only gave me a lot of nice words. But they didn’t take any practical steps; they hardly ever did anything. TEPCO thinks too high of itself, delegating almost everything to subcontractors. That’s why, when something happens, there’s nobody to be held accountable. In addition, the company doesn’t follow the situation on the ground. Even today, we received a report saying that they made a mistake and used the wrong pump, and as a result contaminated water ended up in a wrong place. As for the restoration of the city, I am really concerned about the future of my hometown, the future of Futaba. 
SS: Now, Japan’s homeless are among those recruited to take part in the major cleanup - are they a viable workforce in this case? Is this because there’s a lack of qualified workers, or because those people are considered sort of ‘disposable?' Is this even true? 
KI: Unfortunately, it’s true. If you use workers on a one-off basis, you don’t need to watch radiation; you don’t need to care about their health. We must respect people, care about them. When talking about the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, Prime Minister Abe likes to talk about Japanese hospitality, and he uses this Japanese word “omotenashi,” which literally means that you should treat people with an open heart. But we don’t see that in our situation. While Prime Minister Noda was preoccupied with self-promotion, authorities started caring less about people who worked at the Fukushima plant. Their equipment was getting worse; preparation was getting worse. So people had to think about their safety first. That’s why those who understood the real danger of radiation began to quit. Now we have unprofessional people working there. They don’t really understand what they’re doing. That’s the kind of people who use the wrong pump, who make mistakes like that. I’m particularly concerned about their leaders. It seems to me their crew leaders aren’t real professionals. They don’t know what they’re doing. I’m really ashamed for my country, but I have to speak the truth for the sake of keeping our planet clean in the future. 
SS: Does the fact that the government was covering up the real scale of the disaster for so long have anything to do with the traditional Japanese fear of losing face? 
KI: It’s just that they wanted to avoid responsibility. 
SS: No, I understand, but why keep this quiet for so long? They didn’t tell the world how bad it really was - why is that? 
KI: There were some sad chapters in the history of Japan. The same thing happened with Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The authorities lied to everyone. They said it was safe. They hid the truth. That’s the situation we are living in. It’s not just Fukushima. Japan has some dark history. This is a sort of a sacrifice to the past. 
SS: The United Nations report on the radiation fallout from Fukushima says no radiation-related deaths or acute diseases have been observed among the workers and general public exposed - so it’s not that dangerous after all? Or is there not enough information available to make proper assessments? What do you think? 
KI: This report is completely false. The report was made by a representative of Japan – Professor Hayano. Representing Japan, he lied to the whole world. When I was mayor, I knew many people who died from a heart attack, and then there were many people in Fukushima who died suddenly, even among young people. It’s a real shame that the authorities hide the truth from the whole world, from the UN. We need to admit that actually many people are dying. We are not allowed to say that, but TEPCO employees also are dying. But they keep mum about it. 
SS: Do you have an estimate of casualties? 
KI: Today I don’t have the numbers with me. 
SS: Mr. Idogawa, we only need an estimate, just to understand the scale of the tragedy you’re talking about. 
KI: It’s a huge responsibility to give specific numbers. It’s hard for me, because I haven’t studied this matter personally. But it’s not just one or two people. We’re talking about ten to twenty people who died this way. 
SS: You say that despite the Fukushima disaster, Japan is planning to build more nuclear reactors, eventually satisfying at least half of its energy needs with nuclear energy. Obviously you’re against that - but Japan really has no other choice in terms of energy, does it? 
KI: Yes, it has. Japan has plenty of rivers, but hydro energy is not used at all. Why? Because it’s not as profitable for big companies. Actually, we can provide electricity for a large number of people even with limited investment, without taxes. Just use gravity, and we may have so much energy that there’ll be no need for nuclear plants anymore. And we also need to change our laws. There are many laws in Japan, perhaps too many. There are laws about rivers and the ways they’re used. We could change laws regarding agricultural water use and start using rivers to produce electricity. Changing just this law alone will allow us to produce a lot of energy. We can solve the problem by using natural energy, without contaminating our planet. But this does not appeal to big companies, because you don’t need big investments, you don’t need to build big power plants. It’s not that profitable for investors, for capitalists. But people in Japan begin to realize that we need to avert nuclear disasters, so 60-70 percent of the population are in favor of using natural energy. It took us a long time, but one day we’ll follow the example of Europe, of Germany. 
SS: Have you personally felt the consequences of the catastrophe? Has your health been affected? 
KI: I now get exhausted quickly, it’s harder to speak, I often get colds. My eyesight worsened. I have a cataract. My stomach hurts. My skin is very dry. I have muscular weakness in different parts of my body. These are the consequences of the catastrophe. 
SS: Do you receive any treatment as a victim? 
KI: No, I’m not getting any treatment right now. Actually, there’s no place I could go for help. I now live in Saitama. The nearest hospital refused to treat me. So I’m trying to restore my health through nutrition."

This is why I came, wasn’t it? To be sure. I’m sure now. Funny how he can’t handle turning a steering wheel, but he can hear a bowl cracking and spot a bird in the middle of a forest. 

I want him to know I know, but there’s no easy way to go about that. Maybe if I ask him how he did it... 

“I hate birds,” he says, releasing my hand. 

My fingers feel cold now that he’s not longer clinging to me. I’m still leaning into him though, I don’t think I can ask him if I move too far away. 

“Han, how did you see that far?” 

There. It’s out. No going back now. I wonder if he saves people in his free time. 

“Birds of prey are especially frightening.” Is he avoiding the question? 

“I like to keep track of birds and stay away.” 

Um… not even close to the answer I was expecting. Was he even listening to me? 

He looks my direction for the first time since we got in the car. Our faces are nose to nose. He swallows and stumbles backward, opening the car door as he goes. The only thing that stops him from landing on his butt is his grip on the car handle. 

“Are you okay?” I say, leaning over the seat farther. 

His feet are backpedaling on the gravel to the side of the road. He slips, but misses landing flat on his back. 

“F—f—fine. I’m fine,” He says as he stands. He trips a little as he steps back, but recovers. 

I watch him walk around the car to my door, rubbing the back of his head and muttering to himself. This is the first time I’ve seen him be anything other than totally in control. 

Just before he gets to my door he stops and looks at his hands. I have no idea what’s going through his head right now. Maybe that whole thing with him not being able to drive and slipping out of the car was just because his powers aren’t working right and we need to find that amulet sooner. 

I open my door before he gets the chance to touch the handle. The door window almost hits him. “Sorry,” I say, scrambling to the other side. I just want to hurry to where we’re going so I can help him get better. 

He’s strapping his seatbelt as I slide into the driver seat. I’m ready to put the car in gear and peel out, but then I realize I’m lost. 

“Where are we going?” I say, focused on the road in front of me. 

“Uh—“ Luhan says, his voice distant. 

I blink and turn my head. “You do have a plan, don’t you?” 

He holds up a finger. “Yes, but—“ 

I raise both my eyebrows. I would raise just one eyebrow, but I’ve never been able to do that. 

“Um… do you know where 88th avenue is?” 

Why’re we going there? “Yeah, I used to live on that street. Why?” 

That’s the place where I knew Luhan as a child. Of course, back then I didn’t know he’d be a huge star… 

Luhan presses his lips together then releases them. He should not be allowed to do that so close to me, especially when I know I’m the only one thinking about us in any context other than friendship. But dang, that’s hot. “I need to talk to someone who lives there.” 

What if he discovered his powers when I knew him, and an old shaman in our neighborhood taught him how to control everything? We must be going there now to speak with the wise mentor who helped Luhan in his path to enlightenment. I can’t wait. 

There really aren’t that many houses on that street, I wonder who it could be? 

My family moved us out of the main city so it takes us a good half hour get to the address Luhan gives me. If he was still driving, we’d be dead. At least I’m good for something. 

“Oh,” I say, parking the car in the driveway and shutting the engine off. 

“I remember this house.” 

Mostly because it creped me out. There were so many trees in the front yard you couldn’t see the house. Now that I’m closer though, I see it’s actually nice. The front yard is just a little overgrown. 
Luhan taps his foot while we wait for the door to open. I smile at him and rock slowly to the balls of my feet. It almost feels like I’m just watching a gif of him online and soaking it all in. Only so much better. 
In all the madness of him coming here, and being a jerk, and the superhuman stuff, I’ve totally forgotten how much I like him. Like really like him. 

Let’s be honest here. I’m head over heels for the boy. Doesn’t matter if he’s a jerk or not—this is all temporary anyway. He leaves in two days and I’ll never see him again. 

For now I’m going to enjoy looking at him. This is a picture I don’t have to share with the rest of the world. It’s just me and him with the sun shining through the tree tops. I snap a mental photo and store it in my happy place. 

I think back to my childhood impression of him and I’m glad I’m wrong. He’s so beautiful, in-humanly beautiful. In fact, I’m certain it’s one of his superpowers. 

My feet go flat as the door opens. I’m standing to the side of the doorframe so I can’t see who’s there but he’s speaking rapid Mandarin and I don’t understand a word of it. 

Luhan pinches the fabric of my shirt and tugs me toward him. “Abby,” he announces. 

What the heck, this dude isn’t a shaman?! His age is somewhere in between me and Luhan. I don’t want to notice, but I can’t help but see how good looking this guy is—dark hair sweeping over his forehead and clear brown eyes that reflect the light. 

“Abby?” The guy in the doorway says. “Abby Eom?” 

I’m not sure what language to speak so I just nod my head. 
The guy steps out of the door, right between me and Luhan. He looks from my face, all the way down my body, then back up. 

“Dang Abby,” he says in English, “When did you get so hot?” 

Heat rushes to my cheeks. No one’s ever told me that before. He looks over his shoulder and says something to Luhan in Mandarin. 
“Ya!” Luhan says, flipping the stranger around. 

I step off the porch to give the fighting boys some room. No idea what’s going on here, I wonder if they have an old fight still happening. Is that why we came? 

Stranger dude says something to Luhan that calms him down and then brushes off his jacket. 

“Hi, I’m Shaun,” he says, stepping toward me. 

Glad to have a name with the face. Did I mention the face was good looking? Very good looking. It bugs me that I’m noticing it so readily. Because I just realized how much I like Luhan—even if I have no chance. 

Shaun extends his hand and I blush as our palms touch. Holy crap, I’m swooning over a complete stranger—in front of Luhan. Luhan, demigod of Asia! It’s so confusing. 

I let go of Shaun’s hand before I embarrass myself further. 

Luhan says something angry in Mandarin, and Shaun shoots me a wink. “Don’t mind him,” Shaun whispers in my ear, “he’s touchy.” 
Whoa. Chills. 

I stifle a giggle, but a little laughter snorts out. I still totally like Luhan. 
If I had a choice, I would pick Luhan every time, but I there’s no denying there’s attraction between me and Shaun. It’s nice to be liked, and I know all too well Luhan doesn’t have feelings for me. 

“Do you have it or not?” Luhan says in English. 

I’ve never heard Luhan speak that much English—this must be urgent. 

I have to focus, Shaun’s really making everything in my brain jumble up. 

“Let’s have a look,” Shaun says. He offers me his arm, “my lady.” 

I’m not sure I can stop blushing, even my ears are hot. It’s sweet, and so, so, perplexing. When I look at Luhan, I feel guilty, so I don’t take Shaun’s arm. 

That doesn’t stop Shaun though. He places his fingertips in the middle of my back and guides me into the house. 

Shaun gestures for me to sit on the loveseat, then takes the spot next to me. Right next to me. Our thighs are touching. No one has ever given me attention like this. I scoot over because Luhan is watching, but it’s not like Luhan wants to sit next to me. In fact, he sits on the other side of the room, as far from me as possible. It just confirms how Luhan feels about me. 

“You must be a saint if you’re hanging around Han,” Shaun says, closing the gap I created. 

I chuckle and lean away from him, but our thighs still touch. “It’s not so bad.” 

Luhan stands, wiping his palms on his pants. “I don’t want to be here longer than I have to,” he says in Korean. 

Shaun points to a cardboard box sitting on the coffee table and says “it’s in there.” Since Shaun speaks Mandarin and Korean, I guess he’s who Luhan was talking to last night. Shaun must have the amulet then. 

Luhan’s nostrils flare as he stares at the two of us. What is up with that look? All I’m doing is sitting. I guess I offend him or something. He probably only brought me along for transportation. I did tell him I knew my way around. He must’ve known he’d be lost without me. 

Luhan looks at me―says something in Mandarin―then takes the box out of the room with him. It doesn’t feel right. It feels so wrong I’m tempted to run after him. 

I start to stand, but Shaun pulls me back to couch. “He needs a minute.” 

Right. Luhan doesn’t know I’ve figured out his secret, he’s probably trying to hide the amulet of power for now. That’s fine with me, as long as he’s safe. 

“So, Abby,” Shaun says. “You don’t remember me, do you?” 

I swallow hard. Um, no. Do I have a reason to remember Shaun? I guess we lived on the same street when I was young, but it’s all a blur. 

Should I be honest with him? I suppose he has a reason to remember me since he even knew my last name. I want to lie, but I can’t make up memories that don’t exist. 

My words come out cautious. “No. I don’t.” 

Shaun nods his head. “Figures, you only cared about Han anyway.” 

So he knew the two of us together. I wonder how I’ve been missing Shaun all this time. 

“I was just the dorky kid who followed Han around,” Shaun says, his eyes going glassy. “Who would remember me?” 

Awe! Shaun looks all heartbroken and sad. I can’t let him be that way. 

“I’ll remember you now,” I offer, nudging him with my shoulder. 

His eyes snap to mine. “Really?” Beautiful, clear eyes. 

I smile wide. “Really, really.” 

Our legs are still touching, and suddenly I’m aware of the intense heat passing between us. Without Luhan in the room, I’m tempted to move closer. Did I mention Shaun is hot? 

“We should hang out sometime.” Shaun pulls out his phone. “What’s your number?” 

I’m holding my breath. So confusing! In any other circumstance I would say yes. Even now, I want to shout my number as fast as I can and have him text me for good measure so I know he has it. 

Today, however, Luhan is in the next room. It’s not like I have any shot with Luhan, ever. It makes zero sense considering the way Luhan has acted toward me at this point. I mean, I knew he was kind of arrogant, but in EXO showtime he was also cute, and funny, and just… my ideal guy. 

Not to mention I feel like I’m on the edge of a breakthrough. I want Luhan to confide his secret in me. If he does, we’ll be connected. Even if it’s not romantically. I just want to help him. 

So even though Shaun is really cute and I’m attracted, I can’t even give him my number until Luhan leaves. I have to know how things are going to play out first. 

“That’s really sweet―” I say,  but I’m cut off by Luhan dropping the box on the coffee table. 

Luhan is practicing being a sculpture again. He’s really good at it. 

“Let’s go,” he says in a monotone voice. 

I give Shaun a sideways look. Holy crap, our lips are centimeters from touching. Shaun seems to notice at the same time and he tips his chin up like he might actually kiss me. This would be a bad way to lose my virgin lips. Not in front of Luhan. 

I back up, but there’s nowhere to run unless I fall off the loveseat. Luhan grabs my wrist and saves me just as Shaun’s lips brush my cheek. 

Now I’m nose to nose with Luhan. I really don’t want him knowing how bad a crush I have on him, so I shove him away and walk out the door without looking back. Thank goodness I have the car keys so I can hide inside and hyperventilate. 

My head bangs the steering wheel. What just happened? I can’t even process it all. Shaun. Super mega hottie Shaun—who I can’t like—was going to kiss me. Then Luhan saved me, but I pushed him away. I may have just ruined my chances with two amazing guys. I’m so stupid. 
Leave it to me to wreck my reality just when it starts to get interesting.

http://redkiteprayer.com/2014/04/dear-johan/ 

It’s clear from your recent blog post on your site that you’re not happy with your 10-year ban from cycling. Big surprise. 
I’m going to let you in on a little secret: The rest of the world isn’t happy with that ban, either, but for reasons I suppose are very different from yours. You see, we all think you should have gotten a lifetime ban, just like your favorite son, Lance. He earned a lifetime ban and to most of us, your sins were just as great, your guilt just as proven, your responsibility even greater, so your punishment should have been just as high. 
Here’s another newsflash (I should mention I have a few more after this one): Your case before WADA regarding your role as the mastermind of the U.S. Postal Service team’s doping program has been as anticlimactic as the news of any of Hollywood’s elite walking out of court-ordered rehab after only a weekend. We all saw it coming, and in that, it was just as unsurprising as your reaction. 
That you have been banned from the sport for 10 years isn’t really news. That Michele Ferrari and Dr. Luis Garcia del Moral received lifetime bans for their efforts isn’t really news, either. And what of Dr. Pedro Celaya and Jose Marti’s eight-year bans? Definitely not news. 
Were this a movie about your former team, this would be footage you’d run under the credits. 
This is why your exhortations about USADA’s lack of jurisdiction over your career are falling on deaf ears. We don’t need anyone to explain the various agreements and bylaws that allow an organization in the United States to sanction a Belgian living in London. There may not be much in cycling we have faith in, but we do at least believe in those sanctions. 
You, like Lance, have lost the plot line. The public wanted clean sport and plausible deniability. It’s much the way we want government. We want no corruption and plausible deniability so that we can at least claim we have a working democracy. 
What neither you nor Lance seem to understand is that we, the public, recognize you rubbed our noses in your lies. The spell is broken. No matter how thrilling those Tour wins were, that entire era is now, collectively, the ex we can’t be in the room with. As breakups go, this was epic. We don’t want to see Lance on a bike ever again. We don’t want to see you speak into a microphone, anytime, anywhere. If we hear the word “win” come out of your mouth, we’re going to scream. All of us. 
Your statement on your blog opens really well. You say, “I do not dispute that there are certain elements of my career that I wish had been different. Nor do I dispute that doping was a fact of life in the peloton for a considerable period of time.” 
It’s such a great start. But you don’t go on to tell us what those things you wish were different were. You don’t confess your misdeeds. You don’t admit that you coerced numerous riders who would not otherwise have doped into doping. You don’t confess that you pitted the media against each other. You don’t reveal how you co-opted people into supporting the myth your team was built on. 
And you continue, “However, a very small minority of us has been used as scapegoats for an entire generation.  There is clearly something wrong with a system that allows only six individuals to be punished as retribution for the sins of an era. 
Did the US Postal team really operate ‘the most sophisticated, professional and successful doping program that sport has ever seen’? This headline-grabber has helped create a staggering industry of books and movies, but reveals only USADA’s talent for self-aggrandizement.” 
Dude, there’s this thing called hyperbole. It’s a handy device for getting a point across. You should check it out. All the cool kids are using it. Whether or not the USPS system was the most sophisticated—or not—is an unanswerable. It stands to reason that if there has been a more sophisticated system, we haven’t learned of it … because it was more sophisticated. But that, as they say, is beside the point. 
Which brings us back to you and Lance and your inability to comprehend public sentiment. 
Johan, here’s the deal. We don’t care if this was a kangaroo court that dismantled you and your legacy. The truth is out. Despite Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen calling Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis scumbags, their stories have carried the day. And trust us, you’re not scapegoats for an entire generation, you’re just the tip of the iceberg. Whether the CIRC—the UCI’s attempt to do a South African-style truth and reconciliation commission—drills down far enough into the past is a separate matter, but one we will take up with them, not you. 
I’m tired of writing about doping, tired of seeing someone cross the finish line and immediately calculating the odds of whether he was clean or not. I’m tired of defenses that continue to play the public for fools. 
You should go listen to some Bob Dylan. The times, they are a-changin’. Early this spring I spent a day interviewing a bunch of pros with the Cannondale team. The one truly interesting, truly surprising thing anyone said to me that day came from Ivan Basso. And you know what he said? 

“The young pros—they don’t ask about doping anymore.” 

Not only does the public want clean sport, even the athletes want it. Your failure to comprehend this most basic of truths is why your 10-year ban was not long enough. Even if you learn that lesson, there is zero chance we will ever trust you again, and that’s why your ban should have been for life.
