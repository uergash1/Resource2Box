Melanoma is a malignant tumor that originates in melanocytes , the skin cells that is responsible for the synthesis of melanin . Melanoma can occur in all parts of the body where melanocytes are normally present , then the skin of course, but also the mucous membranes , meninges, and the uvea . Has a higher incidence in the left side of the body. [1]

etiology 

The risk of developing melanoma is higher in individuals with fair skin ; UV rays contribute to the development of cancer , although it can occur in any area of ​​the body also is not irradiated . There is also a proportion of melanomas family. It may arise de novo or from preexisting nevus . They suspect a neoplastic growth changes in symmetry , border , color, size and extent ( horizontal and vertical ) of a preexisting nevus . It was also established that those who have already suffered from this cancer has a better chance of developing a second primary melanoma in the future [2]. In addition to excessive or early exposure to intense sunlight , other risk factors are immunosuppression , the use of UV lamps , the presence of multiple previous skin lesions . Contrary to what in some contexts ventilated area , use of oral contraceptives does not increase the incidence [3] , in the light of a comprehensive systematic review of 2010. 
Solar rays and melanoma 

Already in the middle of the twentieth century , thanks to studies in Australia on a sample of white men and black , was highlighted the correlation between the skin and exposure to sunlight. 
At the end of the eighties scientists proposed two triggers melanoma induced by the rays : the first is the mutation of specific genes of skin cells , resulting in cell proliferation and disabling of tumor suppressor gene ; The second is a disabling of the immune response of the skin. [4] 
Towards the end of the nineties , researchers have found that damage the DNA of skin cells , after long exposure to sunlight, suffers due to the ultraviolet B spectrum . While , typically , the cells unable to repair their DNA self-destruct (apoptosis) , a long exposure to the sun can alter the p53 gene , and then the cell "sick" continues to live and proliferate without limits. [4] Even the component UVA [5] , however, is related to the development of melanoma. 
epidemiology 

This tumor is seen to be slightly more common in women than men, the age of peak incidence ranging from 35 to 65 years (rare in childhood and adolescence ) . It is 17 times more common in people with light skin and in 5% of cases occur with multiple injuries . In the West, predominantly affecting the trunk in men and women in the limbs , neck , scalp and face . In men it is mostly blacks in the soles of the feet ( traumatic etiology ) . 
ABCDE Rule 

To identify possible melanomas , it is recommended to use the so-called ABCDE Rule [6] that it plans to bring to the attention of the doctor , however, that an alleged neo should have the following characteristics ( not necessarily all of these ) : 

    Asymmetry. Melanomas are usually asymmetric , with half of the stain the skin larger than the other . 
    Edges. The edges of melanoma are irregular in the map, as opposed to those of the . 
    Color. Melanoma is often multicolored or has different colors such as black, brown , red and pink. 
    Size . A suspicious skin lesions with a diameter greater than 6 mm should be checked by a specialist. 
    Evolution . The skin lesion that tends to change its shape, color and surface is considered suspect and monitor. 

In the case of nodular melanoma , the most aggressive changes in the Rule ABCDEFG adding features : 

    Elevation. It has taken relative to the plane of the skin. 
    Firm. The consistency , palpandola with your fingers, is greater than the surrounding skin . 
    Growing . Rapid growth in a few weeks or a few months. 

genetics 

The most frequently mutated genes in melanomas are: 

    p16 (the heterozygous mutation may be present in patients with familial melanoma ) 
    adhesion molecules ( cadherins and integrins ) 
    kit ( Oncogene ) 
    in advanced stages can also be mutations of EGFR , bFGF , IL-8 , fibronectin and other genes. 

Variety of melanoma 

In case of detection of a dark lesion , with different shades of color, with jagged edges and surface a little ' planed should always suspect the presence of melanoma and act accordingly. With progression of more or less rapid , the lesion can buy the ' appearance of one of the following melanomas [7]: 

    Lentigo maligna melanoma is uncommon (about 5-10% of cases), occurs mainly in older people, is localized especially to the face where it takes on the appearance of a stain that goes from pale brown to blackish brown , round or more often oval , which expands slowly and , without treatment, reaches the size of a large medallion . 
    Nodular melanoma : is not the phase of radial evolution , is presented beginning with vertical growth and often with metastases at diagnosis . It is found in 10-15% of patients with melanoma , mainly in males around 50-60 years. It can arise anywhere . It looks like a lump dome-shaped , brown or black. No symptoms. Sometimes it has the characteristic staining tumor , so the diagnosis is difficult. 
    Superficial spreading melanoma : is the most common (60-70 % of melanomas ) ; prefers the back in men and legs in women. Appears as a brownish stain difficult to distinguish from the rest of the skin, with colors ranging from dull red to blackish-brown , with margins rather marked . The lesion spreads like wildfire often showing small whitish areas of regression. After months or years , it takes more or less nodular appearance , ulcerandosi . This means that the cancer has gone from horizontal to vertical diffusion . 
    Acrolentigginoso Melanoma is the most rare type of melanoma in people with white skin . It is located at the ends of the limbs. Can go unnoticed for years. Merges with the lentigo maligna melanoma , but with an accurate diagnosis is possible to distinguish them . 
    Choroidal melanoma : localizes in the eyeball , or , more precisely in the membrane that covers the back of the eyeball . Its origin is due to many factors : it is likely the interaction of genetic and environmental factors for it to develop . Although not yet well known risk factors , it is clear predisposition in Caucasian and between the ages of 50 and 60. And ' more common in Australia ( continent very sunny , but populated by people of European origins of very light skin ) . Are affected about 500 people a year in Italy . Some argue a recent increase their intense caused by the use of cell phones or cordless phones . If you are not too developed , it is possible that radiation therapy preserves the look and some functions of the eye. They can generate , even if treated , metastases to the liver or other organs , sometimes even after several years . Melanomas arise in most cases from scratch , while in a small proportion develop starting from a lesion of a nevus eyepiece . 

In recent years, Europe has witnessed an alarming increase in this disease which, if not diagnosed in time, it can cause serious problems and lead to death. Among the risk factors, the most important role is certainly played by solar radiation , hence the importance of prevention and protection during sun exposure (especially in younger subjects and in relation to skin type ) [8] . 

The method most widely used and effective in the early diagnosis of melanoma dermoscopy and allows the observation of patterns not visible to the naked eye ; in the case of ocular melanoma , however , we use indirect ophthalmoscopic examination and ultrasound of the eye. 

The digital dermoscopy can provide a valuable diagnostic aid to the dermatologist based on objective assessments and in some cases even assisted diagnosis based on the analysis of images of systems and artificial intelligence. It is shown that these technologies based on computerized dermoscopy really contribute to an increase in terms of diagnostic accuracy provided scientifically validated through scientific journals. It has recently developed a sophisticated prediction method based on the analysis of sequences of images of pigmented skin lesions in order to provide detailed diagnostic frameworks based on the so-called mapping of snow . The follow-up of lesions plays such an ever greater importance in the early diagnosis of melanoma. 
The software detects the size , color variations , the depth of the mole and compares them with a database physician to determine the need for surgical excision and previous mappings in the patient to see the evolution over time. 
pathological anatomy 

Rarely found in the form of melanoma in situ . They are more frequent feedback microinvasive . Melanoma is characterized by a biphasic growth : radial and vertical . The radial growth is characterized by cells with clear cytoplasm , cellular atypia , mitotic not frequent , is not interested in the whole thickness of the epidermis , there may be groups of neoplastic cells below the basement membrane . The radial growth is still associated with a good prognosis . The vertical growth is a stadium instead of the more malignant tumor, is the most obvious and frequent atypia and mitosis , cells have acquired a strong impulse proliferative , occupy the entire thickness of the epidermis and may even reach the subcutaneous adipose tissue . This event is associated with increased risk of metastasis , given the intense vascularization that you are going down in the dermis. By immunohistochemistry it recognizes the positive for vimentin and S-100 protein . Often there may be an inflammatory response that reduces the size of melanoma, but does not change the prognosis . 
Sites of metastases 

The tumor metastizza frequently lymph node outside the region (59 % of cases) , lung (36 % ) , liver and brain ( both 20 % ) , bone (17 % ) . The spread can occur by continuity , through the lymphatic and hematogenous . 
diagnosis 

The essential elements to perform the diagnosis of melanoma are: 

    rapid changes in pigmentation and / or size (both increase and decrease , until the disappearance ) of a pre-existing mole 
    flat lesion with limits polycyclic net ; to " map" ( superficial spreading melanoma ) 
    pigmented nodule on the convex surface and clear boundaries ( nodular melanoma ) 

staging 
Classification of Clark 

Divide melanomas according to the deepest layer of the skin that invade : 

    First stage : the epidermis 
    Second and third stage : the papillary dermis 
    Fourth stage : the reticular dermis 
    Fifth stage : subcutaneous 

Breslow thickness 

This indicates the depth of penetration in mm tumor in the skin . It is the most reliable indicator of which correlates better with survival. [9 ] 

    Melanoma less than 1 mm , 7-year survival of 95% 
    Between 1 and 1.69 mm , low-risk melanoma 
    Between 1.70 and 3.99 mm , moderate-risk melanoma 
    Greater than 4mm , high-risk melanoma 

TNM staging 

If done dall'anatomo pathologist talking about pTNM . 
T 

    X: Not defined 
    0 : no evidence of primary tumor 
    1: thickness &lt;1 mm 
        to Clark level 2 or 3 without ulceration 
        b : Clark level 4 or 5 or the presence of ulceration 
    2 : thickness between 1 and 2 mm ( sublevels or b defined as before) 
    3 ( b sublevels as before) thickness between 2 to 3 mm 
    4 ( b sublevels as before) thickness greater than 4 mm 

N 

    0: no lymph node involved 
    1: 1 lymph node involved 
    2: 2 or 3 lymph nodes 
    3: more than 3 lymph nodes involved 

M 

M 0 /1: absence / presence of distant metastases 
prognostic Factors 

The main negative prognostic factors for melanoma include the presence of lymph node or distant metastases , ulceration , a high mitotic activity , the presence of satellite lesions and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase . Instead, it is a favorable prognostic factor the presence of a lymphocytic infiltrate around the tumor lesion ( TIL) . 
therapy 

Melanoma is a tumor with poor prognosis in advanced stages , so it would be preferable to recognize early forms with the tests described above and then proceed to excisional biopsy ; that allows you to remove the injury to virtually zero the risk of death. They are still available treatments to improve survival of patients who have not benefited from early diagnosis : 
adjuvant Therapy 

It is a treatment that is performed after removal of the primary lesion to reduce the risk of local recurrence . Has as its objective to increase the survival and increase the disease-free interval . Often these patients are included in clinical trials to test new treatments. 
immunotherapy 

Is to stimulate the immune system against the tumor. It is divided into different types: 

    active non-specific : use of substances that promote the inflammatory response at the local level . For example, interleukin-2 , interferon or Bacillus Calmette Guerin (normally used as a vaccine against tuberculosis , the bacterium is a very similar but more attenuated virulence ) 
    passive and specific : " I train " the immune system to fight against cancer cells availing of specially prepared vaccines . 
    administration of monoclonal antibodies ( used alone or conjugated with toxins or radioisotopes ) directed against the tumor 
    I favor cellular immunity ( the stimulus TIL) 
    Indirect : ( administer inhibitors of growth factors and angiogenesis ) 

The only one of these treatments approvado by the Food and Drug Administration is the use of ' high-dose interferon systemically in stages 2b and 3; but is burdened by serious side effects (fever and malaise in 70-80 % of patients caused by the systemic inflammatory response to this cytokine ) . Other treatments are used vaccines, but do not yet have reliable data on how the administration is unnecessary adjuvant chemotherapy classic . 
Therapy metastatic disease 

It makes use of immunotherapy described above as well as the following drugs in monotherapy : 

    alkylating agents ( dacarbazine ) 
    nitrosoureas ( carmustine , lomustine ) 
    derivatives of vinca rosea ( vincristine, vinblastine and taxol ) 
    platinum derivatives (cisplatin and carboplatin )
