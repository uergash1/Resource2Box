Nick's timing really couldn't be any worse when he visits Monroe, and emotions in Monroe's family are already running hot since Rosalee walks out in the middle of all of it because their choices break with tradition. 

This is one of the few episodes that begs, and later shoves under the rug, the question of Nick's reliance on Monroe. Nick has the Grimm ancestry and ability to dish out beatings to out of line Wesen on a daily basis, but Nick has almost zero experience when it comes to Wesen world and culture.

A nice one, but my doubts about the whole show grow every week. 
There are two great questions that need answer (or at least, questions about topic we need to see developed into the show): 
the first it's about the role of Grimm's chief. What is he, really? And what are his plans? What is he scheming? It seems it all has been forgotten... 
The second one it's very important: why every single monster\fairy\mutation\abnormal is in this fucking town? Since he's discovered his roots, Grimm has faced one "Grimm case" after the other, as if the town would be the central point of all the abnormal world. 
And that's absurd. 
It's kinda a Jessica Fletcher syndrome: for Jessica, the crimes came out where she was, for Grimm all the crimes involving abnormals happen in this town. 
Nonsense! 

It's like if the Fringe Division was the local police of Little Town, and everything happened in the show would have happened in the town, instead of in the whole world. 

Ah, and by the way... I don't think that awerewolf who lived by herself for nine years in the woods, since she was 7 yo, and who since then has spoken with no one, could return this easy in the normal world. It seems to me much more realistic that she would jump to the throath at someone, after nearly a couple of hours...﻿
