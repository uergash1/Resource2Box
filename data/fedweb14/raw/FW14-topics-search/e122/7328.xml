&gt; Warm the honey a little, if needed, to help with stirring. 
&gt; Mix until you get a smooth and uniform paste. 
&gt; Gently massage the paste with your index and middle fingertips on clean face, avoiding the eye area. 
&gt; Leave the mask on for about 15 – 20 minutes. 
&gt; Rinse off. 
Skin immediately feels smooth and radiant.
