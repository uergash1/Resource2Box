The May 2013 cover of Boston Magazine... 

shows a GIGANTIC HEART ❤ created from the ACTUAL running shoes worn by the Boston Marathon runners. Notice that the shoes are arranged by color with the RED and PINK ones in the middle. This was purposely done to give the feeling that the heart is "almost beating." 

This POWERFUL and CREATIVE photo was designed and shot by Mitchell Feinberg, an American photographer who has been shooting for important clientele, such as Louis Vuitton, Zegna, Bulgari, Mac, GQ and National Geographic...for a almost 20 years! 

According to photographer (Mitchell Feinberg): 
"This city (Boston) is my home. My love for it is boundless. Our home is hurting right now, and our hope, together, was to produce something that reflects the intensity of affection and pride that all of us here in the region feel for Boston". 

Boston Magazine editor (John Wolfson): 
"To me the cover is about two things: perseverance and unity. By itself, each shoe in the photograph is tiny, battered, and ordinary. 

Together, though, they create something beautiful, powerful, and inspirational. Remove just one shoe and you begin to diminish, in some small way, the overall effect. Collectively, they are the perfect symbol for Boston, and for our response to the bombings".

The joy of the annual Boston Marathon had been violently displaced by feelings of disbelief and confusion that were shared by residents and visitors. On the HMS campus, however, those feelings were quickly submerged, replaced by a need to help, a drive to serve, and a compulsion to undo the damage done to those who had been injured and traumatized.  HMS students and alumni recall the experiences of that day in “Sequelae,” from Harvard Medicine magazine: http://hvrd.me/1bVZ2gV

This sterling silver shoe tag features the words "Run for Boston 4-15-13." The idea is to thread the tag on one's running shoes. Welling says, "It is something runners can always have with them."
