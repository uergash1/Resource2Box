Dick Award. With &lt;i&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/i&gt;, William Gibson introduced the world to cyberspace--and science fiction has never been the same. &lt;P&gt; Case was the hottest computer cowboy cruising the information superhighway--jacking his consciousness into cyberspace, soaring through tactile lattices of data and logic, rustling encoded secrets ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7072-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7072_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 01:02:52">http://www.citeulike.org/user/RebeccaValentine/article/7328062</link><title>The social conditions, consequences and limitations of careers guidance</title><description>The recent influence of developmental theories of occupational choice upon guidance practice in Britain is criticised. It is suggested that people do not typically choose occupations in any meaningful sense: they simply take what is available. Moreover, the career of the typical industrial worker cannot be meaningfully understood in terms of self-actualisation and implementing a self-concept: guidance work based upon these concepts is accordingly unrealistic. An adequate theory for understanding school-leavers' transition to employment in Britain needs to be based around ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7072-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7072_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 01:04:01">http://www.citeulike.org/user/filipmarcinowski/article/11923663</link><title>John Bingham Roberts and the first American monograph on human brain surgery.</title><description>JOHN BINGHAM ROBERTS (1852-1924) of Philadelphia was an active general surgeon in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries. He made pioneering contributions to a number of areas of surgery. From 1880 until the end of his career, he was one of the few American surgeons to advocate an aggressive exploratory approach to cranial fractures in an effort to avoid consequences such as infection, delayed ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7072-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7072_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 01:04:53">http://www.citeulike.org/user/Quatrothelibrarian/article/6906758</link><title>Idoru</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7072-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7072_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 01:06:09">http://www.citeulike.org/user/kkentzo/article/2761003</link><title>The nature of selection</title><description>A model that unifies all types of selection (chemical, sociological, genetical, and every other kind of selection) may open the way to develop a general “Mathematical Theory of Selection” analogous to communication theory. [Note added by S. A. Frank:This previously unpublished manuscript was found among Dr. Price’s papers when he died in 1975. In this paper Dr. Price did not provide a complete, general theory of selection. Rather, he argued why such a theory is needed and what some of its ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7072-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7072_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 01:07:20">http://www.citeulike.org/user/elide8888/article/2670936</link><title>The WebQuest Creation Process: A Case Study of Preservice Teachers Working Individualistically or Collaboratively</title><description>This case study focused on preservice teachers creation of a WebQuest working in an individualistic or collaborative work configuration. Constructivism, adult learning theory, and collaborative learning, with technology integration in preservice teacher education provided the framework for this study. Data analysis revealed that mechanisms of collaboration occur in both configurations impacting the creation process and product. Emergent themes include individualistic configuration for control, collaborative configuration for mutual engagement, mechanisms of collaboration in collaborative and individualistic work configurations, prior experience from an ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7072-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7072_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 01:08:30">http://www.citeulike.org/user/mrybachuk/article/3991533</link><title>Educators Attitudes toward Online Professional Development</title><description>The importance of improving professional development is an ongoing issue. A growing body of research shows that improving teacher knowledge and teaching skills is essential to raising student performance. An important part of improving professional development is solving the problem of meeting the demand for professional development training. The traditional one-to-many training sessions and workshops have not kept pace with the needs of teachers and professional staff. As a result, web-based courses have often been turned to as a solution to ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7072-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7072_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 01:09:38">http://www.citeulike.org/user/suizan/article/210015</link><title>What Creativity Isn't: The Presumptions of Instrumental and Individual Justifications for Creativity in Education</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7072-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7072_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 01:10:46">http://www.citeulike.org/article/3181571</link><title>Populist Saints: B.

In the future, even this will not be enough. Successful businesses will create value by implementing innovations across organizational boundaries: [`]cross-functional' teams will become [`]cross-organizational' teams. Supply chain management will need to nurture successful innovation within these cross-organizational teams. The fundamental challenges are social rather than technical, involving issues of trust, co-operation, power and politics.
