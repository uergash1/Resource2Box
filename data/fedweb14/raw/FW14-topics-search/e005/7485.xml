The analysis reveals that, although the party executives are strongly invaded by public office holders, it is, contrary to expectations, not the party in public office but the party central office that emerges as the most predominant of the two faces. It appears that party organizations in these new democracies are largely controlled ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7485-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7485_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 21:39:40">http://www.citeulike.org/user/habraumann/article/3503762</link><title>Size and Party System Fragmentation</title><description>The present study tests the assumption that size affects party system fragmentation. Three dependent variables are used: the number of parties, the electoral support for the leading party, and the effective number of parties. The study operates on two levels. On the macro level, the research population consists of 77 countries with free party systems. On the micro level, local units in Great Britain and Finland constitute the object of research. The impact of the following intervening variables is controlled for: ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7485-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7485_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 21:40:10">http://www.citeulike.org/user/tkosaka/article/2402710</link><title>Political Party Adaptation in US Congressional Campaigns: Why Political Parties Use Coordinated Expenditures to Hire Political Consultants</title><description>We argue that political parties in the US have consciously opted to employ political consultants for their candidates' needs in order to help cultivate competitive national elections. Thus, consultant use by political parties does not signal party decline, but party adaptation. Further, the use of political consultants by the political parties is so complete that consultants can be considered employees of the political parties; not in the traditional sense of individuals on the payroll, but in the modern corporate sense ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7485-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7485_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 21:40:37">http://www.citeulike.org/user/tkosaka/article/2400882</link><title>The Changing Party of the Institutional Revolution: Electoral Competition and Decentralized Candidate Selection</title><description>We know little about how formerly hegemonic parties react to drastic changes in the external political environment. Under non-competitive electoral conditions, the Party of the Institutional Revolution (PRI) was characterized by centralized legislative recruitment and candidate selection that delivered a large percentage of coveted senate candidacies to national-level party politicians and bureaucrats. This centralized and nationalized recruitment gave the leader of the PRI enormous control over his wide-flung political elite. Since elections have become competitive, the PRI has decentralized its recruitment ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7485-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7485_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 21:41:12">http://www.citeulike.org/user/habraumann/article/3503763</link><title>The `Third Wave' of Democracy in Eastern Europe: Comparative Perspectives on Party Roles and Political Development</title><description>Political parties were not generally major actors in the early stages of democratization in eastern Europe, and their role has been a highly central but limited one in the politics of the region overall. How different has east European democratization been from earlier cases in this respect and how far has the contribution made by parties to the process changed? Their role is first examined in the framework of the `three waves of democracy' that developed in different historical and international ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7485-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7485_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 21:42:42">http://www.citeulike.org/user/Scis0000002/article/5778107</link><title>GraPHIA: a computational model for identifying phonological jokes.</title><description>Currently in humor research, there exists a dearth of computational models for humor perception. The existing theories are not quantifiable and efforts need to be made to quantify the models and incorporate neuropsychological findings in humor research. We propose a new computational model (GraPHIA) for perceiving phonological jokes or puns. GraPHIA consists of a semantic network and a phonological network where words are represented by nodes in both the networks. Novel features based on graph theoretical concepts are proposed and computed ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7485-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7485_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 21:44:25">http://www.citeulike.org/user/tkosaka/article/3464914</link><title>Pathologies or Progress? Evaluating the effects of Divided Government and Party Volatility</title><description>A vast body of literature emphasizes that successful political development relies on stable and united political parties that underpin clear and responsive policymaking. By this perspective, divided government and party volatility represent pathologies that imperil political accountability and development. Indeed, studies contend that divided government – where different parties control the executive and legislative branches of government – lead to policy deadlock while party volatility – characterized by frequent party splits, solo switches, mergers, dissolutions or the establishment of new parties ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7485-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7485_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 21:45:55">http://www.citeulike.org/user/ofse77/article/3157759</link><title>Cadre, Catch-all or Cartel?</title><description>10.1177/1354068896002004004 The recently proposed (ideal) type of a modern political party, the `cartel party', evokes questions both about the conceptual clarity of the new type and about its empirical validity. The analysis of the relationship between civil society and the state, which constitutes a central element in Katz and Mair's concept of the cartel party, is considered to be too static to grasp the increased intervention by the state in society. The application of a term derived from the level of ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7485-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7485_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 21:46:59">http://www.citeulike.org/user/biancametzler/article/9388449</link><title>Party Platforms and Party Coalitions</title><description>In this article, I make a first attempt at identifying how coalitions are represented in a state party’s platform. Using the Christian Right as a test case for Republican coalition membership, I further examine the notion that platforms reflect elite opinion coalitions by linking coalition group influence to both elite opinion and the structure of the party organization. Using state Republican Party platforms from 2000, I identify the extent of Christian Right influence on each platform based on the proportion of ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7485-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7485_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 21:48:11">http://www.citeulike.org/article/3989754</link><title>Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin: Current Strategies for Treatment and Prevention</title></snippet></snippets></search_results>
