Systems papers de3scribe performanhce of key subsystems required to capture or print pictures. The quality track brings together papers on the design of good image quality metrics, methods of measuring them and their applicaiton to complete systems. Image processing papers deal with halftoning, algorithms for reducing artifacts that degrade image quality, and some describe use of image processing to deliver features to the ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7454-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7454_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 16:59:08">http://www.citeulike.org/user/ThomasWilson2/article/6694894</link><title>InuYasha.

Whether senescence, like programmed cell death, can be exploited therapeutically has been unclear. Pandolfi and coworkers now propose that P TEN-loss- i nduced c ellular s enescence (PICS) may be triggered in vivo for therapy. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7454-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7454_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:00:43">http://www.citeulike.org/user/rgottardo/article/4198946</link><title>PICS: Probabilistic Inference for ChIP-seq</title><description>ChIP-seq, which combines chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel short-read sequencing, can profile in vivo genome-wide transcription factor-DNA association with higher sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution than ChIP-chip.

Clinicians refer patients to the PICS by completing the prescription and noting the patient's condition and any relevant factors. In response, PICS librarians critically appraise and summarize consumer-friendly materials into a targeted information report. Copies of the report are given to both patient and clinician, thus facilitating doctor-patient communication and closing the clinician-librarian ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7454-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7454_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:01:55">http://www.citeulike.org/article/10160061</link><title>Evaluation of the Parent-implemented Communication Strategies (PiCS) project using the Multiattribute Utility (MAU) approach</title><description>We conducted a multiattribute utility (MAU) evaluation to assess the Parent-Implemented Communication Strategies (PiCS) project which was funded by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). In the PiCS project parents of young children with developmental disabilities are trained and coached in their homes on naturalistic and visual teaching strategies to enhance their children’s social-pragmatic communication skills. This report focuses on the evaluation process, the application of the MAU approach to evaluate the PiCS project, the results of the evaluation, and a ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7454-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7454_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:02:30">http://www.citeulike.org/user/dandright/article/2811164</link><title>Cytokine mechanisms of central sensitization: distinct and overlapping role of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in regulating synaptic and neuronal activity in the superficial spinal cord.</title><description>Central sensitization, increased sensitivity in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons after injuries, plays an essential role in the induction and maintenance of chronic pain. However, synaptic mechanisms underlying central sensitization are incompletely known. Growing evidence suggests that proinflammatory cytokines (PICs), such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), are induced in the spinal cord under various injury conditions and contribute to pain hypersensitivity. Using patch-clamp recordings in lamina II neurons of isolated spinal cord slices, we compared the ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7454-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7454_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:02:49">http://www.citeulike.org/user/tnhh/article/12359946</link><title>Pics-on-wheels: Photo surveillance in the vehicular cloud</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7454-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7454_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:03:27">http://www.citeulike.org/user/chaotron/article/7329398</link><title>Large-Scale InP Transmitter PICs for PM-DQPSK Fiber Transmission Systems</title><description>We report here the first demonstration of a large-scale monolithically integrated InP-based 10-channel $times$ 45.6-Gb/s per channel transmitter photonic integrated circuit employing polarization-multiplexed differential quadrature phase-shift keying modulation format. ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
