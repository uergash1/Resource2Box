But though his courage won him a place at court and the heart of a lovely Princess, he was ill at ease with the normal ways of wizardry. Yet Pug's strange sort of magic would one day change forever the fates of two worlds. For dark beings from another world had opened a rift in the fabric of spacetime to being again the ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7018-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7018_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 16:38:58">http://www.citeulike.org/user/feist/article/9332784</link><title>Universal features in sequential and nonsequential two-photon double ionization of helium</title><description>We analyze two-photon double ionization of helium in both the nonsequential (ℏω&lt;I2≈54.4 eV) and sequential (ℏω&gt;I2) regime. We show that the energy spacing ΔE=E1-E2 between the two emitted electrons provides the key parameter that controls both the energy and the angular distribution and reveals the universal features present in both the nonsequential and sequential regime. This universality, i.e., independence of ℏω, is a manifestation of the continuity across the threshold for sequential double ionization. For all photon energies considered, the energy distribution ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7018-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7018_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 16:40:05">http://www.citeulike.org/user/feist/article/5355939</link><title>Probing Electron Correlation via Attosecond xuv Pulses in the Two-Photon Double Ionization of Helium</title><description>Recent experimental developments of high-intensity, short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light sources are enhancing our ability to study electron-electron correlations. We perform time-dependent calculations to investigate the so-called “sequential” regime ($\hbarω&gt;54.4$ eV) in the two-photon double ionization of helium. We show that attosecond pulses allow us not only to probe but also to induce angular and energy correlations of the emitted electrons. The final momentum distribution reveals regions dominated by the Wannier ridge breakup scenario and by postcollision interaction. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7018-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7018_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 16:41:22">http://www.citeulike.org/user/feist/article/2568575</link><title>Non-sequential two-photon double ionization of helium</title><description>We present accurate time-dependent ab initio calculations on fully differential and total integrated (generalized) cross sections for the non-sequential two-photon double ionization of helium at photon energies from 40 eV to 54 eV. Our computational method is based on the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and subsequent projection of the wave function onto Coulomb waves. We compare our results with other recent calculations and discuss the emerging similarities and differences.

We perform time-dependent ab initio calculations for pulses with mean frequencies in the so-called 'sequential' regime (o &gt; 54.4 eV). Electron correlation induced by the time correlation between emission events manifests itself in the angular distribution of the ejected electrons, which strongly depends on the energy sharing ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7018-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7018_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 16:43:26">http://www.citeulike.org/user/feist/article/6487638</link><title>Ab initio calculations of two-electron emission by attosecond pulses</title><description>Recent experimental developments of high-intensity, short-pulse XUV light sources are enhancing our ability to study electron-electron correlations.

Our approach combines the unique coherence properties of isolated atoms with the subwavelength manipulation and strong light-matter interaction associated with nanoplasmonic systems. It allows one to considerably increase the energy scales in the realization of Hubbard models and to engineer effective long-range interactions in coherent and dissipative many-body dynamics. Realistic imperfections and potential applications are discussed. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7018-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7018_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 16:48:15">http://www.citeulike.org/user/khm/article/13131559</link><title>Moving Through Time: The Role of Personality in Three Real-Life Contexts</title><description>In English, two deictic space-time metaphors are in common usage: the Moving Ego metaphor conceptualizes the ego as moving forward through time and the Moving Time metaphor conceptualizes time as moving forward toward the ego (Clark, 1973). Although earlier research investigating the psychological reality of these metaphors has typically examined spatial influences on temporal reasoning (e.g., Boroditsky &amp; Ramscar, 2002), recent lines of research have extended beyond this, providing initial evidence that personality differences and emotional experiences may also influence how ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
