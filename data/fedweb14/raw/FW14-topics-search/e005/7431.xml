Five-year survival rates approach 70% with surgical resection of stage IA disease; however, more than 75% of individuals have incurable locally advanced or metastatic disease, the latter having a 5-year survival of less ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7431-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7431_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 14:01:37">http://www.citeulike.org/user/matthewtam/article/10055982</link><title>Endovascular aneurysm repair versus open repair in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR trial 1): randomised controlled trial.</title><description>Although endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has a lower 30-day operative mortality than open repair, the long-term results of EVAR are uncertain. We instigated EVAR trial 1 to compare these two treatments in terms of mortality, durability, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and costs for patients with large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7431-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7431_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 14:03:39">http://www.citeulike.org/user/matthewtam/article/10055984</link><title>Endovascular aneurysm repair and outcome in patients unfit for open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR trial 2): randomised controlled trial.</title><description>Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was introduced for patients of poor health status considered unfit for major surgery. We instigated EVAR trial 2 to identify whether EVAR improves survival compared with no intervention in patients unfit for open repair of aortic aneurysm. We did a ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7431-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7431_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 14:06:56">http://www.citeulike.org/user/guhjy/article/8145516</link><title>B vitamins in patients with recent transient ischaemic attack or stroke in the VITAmins TO Prevent Stroke (VITATOPS) trial: a randomised, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial.</title><description>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies suggest that raised plasma concentrations of total homocysteine might be a risk factor for major vascular events. Whether lowering total homocysteine with B vitamins prevents major vascular events in patients with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack is unknown. We aimed to assess whether the addition of once-daily supplements of B vitamins to usual medical care would lower total homocysteine and reduce the combined incidence of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and death attributable to vascular causes in ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7431-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7431_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 14:07:37">http://www.citeulike.org/article/9982200</link><title>Design, history and results of the Thiazolidinedione Intervention with vitamin D Evaluation (TIDE) randomised controlled trial</title><description>Aims/objective Conflicting data regarding cardiovascular effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and extra-skeletal effects of vitamin D supported the need for a definitive trial. The Thiazolidinedione Intervention with vitamin D Evaluation (TIDE ) trial aimed to assess the effects of TZDs (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) on cardiovascular outcomes and the effects of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) on cancers and mortality. Methods A large multicentre 3 × 2 factorial double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial recruited from outpatient primary care and specialty clinics in 33 countries. From June ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7431-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7431_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 14:08:50">http://www.citeulike.org/article/4746242</link><title>Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of the Acetylcystein for Contrast-Induced nephropaThy (ACT) Trial: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy</title><description>Background: Aceltylcysteine has been evaluated in several small trials as a means of reducing the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), however systematic reviews of these studies do not provide conclusive answers. Therefore, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to provide a reliable answer as to whether acetylcysteine is effective in decreasing the risk of CIN in high-risk patients undergoing angiographic procedures. Methods: ACT is a RCT of acetylcysteine versus placebo in 2,300 patients at-risk for CIN undergoing an intravascular angiographic procedure.

We determined the effects of ramipril and rosiglitazone on combined and individual CVD and renal outcomes in people with IGT and/or IFG in the Diabetes REduction Assessment With ramipril and rosiglitazone Medication (DREAM) trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--A total of 5,269 people aged [≥]30 years, with IGT and/or IFG without known CVD or renal insufficiency, were randomized to 15 mg/day ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7431-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7431_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 14:12:32">http://www.citeulike.org/user/tkaczor/article/5323042</link><title>Vitamin K supplementation in postmenopausal women with osteopenia (ECKO trial): a randomized controlled trial.</title><description>BACKGROUND: Vitamin K has been widely promoted as a supplement for decreasing bone loss in postmenopausal women, but the long-term benefits and potential harms are unknown. This study was conducted to determine whether daily high-dose vitamin K1 supplementation safely reduces bone loss, bone turnover, and fractures. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This single-center study was designed as a 2-y randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, extended for earlier participants for up to an additional 2 y because of interest in long-term safety and fractures.

Although there have been many randomised controlled trials of manipulation and exercise for the management of low back pain, the role of these two treatments in its routine management remains unclear. A previous trial comparing private chiropractic treatment with National Health Service (NHS) outpatient treatment, which found a benefit from chiropractic treatment, has been criticised because it did not take treatment location into account. There are data to suggest that general exercise ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
