A popular example of open innovation has been open source software (OSS). The key issues facing organizational decision makers considering OSS strategies is, how does the firm create value for the customer while simultaneously extracting value for itself? However, the adoption of OSS as part of an open innovation strategy is a recent phenomenon and many unanswered questions remain. Taking the viewpoint ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7411-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7411_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 21:33:39">http://www.citeulike.org/user/alanebeatrizvermelho/article/9787343</link><title>The ecology of open-source software development</title><description>Open Source Software (ass) is an innovative method of developing software applications that has been very successful over the past eight to ten years. A number of theories have emerged to explain its success, mainly from economics and law. We analyze a very large sample of ass projects and find striking patterns in the overall structure of the development community. The distribution of projects on a range of activity measures is spectacularly skewed, with only a relatively tiny number of projects ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7411-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7411_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 21:34:46">http://www.citeulike.org/user/iCeGS/article/9401850</link><title>Beyond Reasonable Doubt: A Guide to Designing Experiments in the Behavioural Sciences</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7411-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7411_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 21:35:53">http://www.citeulike.org/user/nbalamurugan/article/2176819</link><title>Growth and characterization of sulphamic acid single crystals grown by Sanakaranarayanan-Ramasamy (SR) method</title><description>By directional solidification, single crystal of Sulphamic acid (SA) was successfully grown from aqueous solution by Sankaranarayanan-Ramasamy (SR) method. A vertically designed L-bend was used to avoid the effect due to spurious nucleation. A vertical bottom-seeded ampoule was used for the growth of single crystal. A seed crystal was mounted at the bottom of the ampoule. Sulphamic acid crystals of up to 40 mm in diameter and 60 mm in length have been grown with a growth up to 10 mm ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7411-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7411_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 21:36:43">http://www.citeulike.org/user/vmantas/article/5037467</link><title>Community for Innovations: Developing an Integrated Concept for Open Innovation Open IT-Based Innovation: Moving Towards Cooperative IT Transfer and Knowledge Diffusion</title><description>This paper presents a research project called GENIE. It aims at developing a concept for integrating external stakeholders into a company’s innovation management through a virtual community. This novel instrument for opening up a company’s innovation process to external stakeholders enables collaborative creation and implementation of innovations along the entire innovation process. We focus on software companies and aim at developing and testing this approach in several real-world settings. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7411-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7411_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 21:39:04">http://www.citeulike.org/user/xmarquez/article/12356451</link><title>The Discreet Charm of Lenin</title><description>This article takes two postcards of Lenin as their point of departure to ask about articulations of Soviet history as image and kitsch. I am especially interested in the ways in which the dead body or mummy of Lenin comes to symbolize an imagined social coherence that accrues specific political significance after the demise of the Soviet Union. In looking at Lenin's mummy as a site of memory and key to understanding contemporary Russian political desires, the article offers one analytical ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7411-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7411_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 21:40:41">http://www.citeulike.org/user/benvanzee/article/8402490</link><title>WHAT LENIN ATE</title><description>This article is an attempt to make V.I. Lenin a little less geometric by addressing a topic overlooked by most of his biographers: his attitude towards food and the nature of his diet. Based largely on his wifes &lt;span class="roman"&gt;Reminiscences&lt;/span&gt; and their letters to his relatives, it discusses who did the cooking in the Ul′ianov household, where Lenin ate, what he ate and what he drank. It suggests that he did not view meals as social or business occasions and that ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7411-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7411_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 21:41:58">http://www.citeulike.org/group/13894/article/8960164</link><title>Open educational practices and resources: OLCOS Roadmap 2012</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7411-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7411_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 21:42:53">http://www.citeulike.org/user/tcook202/article/5346766</link><title>Can Knowledge Management be Open Source?</title><description>As we move further into a knowledge economy where collaboration and innovation are increasingly central to organisational effectiveness, enterprises need to pay more attention to the informal networks that exist within the organisation. Wikis may provide a more appropriate knowledge management capability and environment to capture tacit knowledge. Where traditional organisational cultures see that knowledge management must be tightly protected, Wikis opt for an open source approach where knowledge is shared and distributed for innovation to continue.
