The origin of this activity is a subject of a number of model experiments and theoretical studies on either clusters of a few atoms in size or extended surfaces (smooth or stepped). In the work described here, a classical theory for the variation of the metal workfunction with cluster size, Extended Hückel Theory (EHT) calculations combined ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7499-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7499_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:42:28">http://www.citeulike.org/article/3477509</link><title>Gold and Gold Alloy foams</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7499-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7499_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:43:28">http://www.citeulike.org/user/kkentzo/article/2761003</link><title>The nature of selection</title><description>A model that unifies all types of selection (chemical, sociological, genetical, and every other kind of selection) may open the way to develop a general “Mathematical Theory of Selection” analogous to communication theory. [Note added by S. A. Frank:This previously unpublished manuscript was found among Dr. Price’s papers when he died in 1975. In this paper Dr. Price did not provide a complete, general theory of selection. Rather, he argued why such a theory is needed and what some of its ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7499-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7499_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:44:01">http://www.citeulike.org/article/4395523</link><title>Gold-catalysed synthesis of polypyrrole</title><description>This article is currently available as a free download on IngentaConnect ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7499-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7499_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:44:59">http://www.citeulike.org/article/4395520</link><title>Gold catalysis in Southern Italy</title><description>This article is currently available as a free download on IngentaConnect ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7499-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7499_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:45:47">http://www.citeulike.org/article/3866406</link><title>A review on fulminating gold (Knallgold)</title><description>This article is currently available as a free download on IngentaConnect ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7499-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7499_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:46:56">http://www.citeulike.org/article/1789759</link><title>Protein Binding to Gold Colloids</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7499-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7499_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:47:30">http://www.citeulike.org/article/1079979</link><title>Gold in Polyaniline: Recent Trends</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7499-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7499_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:48:10">http://www.citeulike.org/article/896892</link><title>Chrysotype: Photography in Nanoparticle Gold</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7499-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7499_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:49:41">http://www.citeulike.org/user/muhittinbosar/article/647367</link><title>Microbial Production of Gold Nanoparticles</title></snippet></snippets></search_results>
