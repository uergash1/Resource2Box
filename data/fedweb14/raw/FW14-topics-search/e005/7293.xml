Our understanding of the biosynthetic pathway that produces these compounds in the plant, however, has remained incomplete. Several lines of basil (Ocimum basilicum) produce volatile oils that contain essentially only one or two specific phenylpropene compounds. Like other members of the Lamiaceae, basil leaves possess ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7293-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7293_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 17:44:32">http://www.citeulike.org/user/kengg/article/3102976</link><title>Characterization of geraniol synthase from the peltate glands of sweet basil.</title><description>The monoterpene fraction of the lemon-scented sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) cv Sweet Dani consists mostly of citral (a mixture of geranial and neral), with lower levels of geraniol and nerol. These compounds are stored in the peltate glands found on the leaf epidermis. Younger leaves, which have a higher density of such glands, also have a higher content of monoterpenes than older leaves. Geraniol synthase (GES) activity, generating geraniol from geranyl diphosphate, was shown to be localized exclusively or almost exclusively ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7293-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7293_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 17:44:57">http://www.citeulike.org/user/mrkn/article/12657690</link><title>Recipe recommendation using ingredient networks</title><description>The recording and sharing of cooking recipes, a human activity dating back thousands of years, naturally became an early and prominent social use of the web.

Is More Affected by Leaf Position than by Leaf Age</title><description>The aroma in sweet basil is a factor affecting the commercial value of the crop. In previous studies leaf age was considered to be a factor that influences the composition of essential oil (EO). In this study it was hypothesized that a single observation of the EO content in leaves from different positions on the main stem (young vs old) could predict the developmental changes in the plant during its life cycle. Plants harvested at week 16 demonstrated an exponential increase ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7293-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7293_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 17:49:35">http://www.citeulike.org/user/lucybuykx/article/10238448</link><title>A personalized recipe advice system to promote healthful choices</title><description>We present a prototype of a personalized recipe advice system, which facilitates its users to make health-aware meal choices based on past selections.

It takes the reader from the colonial era through the liberation movements to independence and beyond. It faces squarely the disappointments and breakdowns that have dulled the early successes of the post-colonial era; yet, for all the sorrows and uncertainties of Africa today, Basil Davidson shows how much has been achieved since decolonization, and the mood of his new final chapter is hopeful ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7293-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7293_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 17:55:58">http://www.citeulike.org/user/lucybuykx/article/11862352</link><title>The Recipe, the Prescription and the Experiment</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7293-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7293_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 17:56:23">http://www.citeulike.org/user/mrkn/article/7108094</link><title>Intelligent food planning: personalized recipe recommendation</title><description>As the obesity epidemic takes hold across the world many medical professionals are referring users to online systems aimed at educating and persuading users to alter their lifestyle.

However, in general, cooking recipe texts have little flexibility. So, it is not always easy to retrieve cooking recipe texts that satisfy users' various demands. Therefore, it is necessary to create and offer recipes that suit the user's requirements. In this paper, we propose a method for finding replaceable materials considering characteristic cooking actions from a large amount of cooking recipe texts. The proposed method finds ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
