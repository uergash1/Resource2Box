Those who know one or two aspects of the Eameses' work are often surprised to learn just how far and vast their range extended. Yet throughout their myriad works, from architecture and furniture to exhibition and design and ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7069-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7069_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 00:29:20">http://www.citeulike.org/user/phillipkent/article/11668377</link><title>An Eames Primer</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7069-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7069_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 00:30:18">http://www.citeulike.org/user/phillipkent/article/11668380</link><title>Eames Design</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7069-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7069_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 00:31:25">http://www.citeulike.org/article/11274377</link><title>Exact two-point resistance, and the simple random walk on the complete graph minus edges</title><description>An analytical approach is developed to obtain the exact expressions for the two-point resistance, and the total effective resistance of the complete graph minus N edges of the opposite vertices.
