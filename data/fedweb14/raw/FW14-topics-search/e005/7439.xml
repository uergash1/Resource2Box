In particular, it is almost certainly the case that the demand for real-world evidence will drive increased demand for CER analyses of observational data. Although a great deal of progress has been made in the development and application of statistical methods for the analysis of observational data, the ordinary least ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7439-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7439_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 15:16:15">http://www.citeulike.org/user/Mander/article/1648100</link><title>Learning to Make Pottery in the Prehispanic American Southwest</title><description>Recent studies of apprenticeship and learning provide a framework for understanding how the social contexts of learning affect the material outcome of the learning process among potters. Using methods derived from educational psychology to examine prehispanic pottery made and painted by unskilled potters from the American Southwest, it is possible to evaluate cognitive maturity and motor skills. Comparisons of two culture areas indicate differences among Southwestern populations in teaching frameworks and how children were incorporated into craft production. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7439-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7439_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 15:16:47">http://www.citeulike.org/user/guhjy/article/2874430</link><title>How can we assess outcomes of clinical trials: the MCID approach.</title><description>Interpreting changes in outcomes of clinical trials in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be viewed from a broader perspective than only the statistical significance of the findings. The minimal clinical difference in outcome measures provides a conceptual framework to assist in clinical trial interpretation and a methodology to assess the clinical relevance of study results. Use of distribution-based techniques, comparison with other external measures, and opinions from experts, clinicians and patients can assist in minimal clinically important difference development. Although the ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7439-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7439_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 15:17:27">http://www.citeulike.org/user/pcp/article/254255</link><title>Recursive make considered harmful</title><description>For large UNIX projects, the traditional method of building the project is to use recursive make. On some projects, this results in build times which are unacceptably large, when all you want to do is change one file. In examining the source of the overly long build times, it became evident that a number of apparently unrelated problems combine to produce the delay, but on analysis all have the same root cause. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7439-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7439_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 15:18:04">http://www.citeulike.org/article/7819203</link><title>Theres a Reason They Call Them Dummy Variables: A Note on the Use of Structural Equation Techniques in Comparative Effectiveness Research</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7439-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7439_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 15:19:15">http://www.citeulike.org/user/phoebeC/article/8061818</link><title>Advertising law and regulation</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7439-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7439_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 15:20:21">http://www.citeulike.org/user/yangcheng30/article/3909868</link><title>Solvent Effects on Crown Ether Complexations1</title><description>doi: 10.1021/jo952250h A comprehensive study of complexation between potassium salts and 18-crown-6 in 14 different solvents shows stability constant K increases by &gt;104 from water to pure methanol or to propylene carbonate (PC), with constants increasing in the order H2O &lt; HMPT &lt; DMSO &lt; DMF &lt; MeCHOHMe &lt; MeCN &lt; Me2CO &lt; MeOH &lt; PC.

In vitro reassociation experiments using either dental tissues or bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) have been designed to get information about the mechanisms to be preserved in order to allow crown engineering.
