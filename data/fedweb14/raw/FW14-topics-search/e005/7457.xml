A swarm is a dynamic pattern of individuals in space. The structure of a musical composition is shaped in advance of the performance, but the organization of a swarm is emergent, without pre-planning. What use, therefore, might swarms have in music? ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7457-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7457_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:19:08">http://www.citeulike.org/user/phlow/article/952883</link><title>Natural language processing of lyrics</title><description>We report experiments on the use of standard natural language processing (NLP) tools for the analysis of music lyrics. A significant amount of music audio has lyrics. Lyrics encode an important part of the semantics of a song, therefore their analysis complements that of acoustic and cultural metadata and is fundamental for the development of complete music information retrieval systems. Moreover, a textual analysis of a song can generate ground truth data that can be used to validate results from purely ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7457-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7457_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:20:01">http://www.citeulike.org/user/LACannon/article/8011654</link><title>Impact of Music, Music Lyrics, and Music Videos on Children and Youth</title><description>Music plays an important role in the socialization of children and adolescents. Popular music is present almost everywhere, and it is easily available through the radio, various recordings, the Internet, and new technologies, allowing adolescents to hear it in diverse settings and situations, alone or shared with friends. Parents often are unaware of the lyrics to which their children are listening because of the increasing use of downloaded music and headphones. Research on popular music has explored its effects on schoolwork, ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7457-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7457_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:20:38">http://www.citeulike.org/user/wangxinxi/article/8405010</link><title>Rhyme and style features for musical genre classification by song lyrics</title><description>How individuals perceive music is influenced by many different factors. The audible part of a piece of music, its sound, does for sure contribute, but is only one aspect to be taken into account. Cultural information influences how we experience music, as does the songs â€™ text and its sound. Next to symbolic and audio based music information retrieval, which focus on the sound of music, song lyrics, may thus be used to improve classification or similarity ranking of music. Song ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7457-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7457_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:21:15">http://www.citeulike.org/group/17327/article/4146365</link><title>Music Psychology and Music Theory: Problems and Prospects</title><description>Music theorists and music psychologists may benefit from increasing awareness of each others' discipline. However, it is necessary to delimit the common ground shared by the disciplines and, at the same time, to clarify basic differences between the two approaches. Toward this end, this article begins with a schematic history of the psychology of music from the point of view of how it has been influenced by music theory. Following this is a brief characterization of the goals, methods, and theoretical ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7457-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7457_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:21:50">http://www.citeulike.org/group/18/article/158511</link><title>LyricAlly: automatic synchronization of acoustic musical signals and textual lyrics</title><description>We present a prototype that automatically aligns acoustic musical signals with their corresponding textual lyrics, in a manner similar to manually-aligned karaoke. We tackle this problem using a multimodal approach, where the appropriate pairing of audio and text processing helps create a more accurate system. Our audio processing technique uses a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, combining the strength of low-level audio features and high-level musical knowledge to determine the hierarchical rhythm structure, singing voice and chorus sections in the ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7457-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7457_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:22:19">http://www.citeulike.org/user/alonihill/article/6690548</link><title>The Canadian Music Journal : Special issue : Organs and organ playing in Canada.</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7457-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7457_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:22:52">http://www.citeulike.org/user/FelipeSeiti/article/10674750</link><title>Computer Music Composition Based on Discovered Music Patterns</title><description>Computer music composition has been the dream of the computer music researcher. In this paper, we investigated the approach to discover the rules of music composition from given music objects, and automatically generate a new music object style similar to the given music objects. The proposed approach utilizes the data mining techniques to discover the rules of music composition characterized by the music properties, music structure, melody style and motif. A new music object is generated based on the discovered rules. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7457-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7457_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:23:17">http://www.citeulike.org/user/triciapadlanwilliams/article/4041916</link><title>Debating Assessment in Music Education</title><description>Music education organizations achieved a huge success in Texas several years ago when legislation declared music as a part of the core curriculum. Similarly, more recent national education legislation like No Child Left Behind has recognized music as a core curricular subject. Since that time, little has been done to assess music students to ensure a set of basic skills and knowledge is being achieved. While national and state music standards exist, these standards, in many cases, are not mandatory and ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
