As noted by others, the strength of the dipolar coupling between water protons and the protein-bound nitroxide radical often appears to be larger than physically reasonable when the relaxation is assumed to be controlled by 3-dimensional diffusive processes in the vicinity of the spin label. We examine the ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7460-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7460_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:40:21">http://www.citeulike.org/user/zmarty/article/8429198</link><title>Identifying Differences in News Coverage between Cultural/Ethnic Groups</title><description>Large-scale analysis over historical news corpora provides us with unique opportunities to examine sociological issues with respect to local and mass media. In particular, we combine the Lydia named entity recognition system with an name-based ethnicity classification engine to examine issues of ethnic and geocentric sentiment/coverage bias in newspapers. We describe new methods for ethnicity and nationality detection for news entities (people), and build on this to identify interesting temporal, geospatial, and association trends in the coverage with respect to 13 ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7460-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7460_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:40:44">http://www.citeulike.org/user/kroncb00/article/8003043</link><title>Water and backbone dynamics in a hydrated protein.</title><description>Rotational immobilization of proteins permits characterization of the internal peptide and water molecule dynamics by magnetic relaxation dispersion spectroscopy. Using different experimental approaches, we have extended measurements of the magnetic field dependence of the proton-spin-lattice-relaxation rate by one decade from 0.01 to 300 MHz for (1)H and showed that the underlying dynamics driving the protein (1)H spin-lattice relaxation is preserved over 4.5 decades in frequency. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7460-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7460_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 17:41:29">http://www.citeulike.org/user/MaineC/article/5043997</link><title>Meme-tracking and the dynamics of the news cycle</title><description>Tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the Web has been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events. We develop a ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
