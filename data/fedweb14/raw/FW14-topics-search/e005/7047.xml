Such flexibility requires controlling the propagation of access rights, enforcing fine-grained access rights and supporting the revocation of previously granted access rights. Previous systems are lacking in at least one of these areas. In this paper we present an operating system security architecture that solves these problems. Control over propagation is provided by ensuring that the security policy ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7047-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7047_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 21:08:03">http://www.citeulike.org/user/nathanielvirgo/article/201409</link><title>Maximum entropy production and the fluctuation theorem</title><description>Recently the author used an information theoretical formulation of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics (MaxEnt) to derive the fluctuation theorem (FT) concerning the probability of second law violating phase-space paths. A less rigorous argument leading to the variational principle of maximum entropy production (MEP) was also given. Here a more rigorous and general mathematical derivation of MEP from MaxEnt is presented, and the relationship between MEP and the FT is thereby clarified. Specifically, it is shown that the FT allows a general orthogonality ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7047-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7047_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 21:09:10">http://www.citeulike.org/user/heiko_reese/article/2389425</link><title>The Flask Security Architecture: System Support for Diverse Security Policies</title><description>Operating systems must be flexible in their support for security policies, providing sufficient mechanisms for supporting the wide variety of real-world security policies.

To help address these difficulties, this study focuses on modeling single-vehicle motorcycle crashes in Ohio using a full Bayesian negative binomial model with mixed effects, creating a model structure that accounts for some of the uncertainty inherent in the data.

This simulation bears important similarities to a real ocean case, the Zapiola Anticyclone (ZA). The simple physics of the model allow the identification of two controlling parameters of the topographic circulation: bottom friction and eddy diffusivity. The role of these parameters was predicted in the theory proposed by Dewar [Dewar, W.K., 1998. Topography and barotropic transport control by bottom friction. J. Mar.

Tracking the early evolution of synapses has not been possible without genomic information from the earliest branching animals. As the closest extant relatives to the Eumetazoa, Porifera (sponges) represent a pivotal group for understanding the evolution of nervous systems, because sponges lack neurons with clearly recognizable synapses, in contrast to eumetazoan animals. ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
