As Wade Clark Roof notes, such changes over the last two decades reflect a shift away from religion as traditionally understood to more diverse and creative approaches. But what does this splintering of the religious perspective say about Americans? Have we become more ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7500-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7500_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:51:14">http://www.citeulike.org/article/5403222</link><title>A Separate Peace?

We highlight two key concepts that contain valuable information about the tangle of a density matrix: the zero polytope is a convex set of density matrices with vanishing tangle whereas the convex characteristic curve readily provides a nontrivial lower bound for the convex roof and serves as a tool for constructing the convex roof outside the zero polytope. Both concepts are ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7500-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7500_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:54:29">http://www.citeulike.org/user/maelorin/article/2104931</link><title>4.

Measurements of the thermal conditions throughout a roof profile on a building partially covered by solar photovoltaic (PV) panels were conducted in San Diego, California. Thermal infrared imagery on a clear April day demonstrated that daytime ceiling temperatures under the PV arrays were up to 2.5 K cooler than under the exposed roof. Heat flux modeling showed a significant reduction in daytime roof heat flux under ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7500-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7500_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:57:19">http://www.citeulike.org/article/3665505</link><title>Jeffrey J.

They represent a new and growing market for the horticulture field, but require vegetation tolerant of harsh environmental conditions. Historically, Sedum species have been the most commonly used plants because, with proper species selection, they are tolerant of extreme temperatures, high winds, low fertility, and a limited water supply. A greenhouse study was conducted to determine how water availability influences growth and survival of a ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7500-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7500_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 23:59:14">http://www.citeulike.org/user/bjbraams/article/12838467</link><title>Experimental Determination of Atomic Scattering Factors</title><description>The atomic scattering factor for aluminum has been experimentally re‐examined. First‐order corrections for the effect of temperature, surface roughness, primary extinction, secondary extinction, and anomalous dispersion were applied to experimental absolute intensity measurements made on a powder slab of aluminum. The average deviation between the experimentally determined and the theoreticalatomic scattering factor for aluminum is 0.16 electron. The slightly different shape of the experimental curve, as compared to the theoretical curve, is interpreted as evidence for a greater contraction in the ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
