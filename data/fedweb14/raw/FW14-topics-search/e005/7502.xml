This first born child to mother educated upto middle school and father tailor by occupation was brought from a remote village 180 kms away from JIPMER. Poor feeding, focal clonic seizures were the initial symptoms. The fundus examination revealed fresh preretinal and vitreous hemorrhages. CT Brain showed right sided subdural hemorrhage with subarachnoid extension and midline shift. He had a normal platelet count and coagulation profile.

The phase change material (PCM) used in this study is n-eicosane and is placed inside a heat sink made of aluminium. Aluminium acts as thermal conductivity enhancer (TCE), as the thermal conductivity of the PCM is very low. The heat sink acts as an energy storage and a heat-spreading module. Studies are conducted ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7502-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7502_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:10:09">http://www.citeulike.org/article/9327384</link><title>Non-Enzymatic Amperometric Glucose Biosensor from Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles Decorated Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7502-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7502_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:10:44">http://www.citeulike.org/article/6197396</link><title>SiO2 coated Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticle dispersed multi walled carbon nanotubes based amperometric glucose biosensor</title><description>A new type of amperometric glucose biosensor based on silicon dioxide coated magnetic nanoparticle decorated multi walled carbon nanotubes (Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 /MWNTs) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) has been developed. MWNTs have been synthesized by catalytic chemical vapour decomposition (CCVD) of acetylene over rare earth (RE) based AB 3 alloy hydride catalyst. The as-grown MWNTs have been purified and further functionlized. Functionalized MWNTs have been decorated with magnetic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles which ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7502-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7502_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:11:17">http://www.citeulike.org/article/6217539</link><title>Induction of systemic resistance to Exobasidium vexans in tea through SAR elicitors</title><description>Abstract  The effect of two chemical elicitors (acibenzolar-S-methyl benzo-[1,2,3]- thiadiazole-7-carboxylic acid S-methyl ester [Boost 500SC]) and salicylic acid in inducing resistance in tea plants against blister blight disease caused by Exobasidium vexans Massee, was studied. Treatments with elicitors resulted in reduced severity of blister blight disease in nursery plants on challenge with the pathogen. There was a significant increase in the activities of defense enzymes like phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase and β-1,3-glucanase on elicitor treatments in tea leaves challenged with the pathogen ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7502-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7502_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:11:49">http://www.citeulike.org/user/swarnchatterjee/article/6796550</link><title>Determinants of Risk Tolerance in the Baby Boomer Cohort</title><description>Using data from 26,759 respondents, this study examined the differences in financial risk tolerance among leading baby boomers and trailing baby boomers. The study also investigated differences between these two sub-cohorts in perceived risk tolerance and measured risk tolerance as determined by the FinaMetrica Risk Profiling System. The results of this study found that leading boomers were less risk tolerant than trailing boomers. Variables with a positive association with risk tolerance for both groups include higher educational attainment, income, net worth, ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7502-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7502_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:12:37">http://www.citeulike.org/article/9573984</link><title>Enhanced convective heat transfer using graphene dispersed nanofluids</title><description>Nanofluids are having wide area of application in electronic and cooling industry. In the present work, hydrogen exfoliated graphene (HEG) dispersed deionized (DI) water, and ethylene glycol (EG) based nanofluids were developed. Further, thermal conductivity and heat transfer properties of these nanofluids were systematically investigated. HEG was synthesized by exfoliating graphite oxide in H2 atmosphere at 200°C. The nanofluids were prepared by dispersing functionalized HEG (f-HEG) in DI water and EG without the use of any surfactant. HEG and f-HEG were ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7502-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7502_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:13:33">http://www.citeulike.org/user/galinro/article/7911187</link><title>Will the Boomers Volunteer During Retirement? Comparing the Baby Boom, Silent, and Long Civic Cohorts</title><description>Data from the 1995 and 2005 waves of the Midlife in the United States panel study were used to compare rates of volunteering among the baby boomers with earlier cohorts and to predict boomers' future volunteering. When age was kept constant through the use of panel data, the first baby boom cohort (born 1946 to 1955) did more volunteering than did the “silent” cohort (born 1936 to 1945), and the silents volunteered more than did the “long civic” cohort (born 1926 ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7502-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7502_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:14:12">http://www.citeulike.org/user/heatherrobinson/article/9631755</link><title>The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative and breast feeding rates in Scotland</title><description>Objective: To examine the effect of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative on breast feeding rates in Scotland.Design: Observational study using an annual survey of progress towards the WHO/UNICEF Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative and routinely collected breast feeding rates gathered on the Guthrie Inborn Errors Screening card at 7 days of postnatal age.Setting: Scotland, UK, population 5.1 million, with about 53 000 births a year.Participants: All 33 maternity units with over 50 births per annum and 464 246 infants born in Scotland ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7502-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7502_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-25 00:15:16">http://www.citeulike.org/user/agebhar1/article/9414771</link><title>Automated Software Testing Using Metahurestic Technique Based on An Ant Colony Optimization</title><description>Software testing is an important and valuable part of the software development life cycle. Due to time, cost and other circumstances, exhaustive testing is not feasible that's why there is a need to automate the software testing process. Testing effectiveness can be achieved by the State Transition Testing (STT) which is commonly used in real time, embedded and web-based type of software systems. Aim of the current paper is to present an algorithm by applying an ant colony optimization technique, for generation of optimal and minimal test sequences ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
