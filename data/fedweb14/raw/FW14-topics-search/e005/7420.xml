The advent of the smartphone--an integration of the mobile phone with an ultraportable computer, web browser, multimedia player, and camera, has given clinicians the capability to merge their information and communication resources into one compact handheld instrument. Apple's iPhone, and its sister device, the iPod touch, with a combined customer base of more than 50 million users and more than 100,000 downloadable applications, are ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7420-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7420_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 23:33:27">http://www.citeulike.org/user/wakeels/article/5864930</link><title>iPhone</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7420-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7420_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 23:33:59">http://www.citeulike.org/user/rezash/article/10997138</link><title>Assessment in Game-Based Learning</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7420-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7420_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 23:34:45">http://www.citeulike.org/user/Gaetan/article/7425835</link><title>Searching PubMed on an iPhone or iPod Touch</title><description>An increasing number of students and faculty come to campus with an iPhone or iPod touch. Aside from recreational use, these devices can be used to search for medical literature, but picking the right applications for searching can be difficult. A comparison test was created to find the best application for searching PubMed from an iPhone or iPod touch. The products tested were PubSearch, PubMed on Tap, and PubMed for Handhelds. Although equally accurate, PubMed on Tap was the superior product ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7420-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7420_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 23:35:52">http://www.citeulike.org/user/keller91711/article/1838010</link><title>A Game of Hearts</title><description>ft to implement the decision making functions for passing cards, for choosing the lead and for following the suit. I separated these functions into the separate file "control.c" and called them respectively PickPassCard(), PickDumpCard(), PickAnyCard(), PickNoHeartCard() and PickSuitCard(). Through these functions my player is communicating with the external world. The player program is split into two classes: the Agent class and the Engine class. The Engine class is the external class that... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7420-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7420_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 23:37:31">http://www.citeulike.org/user/tjhickey/article/9007002</link><title>Game design for ad-hoc multi-touch gameplay on large tabletop displays</title><description>This paper examines game design for multi-touch enabled systems, focusing on tabletop computers that are exposed to the public. We first elaborate on the requirements for ad-hoc collaborative multi-touch gameplay. As our main contribution, we identified particular gameplay aspects and formalized them in reference to formal elements of gameplay: The game mechanics should support different scopes of involvement and make use of spatial conflicts that relate to the player resources. The game should further offer outcomes that can be achieved in ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7420-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7420_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 23:37:54">http://www.citeulike.org/user/mattjb/article/1597681</link><title>Game Theory, Complexity And Simplicity Part III: Critique and Prospective</title><description>this paper. The details are not important here. What is important is that they all have been essentially normative solutions. Given that we require that a solution satisfies various axioms concerning efficiency, symmetry, bargaining power, additivity and other conditions, then the solution tells us which set of outcomes have the required properties. The Nash noncooperative equilibrium can also be considered axiomatically where efficiency is given up but mutual consistency of individual... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7420-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7420_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 23:39:26">http://www.citeulike.org/user/dtsamis/article/5156097</link><title>Game theoretic rate control for mobile devices</title><description>Modern mobile devices offer increased connectivity to heterogeneous wireless networks such as WiFi and 3G. These networks typically exhibit high variability in their characteristics, which poses extra challenges to applications developed to run over them. To address this issue, we propose a game-theoretic rate control scheme for mobile devices. In this noncooperative game formulation of the system the users are assumed the to be selfish in terms of their resource (bandwidth) requests. The information requirements within the model are then simplified ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7420-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7420_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 23:42:00">http://www.citeulike.org/user/yulele08/article/8825105</link><title>An Analysis of the iKee.B iPhone Botnet</title><description>We present an analysis of the iKee.B (duh) Apple iPhone bot client, captured on November 25, 2009. The bot client was released throughout several countries in Europe, with the initial purpose of coordinating its infected iPhones via a Lithuanian botnet server. This report details the logic and function of iKeeâ€™s scripts, its configuration files, and its two binary executables, which we have reverse engineered to an approximation of their C source code implementation. The iKee bot is one of the latest ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
