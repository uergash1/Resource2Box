This prospective study examined the agreement among measures of adherence to oral antipsychotic medications among 52 outpatients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Participants were assessed at baseline during a visit to their outpatient clinic and followed for 12 weeks. Adherence was assessed by using subjective measures (self-report and physician report) and objective measures (pill counts conducted in the home, electronic ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7143-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7143_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:38:44">http://www.citeulike.org/user/kathoughton/article/5139097</link><title>Does stigma keep poor young immigrant and U.S.-born Black and Latina women from seeking mental health care?</title><description>Stigma-related concerns are most common among immigrant women and may partly account for underutilization of mental health care services by disadvantaged women from ethnic minority groups. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7143-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7143_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:39:05">http://www.citeulike.org/user/edkay/article/5101875</link><title>Changes in use of valproate and other mood stabilizers for patients with schizophrenia from 1994 to 1998.</title><description>OBJECTIVE: The study describes changes over time in the adjunctive use of valproate and other mood stabilizers-lithium, carbamazepine, and gabapentin--among hospitalized psychiatric patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. METHODS: For each calendar year from 1994 through 1998, data were drawn from a database containing clinical and drug prescription information for every inpatient in the adult civil facilities of the New York State Office of Mental Health. RESULTS: In 1994 a total of 26.2 percent of inpatients diagnosed as having schizophrenia received ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7143-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7143_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:39:25">http://www.citeulike.org/user/kelanyu/article/1677198</link><title>Learning from hotlists and coldlists: towards a WWW information filtering and seeking agent</title><description>We describe a software agent that learns to find information on the World Wide Web (WWW), deciding what new pages might interest a user. The agent maintains a separate hotlist (for links that were interesting) and coldlist (for links that were not interesting) for each topic. By analyzing the information immediately accessible from each link, the agent learns the types of information the user is interested in. This can be used to inform the user when a new interesting page becomes ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7143-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7143_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:39:50">http://www.citeulike.org/user/scis0000001/article/819265</link><title>Http://www.merl.com</title><description>This paper identifies a broad class of nonlinear dimensionality reduced (NLDR) problems where the exact local isometry between an extrinsically curved data manifold M and a low-dimensional parameterization space can be recovered from a finite set of high-dimensional point sampels. The method, Geodesic Nullsapce Analysis (GNA), rests on two results: First, the exact isometric parameterization of a local point clique on M haas an algebraic reduction to arc-length integrations when the... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7143-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7143_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:40:16">http://www.citeulike.org/user/zwang/article/4238937</link><title>Does influenza transmission occur from asymptomatic infection or prior to symptom onset?</title><description>A better understanding of transmission dynamics is essential in influenza pandemic planning. If a substantial proportion of transmissions were to occur during the presymptomatic phase or from asymptomatic individuals, then infection control measures such as contact tracing and quarantine of exposures would be of limited value. Infectiousness has been inferred based on the presence of influenza in the upper respiratory tract rather than from transmission experiments. Although asymptomatic individuals may shed influenza virus, studies have not determined if such people effectively ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7143-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7143_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:40:41">http://www.citeulike.org/user/gculbert/article/4026043</link><title>Effect of release from prison and re-incarceration on the viral loads of HIV-infected individuals.</title><description>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of release from prison and subsequent re-incarceration on the viral loads of HIV-infected individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). METHODS: Fifteen re-incarcerated HIV-infected prisoners on HAART were identified from a retrospective cohort of HIV-infected prison inmates released from January 1, 1997, to August 31, 1999. The re-incarcerated prisoners were matched (1:2) to 30 HIV-infected incarcerated prisoners on HAART who remained incarcerated during the re-incarcerated participants' release time period.

To explore the implications of excluding records with missing income, we examined characteristics of survey participants with and without income information. METHODS: Using statewide population-based postpartum survey data from the California Maternal and Infant Health Assessment, we compared the age, education, parity, marital status, timely prenatal care initiation, and neighborhood poverty characteristics of women with and without reported income data, overall, ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7143-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7143_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:41:20">http://www.citeulike.org/user/ewhitc2/article/4071766</link><title>Substance use and abuse by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders: preliminary results from four national epidemiologic studies.</title><description>OBJECTIVE: The authors analyzed four recent large national surveys to assess the degree of use and abuse of a wide range of psychoactive substances across subgroups of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) and in comparison with whites. METHOD: The surveys analyzed were the 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, the 1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey, and the 1995 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health In-School and In-Home surveys. The AAPI sample sizes varied from 900 to more than ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
