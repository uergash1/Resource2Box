In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, starvation for amino acids induces phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha by Gcn2 protein kinase, leading to elevated translation of GCN4, a transcriptional activator of more than 50 genes. Uncharged tRNA that accumulates during amino acid limitation is proposed to activate Gcn2p by associating with Gcn2p sequences homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS) enzymes. Given that eIF-2alpha ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7019-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7019_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 16:50:48">http://www.citeulike.org/article/4226946</link><title>The eukaryotic initiation factor-2 kinase pathway facilitates differential GADD45a expression in response to environmental stress.</title><description>Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2) regulates general and gene-specific translation in response to diverse environmental stresses. Central to gene expression induced by eIF2 phosphorylation is the preferential translation of ATF4, a basic zipper transcription activator. Phosphorylation of eIF2 and its attendant induction of ATF4 can lead to different patterns of gene expression depending on the environmental stress. This is of fundamental importance because eIF2 kinases can induce the expression of genes involved in survival as well as in apoptosis.

The results expand our understanding of the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and provide new targets for prevention and treatment of obesity. Weight gain often results in the development of insulin resistance—a metabolic state that reduces the ability of cells to take up glucose from the blood in response to normal circulating ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7019-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7019_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 16:54:46">http://www.citeulike.org/article/5274063</link><title>The syntax of wek (‘which’) and zuk (‘such’) in West Flemish</title><description>This paper discusses the derivation of WF nominal constructions containing interrogative wek ‘which’ and demonstrative zuk ‘such’. Wek and zuk are often followed by what looks like a singular indefinite article, even when they associate with plural or non-count nouns. This use of the article is referred to as the spurious article (Bennis et al., 1998). It is proposed that wek and zuk originate as the (XP) predicates of ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7019-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7019_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 16:56:08">http://www.citeulike.org/user/hplatero/article/2148871</link><title>Juxtaposition of domains homologous to protein kinases and histidyl-tRNA synthetases in GCN2 protein suggests a mechanism for coupling GCN4 expression to amino acid availability.</title><description>The GCN2 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae stimulates the expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes under conditions of amino acid starvation by derepressing GCN4, a transcriptional activator of these genes. GCN2 contains sequences homologous to the catalytic domain of protein kinases. We show here that substitution of a highly conserved lysine in the presumed ATP-binding site of this domain impairs the derepression of histidine biosynthetic genes under GCN4 control. This result supports the idea that protein kinase activity is required for GCN2 ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7019-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7019_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 16:57:23">http://www.citeulike.org/article/7154298</link><title>Obesity: stressing about unfolded proteins</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7019-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7019_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 16:58:42">http://www.citeulike.org/article/4208263</link><title>Parasite-specific eIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor-2) kinase required for stress-induced translation control.</title><description>The ubiquitous intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii (phylum Apicomplexa) differentiates into an encysted form (bradyzoite) that can repeatedly re-emerge as a life-threatening acute infection (tachyzoite) upon impairment of immunity. Since the switch from tachyzoite to bradyzoite is a stress-induced response, we sought to identify components related to the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor-2), a well-characterized event associated with stress remediation in other eukaryotic systems. In addition to characterizing Toxoplasma eIF2alpha (TgIF2alpha), we have discovered a novel eIF2 ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7019-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7019_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 17:00:03">http://www.citeulike.org/user/hplatero/article/2148860</link><title>Identification of positive-acting domains in GCN2 protein kinase required for translational activation of GCN4 expression.</title><description>GCN4 is a transcriptional activator of amino acid-biosynthetic genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. GCN2, a translational activator of GCN4 expression, contains a domain homologous to the catalytic subunit of eucaryotic protein kinases. Substitution of a highly conserved lysine residue in the kinase domain abolished GCN2 regulatory function in vivo and its ability to autophosphorylate in vitro, indicating that GCN2 acts as a protein kinase in stimulating GCN4 expression. Elevated GCN2 gene dosage led to derepression of GCN4 under nonstarvation conditions; ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7019-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7019_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 17:01:25">http://www.citeulike.org/user/imouthesmp/article/572329</link><title>Coping with stress: eIF2 kinases and translational control.</title><description>In response to environmental stresses, a family of protein kinases phosphorylate eIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2) to alleviate cellular injury or alternatively induce apoptosis. Phosphorylation of eIF2 reduces global translation, allowing cells to conserve resources and to initiate a reconfiguration of gene expression to effectively manage stress conditions. Accompanying this general protein synthesis control, eIF2 phosphorylation induces translation of specific mRNAs, such as that encoding the bZIP (basic leucine zipper) transcriptional regulator ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4). ATF4 also enhances the ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
