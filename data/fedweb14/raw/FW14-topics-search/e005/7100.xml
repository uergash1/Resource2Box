Based on petrography, mineralogy, bulk rock chemistry and Sr-Nd isotopic characteristics, SFVF xenoliths can be divided into two major groups: cumulates and granulites. The cumulates are genetically related to the Cenozoic volcanic rocks and represent under- and/or intraplated additions to the crust of the Colorado Plateau. Assemblages are mafic to ultramafic and are dominated by clinopyroxene-orthopyroxene-plagioclase-spinel-amphibole-olivine. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7100-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7100_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:00:11">http://www.citeulike.org/user/sierradyer1/article/6102975</link><title>The Million Dollar Backfield: The San Francisco 49ers in the 1950s</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7100-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7100_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:01:30">http://www.citeulike.org/user/misonneh/article/12089722</link><title>Changing patterns in the clinical characteristics of korean breast cancer from 1996-2010 using an online nationwide breast cancer database.</title><description>Breast cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in Korean women, and its incidence is increasing at a rapid rate.

In one low-income inner-city district, the Tenderloin, residents organized and fought successful battles against the gentrifying growth regime through the 1980s. Moving beyond being a reactionary antigrowth movement, Tenderloin activists have advanced a proactive, neighborhood-sensitive regime, with a social-production capacity of its own, represented by the neighborhood's nonprofit housing movement. Their example teaches about the neighborhood-responsive progressive forces that ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7100-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7100_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 05:04:59">http://www.citeulike.org/user/amoore88/article/505266</link><title>Views from Inside: Memoirs concerning the Yugoslav Breakup and War</title><description>Recent memoirs published in Zagreb, Ljubljana, Sarajevo, and Podgorica offer glimpses into how the principals would like their roles in the events connected with the Yugoslav breakup and war to be remembered.

Using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction and a direct sequencing analysis, the frequencies of GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms were evaluated in 1,051 Korean male subjects. We found that 53.8% of the individuals had the GSTM1 null genotype and 54.3% had the GSTT 1 null genotype. The genotypic distribution of GSTP1 was Ile105/Ile105 in 68.4%, Ile105/Val105 in 29.1% and Val105/Va105 ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
