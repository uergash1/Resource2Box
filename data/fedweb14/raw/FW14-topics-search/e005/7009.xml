The goal of this partnership is to transform the U.S. health care sector from an underperforming conglomerate of independent entities (individual practitioners, small group practices, clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, community health centers et. al.) into a high performance "system" in which every participating unit recognizes its dependence and influence on every other unit. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7009-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7009_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-17 23:39:31">http://www.citeulike.org/user/asilva/article/1445788</link><title>Supporting and monitoring the creativity of IS personnel during the requirements engineering process</title><description>The early stages of the RE process involve developing understanding of a problem situation, the problem domain, and the requirements for achieving improvements in the problem situation. How requirements engineers work to develop this understanding is poorly understood. The findings from several field studies of the RE process show that the process is creative and opportunistic, involving adaptive and responsive exploration of the problem space. The question of how to support and monitor the... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7009-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7009_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-17 23:41:06">http://www.citeulike.org/user/sclaussen/article/4490930</link><title>Bringing real-world relevance into engineering classrooms</title><description>The IEEE's Women in Engineering (WIE) Committee and Educational Activities Board (EAB) are teaming up to provide universities with hands-on projects designed to encourage women to pursue degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. The IEEE initiative aims to change the way engineering is taught by introducing practical projects in freshman classes. It calls on the IEEE to work with educators to develop hands-on projects and online workshops for freshmen. The initiative also calls for developing online workshops that showcase the ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7009-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7009_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-17 23:42:02">http://www.citeulike.org/user/lorao/article/5032701</link><title>Toward the ideal mechanical engineering design support system</title><description>This paper details the progress toward the development of the ideal mechanical engineering design support system. It attempts to look at the gap between the needs of a mechanical engineer and what is currently available on CAD systems. Since the term CAD emphasizes that the computer is an aid to the human designer, this paper is designer-centric. It is based heavily on the activities performed by designers and the types of information developed by them. Seventeen goals for the ideal mechanical ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7009-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7009_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-17 23:44:09">http://www.citeulike.org/user/fujiyoshi-masaaki/article/6285805</link><title>A comparison of security requirements engineering methods</title><description>This paper presents a conceptual framework for security engineering, with a strong focus on security requirements elicitation and analysis. This conceptual framework establishes a clear-cut vocabulary and makes explicit the interrelations between the different concepts and notions used in security engineering. Further, we apply our conceptual framework to compare and evaluate current security requirements engineering approaches, such as the Common Criteria, Secure Tropos, SREP, MSRA, as well as methods based on UML and problem frames. We review these methods and assess ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7009-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7009_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-17 23:45:23">http://www.citeulike.org/user/melisCites/article/1398347</link><title>Collaboration in Software Engineering: A Roadmap</title><description>Software engineering projects are inherently cooperative, requiring many software engineers to coordinate their efforts to produce a large software system. Integral to this effort is developing shared understanding surrounding multiple artifacts, each artifact embodying its own model, over the entire development process. This focus on modeloriented collaboration embedded within a larger process is what distinguishes collaboration research in software engineering from broader collaboration research, which tends to address artifact-neutral coordination technologies and toolkits. This article first presents a list of goals ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7009-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7009_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-17 23:46:41">http://www.citeulike.org/group/1104/article/1300881</link><title>About Engineering Complex Systems: Multiscale Analysis and Evolutionary Engineering</title><description>We describe an analytic approach, multiscale analysis, that can demonstrate the fundamental limitations of decomposition based engineering for the development of highly complex systems. The planning based process is limited by the interdependence of components and communication between design teams. Thus, the construction of many highly complex systems should be pursued by strategies modeled after biological evolution, or market economies, where extensive planning is forsaken and multiple parallel design efforts compete for adoption through testing in actual use. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7009-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7009_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-17 23:47:40">http://www.citeulike.org/user/trickyDick/article/2902528</link><title>SPI - A Role for Method Engineering</title><description>This paper covers both the theory of situational method engineering and its application in terms of two industry case studies carried out over the last 5 years in Sydney, Australia in helping organizations to create agile and flexible methodologies, capable of maturing and improving over the years ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7009-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7009_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-17 23:48:46">http://www.citeulike.org/user/gridinoc/article/899583</link><title>Towards a Canonical and Structured Representation of PDF Documents</title><description>This article presents Xed, a reverse engineering tool for PDF documents, which extracts the original document layout structure. Xed mixes electronic extraction methods with state-of-the-art document analysis techniques and outputs the layout structure in a hierarchical canonical form, i.e. which is universal and independent of the document type. This article first reviews the major traps and tricks of the PDF format. It then introduces the architecture of Xed along with its main modules, and,... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7009-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7009_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-17 23:49:33">http://www.citeulike.org/user/I_Biomed/article/2251516</link><title>Time Frequency and Wavelets in Biomedical Signal Processing (IEEE Press Series on Biomedical Engineering)</title><description>Brimming with top articles from experts in signal processing and biomedical engineering, &lt;i&gt;Time Frequency and Wavelets in Biomedical Signal Processing&lt;/i&gt; introduces time-frequency, time-scale, wavelet transform methods, and their applications in biomedical signal processing.
