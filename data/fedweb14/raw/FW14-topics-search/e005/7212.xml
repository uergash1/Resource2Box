They have high affinity for Ca2+ and can efficiently regulate it down to very low concentration levels. Two of the pumps have been known for decades (the SERCA and PMCA pumps); one (the SPCA pump) has only become known recently. Each pump is the product of a multigene family, the number of isoforms being further increased ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7212-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7212_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:27:17">http://www.citeulike.org/article/10187530</link><title>Pumps and process energy optimization</title><description>Pumps represent a significant target for energy savings. The need to measure, monitor and manage consumption is viewed as an integral part of all process systems. Here, we demonstrate that a process energy optimization approach can allow energy consumption to be analysed and managed, giving potential efficiency gains of up to 30%. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7212-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7212_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:29:40">http://www.citeulike.org/article/11429808</link><title>Problem pumps: a thing of the past</title><description>Widely accepted statistics point to around 7% of a plant's process pumps consuming c. 60% of the maintenance funds allocated to its entire pump population.

Based on ethnographic research on a community of users of a MUD, or 'multi-user dimension', the book describes a close-knit community united in features of their language use, shared history, and relationships to other online communities. The author invokes the notion of register, or the variety of speech adapted to the communication situation, in her discussion of how users overcome the limitations of the typed, text ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7212-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7212_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:33:34">http://www.citeulike.org/user/EvaKaltenborn/article/2256685</link><title>Antibiotic efflux pumps</title><description>Active efflux from procaryotic as well as eucaryotic cells strongly modulates the activity of a large number of antibiotics. Effective antibiotic transport has now been observed for many classes of drug efflux pumps. Thus, within the group of primary active transporters, predominant in eucaryotes, six families belonging to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily, and including the P-glycoprotein in the MDR (Multi Drug Resistance) group and the MRP (Multidrug Resistance Protein), have been recognized as being responsible for antibiotic efflux. Within the class ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7212-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7212_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:33:57">http://www.citeulike.org/user/EvaKaltenborn/article/2030286</link><title>The structure and function of drug pumps</title><description>Resistance to drugs has emerged in biological systems as diverse as cancer cells undergoing chemotherapy and microbial pathogens undergoing treatment with antimicrobials. This medical problem is escalating and there is an urgent need for the development of new classes of drugs. In the case of pathogenic bacteria, we are rapidly approaching a scenario where there will be no effective antibiotics in the armoury of drugs available for treating the infectious diseases that these bacteria cause, returning us to the pre-antibiotic era ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7212-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7212_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:36:48">http://www.citeulike.org/user/mbiophys/article/5398093</link><title>In ethidium bromide does not induce its own degradation or the assembly of pumps involved in its efflux</title><description>Xu et al. [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 305 (2003) 941] reported that, when a mutant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lacking its major multidrug efflux pump complex, MexAB–OprM, was incubated with 100 μM ethidium bromide, the fluorescence, caused by its binding to DNA following its entry into cells, decreased gradually. The authors concluded that the intracellular ethidium bromide “induced” either its degradation or its efflux through the assembly of unknown efflux pumps. We found, through quantitation of ethidium bromide by absorption ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7212-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7212_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 19:37:52">http://www.citeulike.org/user/skato_toyaku/article/11737586</link><title>Metabolic stratification driven by surface and subsurface interactions in a terrestrial mud volcano</title><description>Terrestrial mud volcanism represents the prominent surface geological feature, where fluids and hydrocarbons are discharged along deeply rooted structures in tectonically active regimes. Terrestrial mud volcanoes (MVs) directly emit the major gas phase, methane, into the atmosphere, making them important sources of greenhouse gases over geological time. Quantification of methane emission would require detailed insights into the capacity and efficiency of microbial metabolisms either consuming or producing methane in the subsurface, and establishment of the linkage between these methane-related metabolisms and ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
