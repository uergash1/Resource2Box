Never has the old line about those who fail to understand the past being condemned to repeat it seemed more urgently relevant than in Iraq today, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the Iraqi people, the Middle East region, and the world.

Information cartographers Martin Dodge and Rob Kitchin show off a wide range of possibilities of representing the vast realms of data existing on and supporting the Internet. Since so many of these models were created to display never-before-charted territories, the book is largely devoted to analysing their accuracy, ease of development and use, potential for abuse, and other qualities. Chapters cover infrastructural elements, the Web, communities and creative renderings of cyberspace and contain ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7161-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7161_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:39:14">http://www.citeulike.org/article/8331416</link><title>The ideological roots of failure: the application of kinetic neo-liberalism to Iraq</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7161-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7161_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:39:27">http://www.citeulike.org/article/3996722</link><title>Community intervention and public policy in the prevention of antisocial behavior</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7161-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7161_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:39:39">http://www.citeulike.org/user/JoelJacobsen/article/5220026</link><title>Mechanisms of Gene-Environment Interaction Effects in the Development of Conduct Disorder.</title><description>The gene-environment interaction effect in the development of conduct disorder is one of the most important discoveries of the past decade, but the mechanisms through which this effect operates remain elusive. I propose a model of these processes that focuses on the individual's response to a threatening stimulus in ongoing social interaction. The individual's response coordinates three interrelated systems: neural, autonomic, and information-processing. In each system, adaptive, evolutionarily selected response patterns characterize normal responding, but in psychopathology these patterns have gone ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
