Thoroughly updated and revised, this book continues to be essential for any researcher or student needing to learn to speak, read, and write about discriminant analysis as well as develop a philosophy of empirical research and data analysis. Its thorough introduction to the application of discriminant analysis is unparalleled. Offering the most up-to-date computer applications, references, ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7099-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7099_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:46:39">http://www.citeulike.org/user/guhjy/article/12738627</link><title>Beyond step-down analysis: a new test for decomposing the importance of dependent variables in MANOVA.</title><description>Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is often categorized as a tool for experimental psychologists. However, it also continues to be a popular statistical procedure used by organizational scientists. Unfortunately, when the dependent variables (DV) are correlated with one another, interpreting the significant omnibus test in MANOVA becomes difficult. The present article proposes a novel way of interpreting a significant MANOVA that draws from work dedicated ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7099-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7099_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:47:45">http://www.citeulike.org/user/guhjy/article/9110824</link><title>Analysis of longitudinal data. Beyond MANOVA.</title><description>Routine use of MANOVA for the analysis of longitudinal data, particularly when there is a substantial proportion of drop-outs, is ill advised. Statisticians have considerably enriched the available methodologies during the past decade, and psychiatric researchers dealing with such data should be aware of the advantages of the newer methods. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7099-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7099_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:48:51">http://www.citeulike.org/user/chrys/article/2477898</link><title>Robustified MANOVA with applications in detecting differentially expressed genes from oligonucleotide arrays.</title><description>MOTIVATION: Oligonucleotide arrays such as Affymetrix GeneChips use multiple probes, or a probe set, to measure the abundance of mRNA of every gene of interest. Some analysis methods attempt to summarize the multiple observations into one single score before conducting further analysis such as detecting differentially expressed genes (DEG), clustering and classification. However, there is a risk of losing a significant amount of information and consequently reaching inaccurate or even incorrect conclusions during this data reduction. RESULTS: We developed a novel ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7099-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7099_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:50:02">http://www.citeulike.org/article/403862</link><title>Advanced Algorithms 28 November 2001</title><description>rder to determine the cut S V . As discussed in the last lecture, we can do this with a hyperplane in R , and split the vectors based on which side of the hyperplane they fall. However, since we can rotate all of the vectors v i without changing the goodness of the solution, it is not a good idea to x a single hyperplane to do this separation since some cases will elicit a poor split. Instead, we select a unit vector r uniformly at ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7099-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7099_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:51:20">http://www.citeulike.org/user/hgunji/article/3113541</link><title>Credit constraints, equity market liberalizations and international trade</title><description>This paper provides evidence that credit constraints are an important determinant of international trade flows. I exploit shocks to the availability of external finance and examine the impact of equity market liberalizations on the export behavior of 91 countries in the 1980-1997 period. I show that liberalizations increase exports disproportionately more in financially vulnerable sectors that require more outside finance or employ fewer collateralizable assets. This result is not driven by cross-country differences in factor endowments and is independent of simultaneous ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7099-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7099_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:52:25">http://www.citeulike.org/article/7068324</link><title>Suffix combinations in Bulgarian: parsability and hierarchy-based ordering</title><description>Abstract  This article extends the empirical scope of the most recent approach to affix ordering, the Parsability Hypothesis (Hay 2001, 2002, 2003) or Complexity-Based Ordering (CBO) (Plag 2002; Hay and Plag 2004; Plag and Baayen 2009), to the inflecting-fusional morphological type, as represented by the South Slavic language Bulgarian. In order to account properly for the structure of the Bulgarian word, I distinguish between suffixes that are in the derivational word slot and suffixes that are in the inflectional word slot and ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7099-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7099_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:53:27">http://www.citeulike.org/user/alinarello/article/12272440</link><title>Credit Constraints, Heterogeneous Firms, and International Trade</title><description>Financial market imperfections severely restrict international trade flows because exporters require external capital. This article identifies and quantifies the three mechanisms through which credit constraints affect trade: the selection of heterogeneous firms into domestic production, the selection of domestic manufacturers into exporting, and the level of firm exports. I incorporate financial frictions into a heterogeneous-firm model and apply it to aggregate trade data for a large panel of countries. I establish causality by exploiting the variation in financial development across countries ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7099-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7099_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:54:35">http://www.citeulike.org/user/gareth/article/2644894</link><title>How the power of MANOVA can both increase and decrease as a function of the intercorrelations among the dependent variables</title><description>This article directly addresses explicit contradictions in the literature regarding the relation between the power of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and the intercorrelations among the dependent variables. Artificial data sets, as well as analytical methods, revealed that (a) power increases as correlations between dependent variables with large consistent effect sizes (that are in the same direction) move from near 1.0 toward -1.0, (b) power increases as correlations become more positive or more negative between dependent variables that have very different ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7099-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7099_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 04:55:47">http://www.citeulike.org/user/gareth/article/2646068</link><title>Power analysis for multivariate and repeated measures designs: a flexible approach using the SPSS MANOVA procedure.</title><description>Although power analysis is an important component in the planning and implementation of research designs, it is often ignored. Computer programs for performing power analysis are available, but most have limitations, particularly for complex multivariate designs. An SPSS procedure is presented that can be used for calculating power for univariate, multivariate, and repeated measures models with and without time-varying and time-constant covariates. Three examples provide a framework for calculating power via this method: an ANCOVA, a MANOVA, and a repeated measures ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
