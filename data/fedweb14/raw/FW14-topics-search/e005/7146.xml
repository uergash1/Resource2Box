We use a geographic information system (GIS) to describe the pattern of emergency department reported falls of the elderly in the Capital Health Region, an administrative health area in Alberta, Canada. We used empirical Bayes estimates to obtain a geographic measure of fall incidence over the study area and a cluster detection statistic to measure the presence of a significant spatial ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7146-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7146_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:55:08">http://www.citeulike.org/user/derchao/article/7329172</link><title>From the Editors Why Aren't Business Schools More Global and What Can Management Educators Do About It?</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7146-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7146_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:55:50">http://www.citeulike.org/user/personx/article/1924694</link><title>A Delay Tolerant Network Architecture for Challenged Internets</title><description>The highly successful architecture and protocols of today's Internet may operate poorly in environments characterized by very long delay paths and frequent network partitions. These problems are exacerbated by end nodes with limited power or memory resources. Often deployed in mobile and extreme environments lacking continuous connectivity, many such networks have their own specialized protocols, and do not utilize IP. To achieve interoperability between them, we propose a network architecture... ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7146-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7146_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 21:57:17">http://www.citeulike.org/article/106719</link><title>A Delay Tolerant Network Architecture for Challenged Internets</title><description>The highly successful architecture and protocols of today's Internet may operate poorly in environments characterized by very long delay paths and frequent network partitions.

A sample of 112 male participants underwent a computer-based task three times in three weeks. Our results indicate that significant results for self-enhancement and hemodynamic cardiovascular reactivity found using raw cardiovascular data were non-significant when HP-CD model was ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7146-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7146_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 22:07:04">http://www.citeulike.org/user/derchao/article/4688825</link><title>Why learning from failure isn’t easy (and what to do about it): Innovation trauma at Sun Microsystems☆</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7146-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7146_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 22:09:27">http://www.citeulike.org/article/7406933</link><title>The impact of task controllability on perceived control and cardiovascular processes</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7146-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7146_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-19 22:12:54">http://www.citeulike.org/user/derchao/article/5802778</link><title>Why do top management teams look the way they do? A multilevel exploration of the antecedents of TMT heterogeneity</title><description>While individual-level social psychological processes may promote top management team (TMT) homogeneity, a number of organizational and environmental factors pose requirements for increasing TMT heterogeneity. These opposing mechanisms lead to different predictions regarding the outcome of the TMT selection process. This article investigates the interactions between the different level factors influencing TMT heterogeneity in order to determine under what conditions pressures towards heterogeneity prevail over the tendency towards homosocial reproduction. Based on a panel dataset of 165 Swiss listed companies, the ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
