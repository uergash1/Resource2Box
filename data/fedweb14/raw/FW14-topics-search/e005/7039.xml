Over the course of the past decade, the Excel program has undergone a series of revisions that make the Carr and Burkholder paper somewhat difficult to follow with newer versions. The present article provides task analyses for constructing various types of commonly used single-subject design graphs in Microsoft Excel 2007. The task analyses were evaluated using a ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7039-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7039_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 19:44:22">http://www.citeulike.org/user/heathervincent/article/339459</link><title>Mistaken Identifiers: Gene name errors can be introduced inadvertently when using Excel in bioinformatics</title><description>BACKGROUND:When processing microarray data sets, we recently noticed that some gene names were being changed inadvertently to non-gene names.RESULTS:A little detective work traced the problem to default date format conversions and floating-point format conversions in the very useful Excel program package. The date conversions affect at least 30 gene names; the floating-point conversions affect at least 2,000 if Riken identifiers are included. These conversions are irreversible; the original gene names cannot be recovered.CONCLUSIONS:Users of Excel for analyses involving gene names should ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7039-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7039_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 19:45:30">http://www.citeulike.org/user/stevekuan/article/392833</link><title>Excel Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips and Tools</title><description>The spreadsheet is the software tool that turns everyone into a hacker by making it possible to play with numbers easily. &lt;I&gt;Excel Hacks&lt;/I&gt;, therefore, makes a lot of sense. This small, fact-dense book explains how to get maximum utility from Microsoft's popular calculation application. It shows how to use all the stuff you know is in there but have never bothered to figure out (dynamic cell ranges, PivotTables, macros), and how to carry out particularly hasslesome calculations (notably those involving dates). ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7039-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7039_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 19:46:31">http://www.citeulike.org/user/guhjy/article/10311554</link><title>LICSS - a chemical spreadsheet in microsoft excel.</title><description>Representations of chemical datasets in spreadsheet format are important for ready data assimilation and manipulation. In addition to the normal spreadsheet facilities, chemical spreadsheets need to have visualisable chemical structures and data searchable by chemical as well as textual queries. Many such chemical spreadsheet tools are available, some operating in the familiar Microsoft Excel environment. However, within this group, the performance of Excel is often ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7039-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7039_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-18 19:47:33">http://www.citeulike.org/user/guhjy/article/9218098</link><title>SCEW: a Microsoft Excel add-in for easy creation of survival curves.</title><description>Survival curves are frequently used for reporting survival or mortality outcomes of experimental pharmacological/toxicological studies and of clinical trials. Microsoft Excel is a simple and widely used tool for creation of numerous types of graphic presentations however it is difficult to create step-wise survival curves in Excel.

CFA is often seen as an impenetrable technique, and thus, when it is taught, there is frequently little explanation of the mechanisms or underlying calculations. The aim of this article is to demonstrate that this is not the case; it is relatively straightforward to produce a spreadsheet in MS Excel that can carry out simple CFA. It is possible, with few or no programming skills, to ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
