The existing theories are not quantifiable and efforts need to be made to quantify the models and incorporate neuropsychological findings in humor research. We propose a new computational model (GraPHIA) for perceiving phonological jokes or puns. GraPHIA consists of a semantic network and a phonological network where words are represented by nodes in both the networks. Novel features based on graph theoretical concepts are proposed and computed ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7401-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7401_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 19:43:47">http://www.citeulike.org/article/44401</link><title>Demythologising Gender in Development: Feminist Studies in African Contexts</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7401-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7401_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 19:44:56">http://www.citeulike.org/user/Zyanya/article/2923918</link><title>Zoledronic acid significantly reduces skeletal complications compared with placebo in Japanese women with bone metastases from breast cancer: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.</title><description>To investigate the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid for the treatment of bone metastases from breast cancer. Women with bone metastases (N = 228) were randomly assigned to receive 4 mg zoledronic acid (n = 114) or placebo (n = 114) via 15-minute infusions every 4 weeks for 1 year. The primary efficacy end point was the skeletal-related event (SRE) rate ratio between treatment groups. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7401-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7401_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 19:45:35">http://www.citeulike.org/user/jennybargelski/article/987741</link><title>Graeme Ritchie, The Linguistic Analysis of Jokes</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7401-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7401_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 19:46:39">http://www.citeulike.org/user/phillipkent/article/11896481</link><title>Math Jokes 4 Mathy Folks</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7401-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7401_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 19:47:41">http://www.citeulike.org/user/Laurentjp/article/5981184</link><title>The functional anatomy of humor: segregating cognitive and affective components</title><description>Humor, a unique human characteristic, is critical in thought, communication and social interaction. Successful jokes involve a cognitive juxtaposition of mental sets, followed by an affective feeling of amusement; we isolated these two components of humor by using event-related fMRI on subjects who listened to auditorily presented semantic and phonological jokes (puns) and indicated whether or not they found the items amusing. Our findings suggest that whereas there are modality-specific pathways for processing the juxtaposition of mental sets necessary for the ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7401-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7401_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 19:48:30">http://www.citeulike.org/article/89085</link><title>Hair color changes caused by dyeing and thermal treatments</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7401-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7401_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 19:50:28">http://www.citeulike.org/article/6174718</link><title>Plasma concentrations, behavioural and physiological effects following intravenous and intramuscular detomidine in horses</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7401-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7401_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 19:52:12">http://www.citeulike.org/article/3658222</link><title>Comparison of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and Radioimmunoassay for Measurement of Fentanyl and Determination of Pharmacokinetics in Equine Plasma</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7401-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7401_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 19:54:16">http://www.citeulike.org/article/12029135</link><title>A Review of Aspects of Oxidative Hair Dye Chemistry with Special Reference to N-Nitrosamine Formation</title><description>This review discusses a new aspect to the safety profile of oxidative hair dyes using data already in the public domain. These dyes contain secondary amines that are capable of forming potentially carcinogenic nitrosamine derivatives when exposed to atmospheric pollution. Numerous scientific articles confirm the existence of secondary amines in hair dyes (and their intermediates), the possibility of nitrosation by atmospheric NOx of secondary amines to give the N-nitrosamines, and the significant safety risks on N-nitrosamines. It is believed that ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
