Therefore, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to provide a reliable answer as to whether acetylcysteine is effective in decreasing the risk of CIN in high-risk patients undergoing angiographic procedures. Methods: ACT is a RCT of acetylcysteine versus placebo in 2,300 patients at-risk for CIN undergoing an intravascular angiographic procedure.

We argue that a new political regime compares the benefit of reshaping the judiciary with loyal appointees against the political and economic costs of directly interfering, including the cost of international reputation. There are several forms of interventionism including court packing, court purging, and violence against the judiciary. We discuss political transitions in Europe and Latin American civil law jurisdictions through the lens of our theory. We ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7189-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7189_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 12:48:39">http://www.citeulike.org/user/kokarev/article/7750871</link><title>Judiciary and the Dilemmas of Violence</title><description>In observing the many legal assistance projects around the world, one cannot help but be struck by the dilemma of violence and the Rule of Law. No justice system can operate effectively in the midst of chaos but chaos cannot be forestalled effectively without a functioning justice system. Consider three places in which the United States and a number of European nations have taken an active military role while trying to assist nascent or renascent judicial systems: Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7189-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7189_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 12:49:22">http://www.citeulike.org/user/kapa123/article/9169252</link><title>What Works in Student Retention?
