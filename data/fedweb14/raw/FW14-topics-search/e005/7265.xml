The carbon stocks were estimated to a 30 cm depth based on datasets containing information on vegetation, wetlands, soils and land classifications. The total grassland area (including natural grasslands, semi-natural grasslands, meadows/pastures and artificial grasslands ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7265-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7265_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 10:29:37">http://www.citeulike.org/user/waweruk2001/article/12160038</link><title>Withania somnifera : the Indian ginseng ashwagandha</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7265-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7265_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 10:32:54">http://www.citeulike.org/user/MHRashid/article/7465422</link><title>Stems and Root Systems just after the First Overwintering of Kudzu (Pueraria lobata OHWI) Stands Differing in Spacing</title><description>Stem length per unit area, the number of rooted nodes per unit area, and the magnitude of root systems etc. were compared among kudzu stands differing in spacing (40,80 and 120cm spacings) just after overwintering (March 1-10). Forty-nine to 60 one-square meter quadrats were placed in the kudzu stands and then stems, crowns and rooted nodes were sampled within each quadrat. Despite greater living stem length per unit area in 120cm spacing than in 40cm spacing, the number of rooted nodes ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7265-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7265_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 10:36:29">http://www.citeulike.org/user/simlab/article/1122151</link><title>Grassland degradation in China: Methods of monitoring, management and restoration</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7265-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7265_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 10:39:44">http://www.citeulike.org/user/maniruzzaman/article/10424439</link><title>Mineral cost of carnivory in aquatic carnivorous plants</title><description>Tissue N, P, K, Ca, and Mg content was estimated in traps and photosynthetic and carnivorous shoots in five aquatic carnivorous plant species from an outdoor culture: Aldrovanda vesiculosa, Utricularia vulgaris, U. reflexa, U. intermedia, and U. stygia, for the determination of the mineral cost of carnivory. In three species with monomorphic shoots (A. vesiculosa, U. vulgaris, U. reflexa), tissue P and K content in traps was significantly higher than that in their photosynthetic shoots, whereas N content was about the ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7265-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7265_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 10:41:34">http://www.citeulike.org/user/ipora/article/2432056</link><title>The grassland farming system and sustainable agricultural development in China</title><description>Abstract Grassland is the largest terrestrial ecosystem in China, at about 39 280 x 104 ha and covers 41% of the total land area. Grasslands not only provide forage to feed livestock, but also play a critical role in alleviating many of the most challenging environmental and ecological problems that humankind is facing. About 90% of the total usable grassland in China has been degraded to various extents and this is the number one problem facing agricultural production, rural development and ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7265-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7265_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 10:45:10">http://www.citeulike.org/user/Ale90/article/10667286</link><title>Transcriptional regulations of the genes of starch metabolism and physiological changes in response to salt stress rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings</title><description>The aim of this investigation was to compare the transcriptional expression of starch metabolism, involving genes and physiological characters, in seedlings of two contrasting salt-tolerant rice genotypes, in response to salt-stress. The soluble sugar content in rice seedlings of both salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive genotypes was enriched, relating to starch degradation, in plants subjected to 200 mM NaCl. In the salt-tolerant cultivar Pokkali, a major source of carbon may be that derived from the photosynthetic system and starch degradation. In starch degradation, only ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7265-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7265_08.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 10:49:15">http://www.citeulike.org/user/AndersMir/article/8629199</link><title>A comparative study of seed number, seed size, seedling size and recruitment in grassland plants</title><description>In this study we analyse relationships between seed number, seed size, seedling size and recruitment success in grassland plants. The often hypothesised trade-off between seed size and seed number was supported by a cross-species analysis and by an analysis of 35 phylogenetically independent contrasts, derived from a data-set of 72 species. Apart from among-species relatedness, we also controlled for possible confounding effect of plant size that may influence both seed size and seed number. A sowing experiment with 50 species was ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7265-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7265_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 10:49:53">http://www.citeulike.org/user/pollinator/article/9583970</link><title>The contribution of roadside grassland restorations to native bee conservation</title><description>Marginal habitats such as hedgerows or roadsides become especially important for the conservation of biodiversity in highly modified landscapes. With concerns of a global pollination crisis, there is a need for improving pollinator habitat. Roadsides restored to native prairie vegetation may provide valuable habitat to bees, the most important group of pollinators. Such roadsides support a variety of pollen and nectar sources and unlike agricultural fields, are unplowed, and therefore can provide potential nesting sites for ground-nesting bees. To examine potential ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7265-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7265_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 10:52:34">http://www.citeulike.org/user/MHRashid/article/7465419</link><title>Dry Matter Production and Leaf Area Expansion of the Current Year's Canopy in a Natural Kudzu (Pueraria lobata OHWI) Stand, Established in a Field Left Abandoned for about 15 Years</title><description>Current year's stems and overwintering stems of kudzu-vine, other plant species and litter were sampled separately, using 1-m^2 quadrats, in a kudzu stand which was established in an abandoned field about 15 years previously. Current year's stem emergence from the buds on overwintering stems, and current year's stem dry matter and leaf area production were examined to compare with results obtained previously by the present authors and another researcher (Athens, Georgia, USA). In the one-ring stems, the number of living current ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
