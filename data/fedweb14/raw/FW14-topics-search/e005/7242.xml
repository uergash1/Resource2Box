Both the Choice of Court Convention and the Brussels I Regulation share a common goal. However, some differences surface when the operational systems of the two instruments and their respective scopes of application are compared. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7242-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7242_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 03:25:43">http://www.citeulike.org/article/6406441</link><title>On the B-canonical splittings of flag varieties</title><description>Let G be a semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. In this note, we show that an irreducible closed subvariety of the flag variety of G is compatibly split by the unique canonical Frobenius splitting if and only if it is a Richardson variety, i.e. an intersection of a Schubert and an opposite Schubert variety. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7242-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7242_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 03:29:49">http://www.citeulike.org/article/9385398</link><title>Before Abduction: The Contactee Narrative of the 1950s</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7242-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7242_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 03:31:43">http://www.citeulike.org/article/9477675</link><title>Does the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption Adequately Protect Orphaned and Vulnerable Children and Their Families?</title><description>The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, designed to protect the best interests of the child in intercountry adoption, has been signed by 83 nations. We evaluate both the strengths and the weaknesses of the Convention in achieving this purpose and also in protecting a second vulnerable population, birth families. A case study example of the United States’ implementation of the Hague requirements reveals several weaknesses with respect to non-Convention countries as sending nations, financial oversight, and oversight of foreign collaborators.

In coordination problems, the interests of the agents coincide, while in partial conflict problems, some agents stand to gain only if other agents unilaterally make certain sacrifices. Lewis' (1969) pathbreaking analysis of convention in terms of game theory focuses on coordination problems, and cannot accommodate partial conflict problems. In this paper, I propose a new game-theoretic definition of convention which generalizes previous game-theoretic definitions (Lewis ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7242-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7242_09.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 03:39:31">http://www.citeulike.org/user/uvriss/article/3633976</link><title>Common Knowledge and Convention</title><description>This paper investigates the epistemic assumptions that David Lewis makes in his account of social conventions. In particular, I focus on the assumption that the agents have common knowledge of the convention to which they are parties. While evolutionary analyses show that the common knowledge assumption is unnecessary in certain classes of games, Lewis’ original account (and, more recently, Cubitt and Sugden’s reconstruction) stresses the importance of including it in the definition of convention. I discuss arguments pro et contra to ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7242-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7242_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 03:42:33">http://www.citeulike.org/user/voiklis/article/1089894</link><title>Convention in joint activity</title><description>Conventional behaviors develop from practice for regularly occurring problems of coordination within a community of actors. Reusing and extending conventional methods for coordinating behavior is the task of everyday reasoning. The computational model presented in the paper details the emergence of convention in circumstances where there is no ruling body of knowledge developed by prior generations of actors within the community to guide behavior. The framework we assume combines social theories of cognition with human information processing models that have been ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
