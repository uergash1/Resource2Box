A swarm is a dynamic pattern of individuals in space. The structure of a musical composition is shaped in advance of the performance, but the organization of a swarm is emergent, without pre-planning. What use, therefore, might swarms have in music? ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7079-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7079_03.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:04:51">http://www.citeulike.org/user/vsct103/article/6564814</link><title>Navigating Digital Sheet Music on the Web: Challenges and Opportunities</title><description>Affordable digital sheet music readers, along with the recent proliferation of Web sites hosting digital sheet music, necessitate a more detailed discussion of these valuable resources with a focus on copyright and website functionality in addition to coverage and quality.

Similarly, more recent national education legislation like No Child Left Behind has recognized music as a core curricular subject. Since that time, little has been done to assess music students to ensure a set of basic skills and knowledge is being achieved. While national and state music standards exist, these standards, in many cases, are not mandatory and ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7079-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7079_06.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:05:58">http://www.citeulike.org/user/alonihill/article/6690548</link><title>The Canadian Music Journal : Special issue : Organs and organ playing in Canada.</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7079-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7079_07.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:06:28">http://www.citeulike.org/group/17327/article/4146365</link><title>Music Psychology and Music Theory: Problems and Prospects</title><description>Music theorists and music psychologists may benefit from increasing awareness of each others' discipline. However, it is necessary to delimit the common ground shared by the disciplines and, at the same time, to clarify basic differences between the two approaches. Toward this end, this article begins with a schematic history of the psychology of music from the point of view of how it has been influenced by music theory. Following this is a brief characterization of the goals, methods, and theoretical ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7079-08"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7079_08.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:06:44">http://www.citeulike.org/user/Yuhui_ch/article/4760099</link><title>Characteristics of Music Teachers and the Progress of Young Instrumentalists</title><description>This study is an investigation of the role of some key characteristics of teachers in the development of students' musical ability. Interviewing 257 children who differed in the extent of their instrumental mastery, we discovered that the most successful learners regarded their teachers differently from those children who ceased music study. The more successful learners rated their first teacher higher than did other learners on personal dimensions such as friendliness, and rated their current teacher higher than did other learners on ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7079-09"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7079_09.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:07:00">http://www.citeulike.org/user/albachteng/article/8197366</link><title>Madness in the Music Theatre Works of Peter Maxwell Davies</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7079-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7079_10.html" timestamp="2014-05-21 14:07:14">http://www.citeulike.org/user/Yuhui_ch/article/942358</link><title>The Functions of Music in Everyday Life: Redefining the Social in Music Psychology</title><description>What psychological functions does music serve in everyday life? In this paper we argue that the answer to this question is changing as a result of current social and technological changes in music itself, and that these changes force us to re-evaluate the role of the social context in music psychology. After describing the changes we go on to outline the psychological functions of music in everyday life in terms of the cognitive, emotional and social domains. We next attempt a ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
