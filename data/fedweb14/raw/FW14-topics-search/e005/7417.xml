Through the accumulation of tags and points in defined combinations, they earn achievement awards and gain the ability to create their own tags and achievements. Taking the metaphor of APIs from software development and drawing parallels between the way we model game state, Social Heroes attempts to provide a ludic interface for our personal relationships. The result is a system ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7417-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7417_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 22:52:43">http://www.citeulike.org/article/10500399</link><title>Third-order nonlinear optical response in transparent solids using ultrashort laser pulses</title><description>The third-order optical nonlinearity, χ (3) , is measured in transparent glasses (BK7 and fused silica) and crystals (BaF 2 and quartz) using 36-fs, 800-nm laser pulses and the optical Kerr gate (OKE) technique; values are found to lie in the range 1.3–1.7×10 -14 esu, in accordance with theoretical estimates. We probe the purely electronic response to the incident ultrashort laser pulse in fused silica and BK7 glass. In BaF 2 and quartz, apart from the electronic response we also observe ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7417-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7417_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 22:53:25">http://www.citeulike.org/user/wxflogic/article/9479087</link><title>Modal Foundations for Predicate Logic</title><description>The complexity of any logical modeling reflects both the intrinsic structure of a topic described and the weight of the formal tools. Some of this weight seems inherent in even the most basic logical systems. Notably, standard predicate logic is undecidable. In this paper, we investigate `lighter' versions of this general purpose tool, by modally `deconstructing' the usual semantics, and locating implicit choice points in its set up. The first part sets out the interest of this program and the modal ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7417-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7417_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 22:54:08">http://www.citeulike.org/article/3891475</link><title>PC-Based ECG Waveform RecognitionValidation of Novel Software Against a Reference ECG Database</title></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7417-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7417_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 22:56:06">http://www.citeulike.org/user/komada/article/7755749</link><title>Hadron physics with KLOE-2</title><description>In the upcoming month the KLOE-2 data taking campaign will start at the upgraded DAFNE phi-factory of INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati. The main goal is to collect an integrated luminosity of about 20 fb^(-1) in 3-4 years in order to refine and extend the KLOE program on both kaon physics and hadron spectroscopy. Here the expected improvements on the results of hadron spectroscopy are presented and briefly discussed. ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7417-06"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7417_06.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 22:57:31">http://www.citeulike.org/user/tmaillart/article/228749</link><title>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</title><description>Today, technology is cool. Owning the most powerful computer, the latest high-tech gadget, and the whizziest web site is a status symbol on a par with having a flashy car or a designer suit. And a media obsessed with the digital explosion has reappropriated the term "computer nerd" so that it's practically synonymous with "entrepreneur." Yet, a mere fifteen years ago, wireheads hooked on tweaking endless lines of code were seen as marginal weirdos, outsiders whose world would ...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e005-7417-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e005/7417_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-22 22:58:57">http://www.citeulike.org/article/11375593</link><title>44Sc-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH2 in comparison to 68Ga-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH2 in pre-clinical investigation. Is 44Sc a potential radionuclide for PET?</title><description>In the present study we demonstrate the in vitro and in vivo comparison of the 44Sc and 68Ga labeled DOTA-BN[2-14]NH2. 44Sc is a positron emitter with a half life of 3.92 h. Hence it could be used for PET imaging with ligands requiring longer observation time than in the case of 68Ga. The binding affinity of natSc-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH2 and natGa-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH2 to GRP receptors was studied in competition to [125I-Tyr4]-Bombesin in the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3.
