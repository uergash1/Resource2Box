This is a hot topic near and dear to my heart.

I create a site 4 years ago that I've been writing on every since... there are probably near 2000 articles on it. Everything from fixing your MTU settings on your Q1000 modem to Java framework tips I find handy to years worth of game and movies reviews to hilarious cat pictures.

It's just anything and everything I've ever found interesting written in a slightly more professional manner than "stream of thought" with a small amount of attention paid to titles and internal links only when appropriate and valuable (I HATE how sites like Engadget inner-link every keyword for Google sake).

My understanding was always that "If I wrote it, they will come".

4 years later and that's not the case at all... I seem to be hitting a goddamn glass ceiling that I cannot figure out for the life of me why it exists or who is imposing it and I want to scream.

This topic on Reddit recently: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d7e24/my_job_was_to_game_digg_using_infographics_voting/

Got my ire up... then combined with typical junk search results I see on Google in any given day for a legit topic I'm searching for and I'm coming to the conclusion that you just can't win online unless you are an SEO-douchebag.

When was the last time you searched for something technical and found a CNET link and headed over only to notice it's a landing page that says "We didn't review this BUT we reviewed..." and has 97 links to other things on the site?

What the fuck.

Is this the only way to succeed now with this content diarrhea mill that is the web?

In the last month I've been having a a major brain block on the design of my website.

I decided to take a step back from the coding and immerse myself in movies (Slumdog Millionaire is indeed Oscar worthy), books (Haruki Murakami rocks), music (can't beat Cat Sevens), and design (i've included a link to John Maeda's site).

After this creativity pilgrimage I feel refreshed and full of creative vigor.

Now, let's see if I can convert this energy into a profitable social networking site!

Have you watched the movie "Catwoman"? Halle Berry is starring. Halle Berry transform in a cat after her death. This is a magic, which will change dramatically her life. After that she began her attempt to stop a director of a famous company to start selling cream for face which is unhealthy and dangerous for women's life...
