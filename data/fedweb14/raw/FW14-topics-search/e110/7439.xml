My partner and I will be launching our startup in a week or two. We will subsequently be moving to San Jose, CA on June 8th to pursue our venture full time. We will be staying at a great 4 bedroom single home in a fantastic area.

Our startup is small, just the two of us. So that means we will have two rooms to spare, rather than renting the rooms to some total (useless) strangers i would rather have two (useful) hackers stay.

I came up with an interesting solution. Why not let hackers stay for free as long as they provided some contribution to the house and our project. It would make for great environment, an environment of education,networking and most of all, fun. So if you think you would be interested in staying in the "hacker house" submit a short application to us via our e-mail. Include your Name,background,projects/demos,and what you would add to the house.

We would like for the interested YCers to be from the east coast or Midwest, people that normally wouldn't have the opportunity to move to bay area. A younger crown is preferred, i'm 22 and my partner is 23. For many reason, men only. You don't have to be a hacker, but it's strong recommended.

Please understand that there will no compensation besides room and board and possibly a community car(i'm not sure yet, i have to check with insurance company).food?ramen?. You will be responsible for all travel expenses. We will also have a crash couch for any hackers that are passing through. We simply ask that the guest write a blog post on our blog about themselves/company. I'm sure i'm forgetting a lot of info, but i'll be setting up a simple dedicated site just for the house soon.

Feel free to subscribe to my twitter feed for more info.http://twitter.com/cbomb

I posted this about 12 hours ago[0], but it got very few upvotes, so I'm posting it again for the different audience.

In response to a question asked recently[1] I've re-implemented my scripts to retrieve my saved stories. The scripts are fragile and not pretty - I just hacked them together quickly to get the job done. The question has come up before, so if anyone wants them, let me know. If enough people ask then I'll stick them on GitHub or something and make them open.

My concern is that it is scripted access to HN, so it might be regarded as "unkind", and I'd be interested to now what the HN crown thinks.

Thoughts?

Totally do-able, but it's probably better to use such talk to leverage the current carriers. There biggest issue would be buying spectrum. There mere presence would drive up the value of new spectrums up for auction to obscene levels. Tower space is predominately run by ATC and Crown. Apple would more likely build out DAS networks in the major cities. More expensive, but a very scalable network to easily handle data consumption. They could also jump on existing neutral hosting DAS networks. They could put up a solid nationwide network in 10 years. The approach and thinking would have to be long term in terms of ROI. I am just playing with numbers on a spreadsheet, but if Apple did invest $100B in spectrum, network deployment and building a new company. Then with an ARPU of $100/month and 80M plus users, they might possibly make their money back in ten years. Wireless is a legit mature proven industry with talent and expertise in rapid deployments, marketing/sales and technology with each carrier having their own competitive advantages. If Apple can leverage their $ and exploit their own competive advantages(brand name &amp; technology) to tap into that good talent for a competive build out, then it's totally do-able.

QuoraQuora connects you to everything you want to know about. LoginSign UpAirbnb:

Has anyone had the experience of your Host listings being turned off by AirBnB due to bringing to their attention problems with their platform and procedures? John Cohen, NYC HostYes

AirBnB recently hid all my listings. At the same time they cancelled over 19 bookings adding up to over $7000 dollars most likely more. Here is a copy of the email sent to those inconvenienced persons.

Dear xxxx, We were just informed by John Cohen that your accommodation starting on xxx, April xx, 2012 (reservation xxxxxxx) is no longer available. You should know that hosts are penalized for canceling reservations and removed from our site if they do so frequently.

I am no longer able to access my account to see my future payouts -- approximately $2000 dollars -- or when I will recieve $954.

At the suggestion of an experienced attorney I have backed all information that was in my account including changes that were occurring after AirBnB shut off my listings.

I cannot prove what the customer service supervisor said over the phone but I will quote "We have discussed it among ourselves", "There are simply too many customer service requests from your account", "You can apply in two months to be re-instated."

After careful review of the backups it appears to be 21 bookings not 17. As of this date several guests are living in my home. Booked through airBnB. I have no idea if I will be paid for their stay. Here is a short list of my Complaints that resulted in AirBnb hiding my listings.

1) Peer review process as implemented is being used by a few guests as a threat of a "Bad review" if I do not bend to demands for services not offered. Or if I attempt to enforce the House rules such as under age drinking or cleanig up after themselves.( Threse guests have no reviews of their own.)

2) Security Hole. Apparently airBnB does not maintain any information of the Guest of the guest.

3) CSR who answer the phones are given extraordinary power to rush to a judgement without giving the Host the benefit of the doubt.

4) Reservvation panel is a Mess if you are a busy Host. Dificult to make heads or tales from this. Even the CSR.

5) Bad reviews which are not opinion but statements of Fact. Say about the cleanliness of a Host. "Place smells like Garbage" Bathroom's are dirty" by a guest who frequently broke house rules.

6) A clear and convincing connection between Guests who them selves have no reviews making a complaint or bad review on a Host who has asked them courteously to obey House rules.

7) Repeatedly blocking out up to 10 days or more on a room until an investigation is complete. Finding the Host acted properly

8) Many of my customer service calls were about parts of the WebSite not working or learning how to nagivate it properly. I have bad eye sight and need new glasses. EG recently a part of the listings page failed to show up where prominently it states Host has PETS. Two guests allergic to Cats appeared.

. Though my listing clearly states CATS. I had to have my House keeper Vacume 2,000 square feet. So that the guests could finish their bookings. My cats were trapped in my bedroom for two weeks.

9) Security deposit is not a security deposit. Never in my Life have I been compelled to negotiate with a petty thief

Their is a lot more. 24/7 is not 24/7 due to the lack of enouph Human Infrastructure to handle the Volume of calls. Resulting in knee jerk reaction's and bad decision making.

I cannot help get the feeling that AirBnb in my opinion would like low end Hosts to quietly fade and disappear in to the night.

This one will not.

The average star rating of my spare bed rooms was 4.5 Stars.

Skirting around the Franchise laws of the State of New York and the Federal Franchise Laws.

Skirting around the case law in New York State concerning Defamation and Slander.

And who knows what else. (SPIONS)

I am a fundamentaly good New Yorker. I am confident that my fellow New Yorkers will hear my cry for HELP.

I have been crippled financially by AirBnB's actions. Humiliated. Down but not out. I have nothing to loose. I am old sickly.

In my youth in basic training at the USMC. You learn the history of this Institution.

Lt. General Chesty Puller. "You don't hurt 'em if you don't hit 'em."

Below this you can read my reviews. It was AirBnB who cancelled the bookings and Defamed and Slandered this host. I removed most of the cancelations as the web page would have been to long.

The host canceled my reservation 11 days before arrival.

Emily The host canceled my reservation 46 days before arrival.

Alex The host canceled my reservation 16 days before arrival.

Katharina The host canceled my reservation 12 days before arrival.

Djamila The host canceled my reservation 32 days before arrival.

Amy The host canceled my reservation 22 days before arrival.

Wai The host canceled my reservation 5 days before arrival.

Dora The host canceled my reservation 15 days before arrival.

Melanie And Claas The host canceled my reservation 4 days before arrival.

Trevor The host canceled my reservation 18 days before arrival.

Liudmila The host canceled my reservation 90 days before arrival.

Jana Fabienne The host canceled my reservation 139 days before arrival.

Alisia The host canceled my reservation 3 days before arrival.

Francesca The host canceled my reservation 14 days before arrival.

Alonso I stayed here because I didn't want to spend a fortune in a hotel, so I booked at John's place. My room was pretty cozy, clean and had air conditioner (which was really helpful on those cold nights). The living room/kitchen/dinning room was ok, and I liked the fact that there were other guests living there as well and I met a lot of interesting people. I would recommend your stay here if you want to save money, socialize with other cultures and know how to clean after yourself (important part). It is up to you if you want a clean room. The walls are really thin and sometimes you can hear everything from the room next to yours, but overall, it is good place for low price.

Lauren Don't expect luxury &amp; do not come here if you're allergic to cats as John has 2 (very cute) or if you don't know how to clean up after yourself (you will get told!). This place is secure and very affordable for those on a budget, the beds/toilets/towels are clean and John offers coffee every morning. All in all, if you can forego any frills and live in a hostel environment, this is a good deal. If not, try the Waldorf Astoria.

Viola The place is just two blocks from the subway stop and it really takes 10 minutes to get to Manhattan so is ideal if you don't want to waste your day travelling. I have found quite a friendly bunch of people living in John's loft and John himself is a very helpful person. I would suggest to guests who have never seen NYC to ask him tips on what's worth seeing in the City. The constant presence of coffee in the place was, also, very much appreciate!!! My overall experience was pretty positive and I would recommend it.

Peter John was a very nice host. The room is great value for money. Expect no luxury, "this isn't the Waldorf-Astoria", as John would say. But it's a room, more or less private, allthough you can hear everything that's going on in the livingroom. But if you're in NYC for a few days, it's a great, cheap spot. The room I rented had some temperture-issues, the heater was a bit hard to control, and made some loud noises sometimes, but John told me this in advance. He was helpful all the way.

Kyle It was a nice private room! John was very helpful in getting me acclimated to New York City, and he even made me a nice BLT sandwich right when I arrived!

David Relacin calidad precio muy buena. Barrio"aburrido" pero el piso est muy bien conectado (parada de metro cerca). Spermercado cerca. Lo recomiendo positivamente para pasar ah unas vacaciones. John personalmente me trat muy bien. Incluso cuando tuve problemas con la habitacin S-9, la cual no recomiendo en invierno porque estn dentro las mquinas de la calefaccin central (mucho ruido y calor), fue fcil llegar a un acuerdo para que me diera otra habitacin que tena libre. No s que hubiese pasado si no hubiera habido alguna habitacin libre. En definitiva es un buen sitio para pasar tus vacaciones en NY a muy buen precio.

Johannes Best bang for the buck. Don't expect luxury and don't be too picky, but there's everything you need and it's a private room at a great rate. Quite uncomplicated, I could do some short notice extension as I decided to stay one night longer, and then even one more.

Iveta I've recently stayed at the shared room for 5 nights. It was a great experience, I can recommend this rental. John is a great host, he is going out of his way to accommodate everybody's requests. He is friendly and he is a great cook too! I am planning to be back in New York at the end of April and I will stay at this place again. I think that says a lot! it is a great place for a great price.

New Johns place is as described, a huge and quiet loft that he built. Not luxury but its a good way to save money if youre going to expend the whole day exploring the city. Its close to the subway station wiht direct line to manhattan (A and C line). John makes coffee every morning for the guests and he cleans the bathrooms every morning as well.

Veronika Great way to save money on a trip to NYC. Bring your own blankets because it gets very cold at night and there are none for you to use. The area is safe enough but it gets very deserted at night. Coffee in the mornings was great. Don't expect any privacy or luxury staying here but it is a cheap way to see NYC. FYI, smoking is allowed indoors and there are two cats. Average age of other guests is 22-25.

Camille Another host nearby could not host me. He sent me to John's place. As a young 18 year old french woman traveling alone I am careful. The accommodations were incredible for just $10. per day. $11. with the AirBnB fee. It is a medium size room. Very bright. Sun drenched as the host John says. Though it has 4 twin beds on 2 wooden bunks and one twin it is not cluster phobic. It is meant as a budget shared room to sleep in. The vanity was nice. Storage that I locked with a padlock. The rest of the Loft is large. Balcony's, gigantic rear deck and a giant private roof with nice views including Manhattan. I had the room all by myself. But met several interesting Europeans from Germany and Italy renting the private rooms. The common area is large. Nice kitchen dining area. Unusual. The large refrigerator is in the same room as the shower. John is an artist. The shower room is large. The host was very helpful. He showed me how to use the MTA Trip planner to efficiently travel to my activities in Manhattan. John has to be the best Host on AirBnB and possibly all of NYC ! Twice he made me a delicious meal ! 3-4 Minute walk to Subway. A metro. 20 minutes 34 street Manhattan off peak ! I am glad the other host cancelled. $10. nightly. safe, clean convenient, food. #1 host and place to stay in NYC. Oh it is $10. for thirty day stay. The price is more expensive for 3 days or a week but still cheapest in NYC ! Thank you John. 5 stars. He deserves 10 stars !

Guido John is a very good host... the loft is in a good neighborhood just short walk from a supermarket and utica subway station... and just 20 minutes far from Manhattan with public transprtation!!! Sure i would be back there next time i'm going to NYC! and if you are a good traveler who really wants to discover the real life of the place you are visiting sure you'll enjoy this place. Very safe, good wi fi connection, clean and easy! see you next time John!

Patrick This accomodation is by far the best value for a short-stay room in New York that I have seen. The cost for my own room per night actually worked out even cheaper than a hostel where a person would share a full dormitory of 6-8 people. This place was great value - and I had my own room. The host was very helpful. My first experience of his helpfulness was when I noticed that my computer cable had broken. When I asked him if he knew where I could get a replacement in the city, he actually went out of his way to fix the cable for me! He saved me a number of bucks doing this, and also saved me the time it would have taken to locate the replacement. Big thanks to him for that. And that was just the first day. The host has coffee on the stove every morning. It is also likely he will cook something for you a few times during your stay. It could be a roast, or it could be a big breakfast sandwich that will keep you going for a number of hours. The crowd that I came across in the place was mostly young and vibrant and interesting. It is a good place for you to meet up with like-minded adventurers in the city of New York. The host has a large amount of very practical local knowledge. He has a large willingness to share very useful knowledge with you. This was invaluable for me because, as a soon-to-be qualified attorney, I was in town to find out the possibilities of locating a long-term apartment lease and a job in the city. The host went out of his way to share his valuable knowledge with me about these things. The host is worth listening to carefully. The quality of the place was very satisfactory. If you are a complainer or nit-picker, or have impossibly high standards, don't waste anybody's time and get a 150 buck a night hotel instead. However, if you want something with great value and have realistic expectations of what great value is, then you will really benefit from staying in a place like this. Even though I give a 4-star rating (which is very good), I actually give the extra 5th star in the rating when I factor in the price and all the extras. Again, have realistic expectations for a place in this price range, and appreciate good value when you see it, despite being a little rough around the edges. Furthermore, as time goes on, the host continually makes improvements to the place and has a genuine commitment to creating accomodation that adds value to the people who stay there. I expect the place will only become better and better in the future.

Matthew 5 stars! I had a great stay with John in his loft apartment. His description of the living space is very accurate. My room was clean and spacious, the loft was quiet through the night (had no disruptions from flatmates in other rooms), the bathrooms were clean and John even cooked 2 meals for me during my stay (quite the chef I might add)! For the price range and location, this listing can't be beat!

Stephanie John is a welcoming friendly host. Staying at his place in a private room beats staying at a hostel sharing with 3-11 other unknowns. Also he makes sure he only rents to non-sketchy people, which can only be a good thing. It's close to Manhattan, the neighbourhood doesn't look safe but is actually really ok and I doubt you can get a better deal than this. Peace out!

J. B. John is a gracious and welcoming host. The property is as described, and the bed is very comfortable. The place (as stated) is rough-hewn, but clean, quiet., and comfortable. The A train express is just two blocks away, so this is very convenient to Manhattan.

Stephanie We transferred to another room because it was cheaper. But it's not that small - still a good size AND it's private after all. John offered us some dinner one day which was pretty darn good. He does keep things clean around here (but a lot of it depends on other guests here too) so he's a good host.

Bettina John's Place is very close to the train station and in a safe area. I never felt insecure during the whole stay. The rooms are in a loft and have all the advantages of a loft: the common room, that everybody can use, is big and there are several very big patios which is great for summer. You are welcome to use the big kitchen and because John is a great cook, you should accept his weekly invitation for a meal. John also knows a lot about New York and has a lot of material and information to share. He answered my E-mails amazingly fast and helped us a lot to find the way from the airport to his place. On the other side, you should be aware, that the walls in the loft are very thin and you can hear everything. During the night it sometimes became very cold in the rooms, because the rooms are very high and the heat accumulated under the ceiling. There is just one shared shower for all. Altogether it's a nice place to stay. But if you want to stay in New York for several weeks, you should first test this place for some days and then decide if this is the right place for you. Best wishes, Bettina

Isabella The place is really nice and clean and super close to the subway. My room had a beautiful view and a comfy bed. John can be a little intense, on the first night he was quite annoyed with me for catching a cab as he said cab drivers were "crooks" but after that he was very helpful and pleasant. Even gave me some delicious roast he made and let me hang out past check out time. All in all it was a good experience.

Stephanie Really nice spacious room which I shared with my cousin and we had ample space for all our stuff. The location is pretty near to the station, about five minutes walk away. John is a really helpful host and made sure we had a place to stay on New Year's night when he found out that we didn't have anywhere to go for that night. And honestly I don't think you'll find a better deal for the price you pay, especially if you're travelling alone in NYC :)

Yoojin I couldn't agree more with Nacio's exact review. Close distance from subway station and warm rooms are good. However, if you are sensitive to cigarette smoke, I don't recommend this place. He smokes inside the house and rooms for guests have a big glassless hole facing kitchen where he usually smoke. Considering the cheap price of room, you may bear some shortcomings.. but I don't think it's comfortable to live for a long time in this house.

Ling Sum Great stay, great location! John is a perfect host. The room is big enough. The neighborhood is safe!

Adam Hey travelers! I stayed at john's space in crown heights, Brooklyn for 10 days &amp; would recommend it to any of you out there on a budget who don't need many frills. It feels like a cross between a hostel &amp; a friend's place - there were long term &amp; short term guests here - everyone was respectful &amp; quiet. Excellent value for money &amp; steps away from 24 hour transit anywhere in NYC. The shower needs improvement but it's a great place to hang yer hat. Would/will stay here again. Thanks John, Merry holiday everyone!!! Adam

Cristina I wouldn't choose Jonn's in matter of the size of the room. But it was comfortable and the practical facilities all right. Besides the room there is a ' shared space' where it is possible to spend time/ do activities if the space of the room isnt 'satisfying' which works fine. The bed was fine. Transport to Manhattan is easy.

Carmen If you are considering a hostel, this would be a much better choice. The rooms are private; there is a fridge, basic cooking facilities and John makes coffee every morning. John gives fair warning about the neighborhood and I certainly wouldn't walk around late at night, but it is very near the train, the grocery store and laundromat are walking distance and the neighborhood folk are generally friendly. It is definitely worth the price.

Giorgio Nice room, close to subway station and to everything, few minutes to Manhattan. Mattresses, sheetes and pillows where new when we arrived. John is funny and very helpful, he gave us a lot of advices.

Nirmal Good place overall. Pros: own room with lock and key, on A express line, cheap Cons: My clothes smelled like smoke, cats kept me up 3 nights, the fridge is in the bathroom for some reason. the area is a little ghetto but overall safe since very close to the main road. John and everyone in the house is friendly and keep the place clean, though i bought my own cleaning wipes and cleaned the toilets few times. I expected that since the place has 9 rooms and just 2 toilets and 1 bathroom. john was very gracious and offered dinner on more than 2 occasions. for $29 a night it was a bargain.

Isabell It's a good place to stay for a few weeks if you need an affordable homebase while you're exploring the city The subway is just a short walk away, it takes about 20 minutes to get to the west side of downtown Manhattan, which for New York is very okay. John is a helpful host, often offering his guests food and good advice or tips on where to go and how to get there. There is a large common area with a kitchen that holds everything you need; the bathrooms and shower are also shared by all. Rooms have loft beds, drawers, chairs, tables, lamps - in short, everything you need. If anything's missing, just ask; John is quite good at providing anything extra (for example the extension cord and socket adapter I needed to get comfortable in bed with my laptop). If you have any more questions, just ask, I'll be happy to help you out.

Adam I stayed at Johns place for just over a week. The location of the place is great, only a short walk to the train station and ~10 min to lower Manhattan. There was also on the street parking easily available. John was a great host, provided me information on how to get around and also recommended some places to check out. Its great value for money, would stay here again if I'm in NYC. Room was sun drenched and clean. He offered coffee every morning. The complimentary BLT he made for me was delicious. If anyone has any questions just send me an email.

Elena Yo y mi amigo nos hospedamos en una habitacin preciosa baada por el sol. La casa situada en un barrio seguro y autentico newyorkino estaba a pocos minutos del metro. John es muy simptico y habla espaol nos ayudo mucho ofreciendo su ayuda para organizar nuestro viaje mejor. Gracias John!

Rhona Very helpful when we had a last minute emergency, my daughter was in New York without internet and I was in Scotland and I had to find her somewhere quickly. He replied immediately and made up the room for her. She says it was great to have a private room and room to open a case and hang up clothes. Easy to come and go as you get your own key and it's close to everything you need especially the subway. She says she felt safe in the house and the neighbourhood, even as a solo female. Complimentary coffee was also nice as was the BLT he made one day. CommentLoading... Repost 1:16 on Tue Mar 27 2012 Cannot add comment if you are logged out.

I'm interested in the idea of an exchange-traded fund that is directly controlled by its shareholders (ETF: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund). Existing ETFs are either passively managed and track a stock index (Dow, S&amp;P, etc) or are actively managed and generally don't beat the market. Does a publicly-traded investment fund that relies on its shareholders for all transactional decisions make sense?

For companies that are already listed on national and international stock exchanges, the wisdom of the crowds may be of real value. I think the crowd could be particularly effective at spotting high-growth public companies in the US and abroad. My hypothesis is that a large group of retail investors collaborating on company research and stock selection can outperform the market and most professional investment managers.

I'm curious about anyone's thoughts on this idea.
