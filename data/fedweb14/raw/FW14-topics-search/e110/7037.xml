I'm a journalist and contributing editor at Tech Review. I've been lucky to have some of my work featured on HN, and I find it a consistently excellent source of thought-provoking ideas. I'm wondering how 1) HN keeps the signal:noise ratio high, and 2) whether this might be generalizable to other communities on the web. I hope to include any responses to this question in a write-up on Tech Review. Thanks.

I'm wondering how many days in advance should we contact bloggers, journalists, and start doing PR (press releases, etc..) before a launch? (so they have time to review the service, write the article)

Also, what is the best time/day for launch? Most people say Tuesday at 10AM (pacific time).

Any advice or experience that you guys have about conducting a successful product launch?

Thanks!
