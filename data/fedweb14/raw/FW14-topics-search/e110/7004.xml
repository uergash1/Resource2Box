Some RDS machines of us-east-1 went down today. And I was like, Who cares? I have Multi A-Z so I'm covered. Well I was not... Multi A-Z didn't work, the machine kept booting on the same availability zone and it was impossible to get access to it. According to Amazon's Console this was due to "Timed out waiting for a state safe to initiate user requested failover" . And that made me think. Accordingly from what I've read online, "Multi A-Z makes a hot copy of the production instance. If this instance fails In three minutes you'll be in a 'backup instance' exactly as the production instance". But what if I'm writing something to the DB and the disk fails? The database will get corrupted, and If they're really making a hot copy of the disk, how can they (Amazon) ensure the customer that the data of the "backup instances" will not get corrupted? Amazon's support team couldn't give me an answer. But they told me that they will get in touch with me when they get more information from the RDS engineering team. I also asked WHY Multi A-Z didn't work, and they didn't have an answer for that either. Does anyone know HOW does Multi A-Z really work, and how does amazon's ensure consistency in data? What will be the best infrastructure to get high-availability on databases in an Amazon environment? Thank you so much!

I'm about to order a Sony Vaio Z Series, with Core i7, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 1920x1080 screen, and I was wondering if someone had a similar machine and successfully installed Arch Linux on it. Perhaps partially, with some features not working, like the speed/stamina switch, or any other feature.

I would also be interested in experiences installing other linux distros on a Z Series Vaio.

Seems like such a trivial question, but I'm stumped..

Can someone point me to a webpage where I can see a list of CSS properties applicable to each html tag? (e.g. the styles applicable to an &lt;a&gt; are: x, y, z....)

If this question demonstrates some underlying misunderstanding of CSS then please let me know. I've just started learning CSS, and so far it is my least favorite 'means of instructing a machine what to do' ever...

Tried googling it, didnt find anything.

thanks
