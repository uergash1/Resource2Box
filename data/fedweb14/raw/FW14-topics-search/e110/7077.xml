I was researching for a blog post and wanted your input, looking at the google trends (http://www.google.com/trends?q=ruby+on+rails%2C+django&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0) the momentum for Rails has drastically come down while interest for Django has been skyrocketing. Can you think of any key drivers for the change?

Hi,

I'm a web-developer, I love working with a django stack (django/postgres/south/redis/celery/etc), and I've deployed apps myself on ec2 or hosted on dotcloud.

I'd like to be able to iterate through some product ideas so I'm very price-conscious. Ideally I don't want to be charged 10x for hosting 10 web-apps, I want to be charged by traffic. For example if 1 app gets sticky and 9 suck, I shouldn't be charged much more than if I had 1 good app and 1 bad one.

Hosting on EC2 or Linode seems great for this, but I'm actually not super-comfortable with the sysadmin side of things, so I'd prefer to use a Heroku/Gondor or something similar.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks!

Hey guys, I am looking to finally get in to web development with Django. Django and Python are in a weird stage right now, add in the fact I don't have any development experience and I am lost on how I should get started. I am first year CS student and have been learning Java in class, but I have taught myself Python at the same pace and am more comfortable programming in Python. I have been using 3.xx, not that it is a huge deal for Python, but I am wondering if I should try to use the latest version of Django so I can use the same version of Python I have been using.

My main question though is what is the best way to learn Django? I do not have ANY experience with a framework like this, my only experience is Python, HTML, CSS, some Javascript and a little bit of jQuery. Many people say just to use the documentary online, and I feel this would be good if I had some kind of development background. I am really looking for a book to purchase that is focused towards teaching the basics inside and out. From there I can start to hack stuff together and go off on my own, that is just the way I learn. So if you guys would suggest a book, what would it be? Otherwise what other options should I consider?
