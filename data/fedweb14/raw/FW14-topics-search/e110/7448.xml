Dear HN friends,

Please help me with ideas/activities to do in the Silicon Valley and Boston area. It has been two years since I've had a proper vacation, and I'd like to invest my time wisely. I created an editable document listing the objectives below: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qhDkdt6AP4f9M58DSQ3ZHYeKlxArsGGn7kCIWMJlbCs/edit

I'm an aspiring entrepreneur/maker from Saudi Arabia, 28 years old, unmarried. I'm a pretty good software developer (on the side) but I work in business development (running the coolest business incubator in the country!). I'm looking for things to do within the realm of entrepreneurship, product development, design, art, and software development.

I don't mind working for ultra-cool studios/shops/places/individuals for a week or so. I can offer fast-paced software development skills and mediocre business development insight. I am well-rounded and very curious. I would consider this journey a success if I 1) learn new things and 2) network with the right people.

I am also considering the idea of building a product in 30 days in SV and then go to China for the last 10 days to mass produce - got nothing to loose, why not try? I will evaluate this based on my options.

Thanks, A. Naimi http://anaimi.com (blog) http://burkanlabs.com (part-time startup) http://twitter/anaimi
