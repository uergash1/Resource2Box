Having a debate over coffee with someone on this today and was wondering. In theory, does Facebook (and others company's who do this with key people) only paying Mark Zuckerberg a $1 salary break minimum wage rules?

If facebook is selling your information, would it be possible for them to pay you a small percentage of the information they sell about you? I understand that they don't and wouldn't do that, but would that motivate you to openly social network? I mean its creepy that they sell your info and advertise based on it, but what if you could see a log file of the exact information being sold and where its being sold to. Would this make you feel better about sharing information?

This is my first time applying to summer internships, and it's very hard to find concrete salary numbers on internships. For example, I have anecdotal evidence of Google and Facebook paying $18-20k for a 12-week internship.

To make it more specific, I'm applying as a software developer to Silicon Valley startups. I'm a college sophomore.

What is an average salary for an intern at such a company? Are internship salaries negotiable? Should I expect an internship salary to be equivalent to a starting salary at a company?

And finally, why are such numbers so hard to find?

Hey,

I've recently created a few Android apps to learn Spanish and French. The app basically has a long list of words, it dictates you a word in english, and then says it in Spanish. When I wanted to learn Spanish, I found that this technique was really helpful to quickly learn vocabulary, and works while I'm commuting, which saves a lot of time.

Now this app is pretty original, and is very simple to use, but as there is tons of language learning apps in the Android market, my app is always listed like 20-30th in the list when searching. I would like to know if there is an easy way to promote my apps. I've previously tried to promote some apps on Facebook by paying 30$, but it never compensated for the price gained afterwards. I've created some free versions so that people can try it out, but still not a lot of purchases.

I would like to know if someone has managed to successfully market their apps, without paying 1000$ out of the pocket ? I'm not looking to make a salary with these apps, but at least compensating me for the time I spend programming them :).

Thank you for any help. I'm sure this topic will help other people discover some tricks!

Here are my apps if someone is interested:

French: Free: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.pervychine.learn_french_lite Paid: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.pervychine.learn_french
