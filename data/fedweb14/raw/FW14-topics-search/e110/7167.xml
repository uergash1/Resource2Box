After over 10 years of becoming gradually removed from development (as a director of a 50+ person company), I've taken a head-first dive back into it while I travel around the world and freelance.

What tools/software do you currently use for web development, on a Mac platform? I'm not attached to anything, and want to use whatever will make me most efficient (even at an initial cost). Here's my current set-up (mostly PHP development). I should also note that, because of intermittent wi-fi access while traveling, I usually prefer native desktop apps to web apps.

* MacBook (aluminium) with a small Verbatim back-up drive and hard case (I'm traveling the world at the moment), plus Time Machine

* DropBox for real-time backing up my ~/Sites/ and other important directories

* MAMP Pro for easy administration of the LAMP stack

* Quicksilver (I find it fractions-of-a-second faster than Spotlight, which makes a difference)

* InstantShot and Paparazzi! for website screenshots (for pitches, etc)

* SimpleTask (for To-Do list)

* Mail.app (managing multiple accounts, including Gmail)

* TextWrangler (as my main text editor / IDE - I'm especially not tied to this)

* Filezilla (SFTP/FTP/etc)

* Terminal (love the multi-tabs; always have a tab open with a grep -R ready for searching; find it much faster than using an in-IDE search across files)

* Chrome (with the Web Developer extension) as my main browser; also Firefox, Safari

* Parallels with Windows 7 (to run Internet 8/7 natively with debugging tools; prefer it to WineBottler, etc)

* Skype (for cheap/free conversations and screen-sharing with clients)

* OmniGraffle Pro (UX, Wireframing, sketching)

* Fireworks (Graphics work)

* Flux (for making late-night work semi-comfortable)

* Silverback (usability testing)

Anything I should switch-out or add? I'm looking for efficiency and speed over detailed configuration, open source / licensing or price. Thanks in advance, HN'ers!
