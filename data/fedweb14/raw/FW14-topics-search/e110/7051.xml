I run an internet startup but used to be an ex-Mgmt consultant from a top firm and came from a b-school background. The peer pressure was quite a bit to join one of the top consulting firms or IB firms regardless of what you actually enjoyed doing. People would spend hours on Vault to get advise on applications, interviews etc. I was surprised to see a similar thread about YC here- http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=518656

This got me thinking, if, in another 10-15 years, getting into a top "branded" program like YCombinator, TechStars etc... be more socially prestigious than joining a brand name firm?

Or am I a dinosaur and has it already happened?
