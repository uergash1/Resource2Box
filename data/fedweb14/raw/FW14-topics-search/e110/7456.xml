Today I saw something strange on my HTC Desire: Every time I resumed from standby, the GPS indicator was on. I haven't seen this before, so I figured it was a new app or an update. I went through the apps I had most recently updated, uninstalled each one and checked if the GPS indicator would disappear. After uninstalling Bump, it no longer used the GPS.

The Bump page on Android Market has several reviews stating the same thing: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bumptech.bumpga&amp;hl=en

After the recent iPhone "locationgate", I thought it would be of some interest.
