When the time came to leave, his car wouldn't start, and it was too late to call the local service station. 

The husband urged Charlie to stay over. There was no spare bed in the house; there wasn't even a sofa. So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife taped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her. "I couldn't do that," he whispered. "Your husband is my best friend!" "Listen, sugar," she whispered back, "there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake hime up now." "I can't believe that," Charlie said. "Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he? "Sugar, he certainly won't. If you don't believe me, pluck a hair out of his asshole and see if that wakes him." Charlie did just that. He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her. 

When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again. Again he pulled a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep. This went on eight times during the night. Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's asshole hairs. 

The ninth time he pulled a hair, the husband awoke and muttered: "Listen, Charlie, old pal, I don't mind you fucking my wife, but for Pete's sake, stop using my ass for a scoreboard!"</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e083-7146-03"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e083/7146_03.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 15:45:03">http://kickasshumor.com/funny-joke/6053/six-retired-floridians-play-high-stakes-poker-in-t</link><title>Long Joke</title><description>Six retired Floridians play high stakes poker in the condo clubhouse. 

A member of the group, Meiers, loses $5,000 on a single hand, clutches his chest and drops dead at the table. 

Showing respect for their fallen comrade, the other five finish playing the hand standing up. 

Finkelstein looks around and asks, "So, who's gonna' tell his wife?" 

They cut the cards, and Goldberg "wins" the duty. They tell him to be discreet, be gentle, not to make a bad situation any worse. 

"Discreet? I'm the most discreet person you'll ever meet. Discretion is my middle name," he says. Leave it to me." 

Goldberg goes over to the Meiers' apartment and knocks on the door. Mrs. Meiers wife answers and asks what he wants. 

Goldberg declares, "Your husband just lost $5,000 playing poker, and is afraid to come home." 

"Tell him to drop dead!" says the wife. 

"Will do," he says.</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e083-7146-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e083/7146_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 15:46:10">http://kickasshumor.com/funny-joke/6709/previous-next-an-irishman-drinks-at-the-</link><title>Short Joke</title><description>Previous Next 
An Irishman drinks at the pub until they close. 

He stands up to leave and falls flat on his face. He tries to stand one more time and falls again. He figures he'll crawl outside and get some fresh air and maybe that will sober him up. 

Outside, he tries to stand up and falls flat again. He gives up and crawls the four blocks to his house, crawls up the stairs and pulls himself into bed. 

The next morning, his wife stands over him shouting, "So, you've been out boozing again!" 

"What makes you say that?" he asks, putting on an innocent face. 

"The pub called -- you left your wheelchair there again."</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e083-7146-05"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e083/7146_05.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 15:46:51">http://kickasshumor.com/funny-joke/8054/there-was-this-guy-at-a-bar-just-looking-at-his-d</link><title>Long Joke</title><description>There was this guy at a bar, just looking at his drink. He stays like that for half of an hour. 

Then, this big trouble-making truck driver steps next to him, takes the drink from the guy, and just drinks it all down. The poor man starts crying. The truck driver says, "Come on man, I was just joking. Here, I'll buy you another drink. I just can't stand to see a man cry." 

"No, it's not that. This day is the worst of my life. First, I fall asleep, and I go late to my office. My boss, outrageous, fires me. When I leave the building, to my car, I found out it was stolen. The police said that they can do nothing. I get a cab to return home, and when I leave it, I remember I left my wallet and credit cards there. The cab driver just drives away." 

"I go home, and when I get there, I find my wife in bed with the gardener. I leave home, and come to this bar. And just when I was thinking about putting an end to my life, you show up and drink my poison.</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
