Many groundwater aquifers are pumped more quickly than they can be replenished, meaning wells have to be drilled deeper and deeper to reach an ever-diminishing resource. The Ogallala Aquifer, which extends from Nebraska to Texas, is a prime example. There, groundwater irrigation h...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e167-7095-04"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e167/7095_04.html" timestamp="2014-04-21 08:35:40">http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/02/reverse-alchemy-replacing-precious-platinum-with-ignoble-iron/</link><title>Reverse alchemy: replacing precious platinum with ignoble iron</title><description>... managed to substitute an iron-based one.
