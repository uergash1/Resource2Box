They are one of the most successful targeted cancer therapies that have been tried. But that success has been limited by toxicity issues.Now, monoclonal antibodies have been paired with photodynamic therapy, which harnesses a photosensitizing chemical agent to allow light of a chosen wavelength to kill cells. This approach...</description></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e167-7405-02"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e167/7405_02.html" timestamp="2014-04-24 03:28:00">http://arstechnica.com/science/2011/07/the-future-of-lighting/</link><title>The future of lighting: walls of light, LEDs, and glowing trees</title><description>...Light bulbs haven't been sexy tech since Thomas Edison's day, but innovation has come to an industry that has seen relatively little of it for a century.

Take a sugar cube for instance: an individual sugar crystal is quite transparent, but the tiny reflections from its surface act to scatter the light a little bit.
