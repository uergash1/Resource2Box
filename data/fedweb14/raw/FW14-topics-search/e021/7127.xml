Australian police closed off the area around the Chinese consulate in Sydney after a robbery suspect fled into the grounds. Heavily armed officers raced to the scene as the situation turned into a six-hour siege. Police said a number of shots were fired during the stand-off. The drama unfolded on Friday and details at this stage are scant. Local television reports said the siege began after an attempted robbery at a nearby bar went wrong. The reports said one suspect was arrested at the bar. The other fled into the grounds of the consulate in a lane behind it. That man was later reported to have been arrested and taken to hospital.
