Cystic Fibrosis Life Expectancy: 30, 50, 70… - Trailer Cystic Fibrosis Treatment, Cystic Fibrosis Therapies, Symptoms and Stages of CF, Cure Cystic Fibrosis http://www.amazon.com/Cystic-Fibrosis-Life-Expectancy-ebook/dp/B00793UMNQ/ The book “Cystic Fibrosis Life Expectancy: 30, 50, 70…” describes a clinical therapy, cystic fibrosis pathophysiology, and treatment successfully used by more than 150 Soviet and Russian doctors on people with cystic fibrosis. While treating their patients, these doctors applied the breathing technique used for the best ever known clinical trials on metastatic cancer and asthma. The name of this legendary technique is the Buteyko breathing method. It includes breathing exercises, physical exercises, and lifestyle changes. This therapy is based on the DIY body oxygen test, and the goal of the therapy is to increase body oxygenation up to the medical norm (40 seconds). These Soviet and Russian doctors discovered that stages and symptoms of cystic fibrosis have a strong correlation with body O2 levels. * More than 40 seconds for body oxygenation: Absence of common digestive, respiratory and other symptoms of cystic fibrosis. * Less than 30 seconds: Appearance and dominance of pathogens in the GI tract with light symptoms in pulmonary and hormonal areas. * Less than 20 s: Chronic cell hypoxia, suppression of the immune system, serious respiratory and digestive symptoms with chronic inflammation. * Less than 10 s: The last stage of CF with critically low CO2 levels in airways causing progressive involvement of the respiratory system and the end-stage lung disease. These observations helped Soviet and Russian MDs to develop a method how to reverse the usual dynamic and successfully eliminate major symptoms of CF, including cystic fibrosis carrier nasal polyps. The therapy has been successfully tested on hundreds of people with cystic fibrosis who slowed down their breathing back to the medical norm (real stories). The book does not provide details of the Buteyko breathing exercises that can be found in the book "Advanced Buteyko Breathing Exercises". The book offers a description of major lifestyle modules to increase body O2 naturally, as well as specific techniques that are crucial for people with cystic fibrosis. The book “Cystic Fibrosis Life Expectancy: 30, 50, 70…” by Dr. Artour Rakhimov can be found in Kindle and paperback formats on Amazon.com. There is also a PDF version of the book.
