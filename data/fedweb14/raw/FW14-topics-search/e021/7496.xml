Published on Apr 11, 2013 SINGAPORE: The admission of foreign senior counsel, such as a Queen's Counsel, could be granted in cases where the interests of an individual or issues pertaining solely to that individual "are so out of the ordinary that they require special consideration", Judge of Appeal V K Rajah said Wednesday. For example, an individual may be able to establish that his case is exceptional if he can prove that, despite all reasonable efforts conscientiously made, he cannot find any competent local counsel to represent him. This "exceptional case" would then constitute as a "special reason" under the Legal Profession Act, said Justice Rajah in a 50-page judgment released on Wednesday. www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/j­udge-explains-why-city/635346.html
