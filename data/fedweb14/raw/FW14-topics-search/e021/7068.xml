IBM (IBM) and Nuance Communications (NUAN) announced a research agreement to explore, develop and commercialize the Watson computing system's advanced analytics capabilities in the healthcare industry. The research and technology initiative will combine IBM's Deep Question Answering, or QA, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning capabilities with Nuance's speech recognition and Clinical Language Understanding, or CLU, solutions for the diagnosis and treatment of patients that provide hospitals, physicians and payers access to critical and timely information. The two companies expect the first commercial offerings from the collaboration to be available in 18-24 months. Additionally, Columbia University Medical Center and the University of Maryland School of Medicine are contributing their medical expertise and research to the collaborative effort.

The last three weeks, I've had the pleasure of working with the Machine Learning for Signal Processing Group at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. If you noticed that the settings seemed a bit different on some of my previous videos, you were right! I was couchsurfing (google it!) in Pittsburgh the last three weeks. But anyways, back to the MLSP. The MLSP is led by Bhiksha Raj and Rita Singh, and is part of the Language Technology Institute at CMU, which is regarded as pretty much the TOP place for language technology in the world. Pretty cool! Their group has about a half dozen graduate students at the moment. Some of the MLSP's projects are robust speech recognition, source separation, dereverberation, and language processing. For more info, please check out http://ayesha.lti.cs.cmu.edu/mlsp/ Lyrics MLSP, learning with machines MLSP, signal processing If you're looking for the latest research In language and technology Then make your way on out to the city of steel Where you'll find it at the MLSP At Carnegie Mellon U in the Language Technology Institute, Although they're working hard, there's a playfulness in the air Because everyone's loving what they do Bhiksha Raj and Rita Singh Lead their graduate students fearlessly As a student, you couldn't ask for more So listen here, you students, what whatcha waiting for!

Workshop: Advances in Speech TechnologiesJune 23, 2011 | IRCAM----Speech Analysis, Synthesis and Transformation in the Analysis/Synthesis Team at IRCAMAxel Roebel and Xavier RodetIRCAM. Analysis and Synthesis TeamSpeech Analysis, Synthesis and Transformation in the Analysis/Synthesis Team at IRCAMFor the past 7 years or so, the interest of composers and musical assistants at IRCAM in speech synthesis and transformation techniques has continued to grow. As a result, speech processing has become one of the central research objectives of the Analysis/Synthesis team at IRCAM. In this introduction some of the key results of the research efforts carried out will be presented, providing examples, notably related to the estimation of the spectral envelope, the estimation of the LF glottal pulse model parameters, text-to-speech synthesis, shape invariant signal transformation in the phase vocoder, speaker transformation, voice conversion, and transformation of emotional states.This workshop was organized by Nicolas Obin - IRCAM.

The Calculators: Discovering the Women Computers of WWIIThe Long Now Foundation - Herbst TheatreWhen the digital universe began, in 1951 in New Jersey, it was just 5 kilobytes in size. "That's just half a second of MP3 audio now," said Dyson. The place was the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. The builder was engineer Julian Bigelow. The instigator was mathematician John von Neumann. The purpose was to design hydrogen bombs.Bigelow had helped develop signal processing and feedback (cybernetics) with Norbert Wiener. Von Neumann was applying ideas from Alan Turing and Kurt Gödel, along with his own. They were inventing and/or gates, addresses, shift registers, rapid-access memory, stored programs, a serial architecture-all the basics of the modern computer world, all without thought of patents. While recuperating from brain surgery, Stanislaw Ulam invented the Monte Carlo method of analysis as a shortcut to understanding solitaire. Shortly Von Neumann's wife Klári was employing it to model the behavior of neutrons in a fission explosion. By 1953, Nils Barricelli was modeling life itself in the machine-virtual digital beings competed and evolved freely in their 5-kilobyte world."In the few years they ran that machine, from 1951 to 1957, they worked on the most difficult problems of their time, five main problems that are on very different time scales-26 orders of magnitude in time-from the lifetime of a neutron in a bomb's chain reaction measured in billionths of a second, to the behavior of shock waves on the scale of seconds, to weather prediction on a scale of days, to biological evolution on the scale of centuries, to the evolution of stars and galaxies over billions of years. And our lives, measured in days and years, is right in the middle of the scale of time. I still haven't figured that out."Julian Bigelow was frustrated that the serial, address-constrained, clock-driven architecture of computers became standard because it is so inefficient. He thought that templates (recognition devices) would work better than addresses. The machine he had built for von Neumann ran on sequences rather than a clock. In 1999 Bigelow told George Dyson, "Sequence is different from time. No time is there." That's why the digital world keeps accelerating in relation to our analog world, which is based on time, and why from the perspective of the computational world, our world keeps slowing down.The acceleration is reflected in the self-replication of computers, Dyson noted: "By now five or six trillion transistors per second are being added to the digital universe, and they're all connected." Dyson is a kayak builder, emulating the wood-scarce Arctic natives to work with minimum frame inside a skin craft. But in the tropics, where there is a surplus of wood, natives make dugout canoes, formed by removing wood. "We're now surrounded by so much information," Dyson concluded, "we have to become dugout canoe builders. The buzzword of last year was 'big data.' Here's my definition of the situation: Big data is what happened when the cost of storing information became less than the cost of throwing it away."-- by Stewart Brand
