Toegevoegd door Express News 3 weken geleden

On a fine morning of April 1, about 14 years ago, my grandmother departed from this world, leaving us in deep grief and sorrow. In addition to this sad news, we, as a family, faced quite some embarrassment owing to the fateful date of my grandmother’s demise. I picked up a phone book to inform all my relatives (parental and maternal) about this sad news. Most of the relatives lived in far-flung districts. I was subjected to some highly awkward inquiries by some of the relatives as to whether the news was truthful, or I was merely pulling a fast one on April Fools’ Day. It might appear comical to the reader, but this is a highly taxing reaction for someone who is struck by grief. Calls followed return calls. Relatives shook their heads, chuckled once or twice and then put down the phone. They rang up again to inquire if the death had actually taken place. It was chaotic. Often, we had to call twice and thrice to each relative to confirm that my grandmother was no more. After repeated attempts, the news sunk it, but the tediousness of communicating this loss was not overcome by any soothing words or messages of sorrow that relatives gave us. Since the day, April 1 has become the day when our entire family recalls that comical-cum-embarrassing episode — with not much fondness, dare I mention. My mother felt more pain as her mother was no more and she often questions why such nonsensical ‘days’ are celebrated at all. I do not know why such days are celebrated to take pleasure. But I do know that sometimes, these ‘days’ bring more tears than laughter. Often, when people make jokes, bad and unfortunate news is communicated to loved ones and their reactions are then enjoyed. This is perhaps why some people put up their defences so fast and refuse to believe when tragedies actually happen on April 1. Only maturity can bring positive change in our attitude. Such worthless jokes and non-serious behaviour cannot add any gold tags to our character as a nation. Published in The Express Tribune, April 1st, 2014.
