Identity Dynamics Within the Diverse Asian CultureThe Asia Society - Time Warner HQHow do you understand your ethnic identity? While 'Asians' are often referred to as one demographic, in reality there are more than 20 Asian ethnicities in the U.S. with a diverse breakout of countries of ancestry. With this diversity, there is a wide range of identifiers: 3rd Generation Asian American, Immigrant, International Student, American-born Asian, or 1.5 generation Asian. Any of these can be a valid descriptor for how Asians in America might identify themselves. How does your identity drive how you interact with others? How do stereotypes and perceptions affect career mobility and success? We will explore cultural gaps that emerge in a diverse workforce as well as discuss the impact of Asian APA identity and level of acculturation on career mobility."
