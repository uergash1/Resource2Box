The Smithsonian Museum will open a special exhibit that showcases the history of yoga, and they asked for donations to make it happen. They raised 170 thousand dollars, which exceeded their goal of 125 thousand dollars.The Smithsonian Museum will open a special exhibit that showcases the history of yoga, and they used crowd-funding to make it happen. It is the first exhibit to use this kind of online fundraising campaign. Allison Peck, head of public affairs and marketing at the Smithsonian galleries where the exhibit will be held said:: “I know that the eyes of the museum world have been on us as we try this, especially the larger art museums, to see if something they could attempt…in the next few months we'll do a lot of analysis about what we can take from this in terms of how we reach out to people in fundraising, and whether it's something we could try again.” They raised 170 thousand dollars, (1,headline) which exceeded their goal of 125 thousand dollars. Over 600 donors gave money, including Whole Foods, which donated 70 thousand dollars. The exhibit will open at the Freer and Sackler galleries of the Smithsonian during October of this year. Yoga has recently been accepted by mainstream popular American culture, but it has been around for thousands of years, and has a long history in a variety of cultures.

http://satyogainstitute.org/ Student Question: In the seminar last weekend you said that archetypes are the ones that are running history and our lives. Can you give a little more information on that? "Well at a certain moment in history there was a choice made, not at a conscious but at a super-conscious level . . . within not only the human species but within the realm of all the actants—no longer to support the dharma. And the dharma then—at an archetypal level—recognized that it must go into exile. And the world was then run by false powers," explains Shunyamurti, the spiritual director of the Sat Yoga Institute in Costa Rica. And it is only through the archetypes—not through any individual ego—that the dharma will return. And it is at this moment in history—when all love seems to have disappeared from the planet—that it must and will return.
