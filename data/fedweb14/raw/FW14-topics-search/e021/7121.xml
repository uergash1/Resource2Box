Pratyusha Banerjee has been in the news ever since the actor confirmed doing Bigg Boss season 7. Initially it was about joining the controversial show as a contestant, then it was about posing in a bikini, her grand birthday bash, her ex-boyfriend Makrand Malhotra and now we hear there’s a new man in the scene. A few days back we had reported that Pratz has lodged a complaint at the police station against ex-boyfriend businessman Makrand. It seems Mr Malhotra was harassing her ever since he saw her with another man.
