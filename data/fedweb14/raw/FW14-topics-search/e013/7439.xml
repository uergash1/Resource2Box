The new position brought Villars an additional 800 livres a year, as he was privileged to retain the pension of 1000 livres granted by the intendant. This recognized both his continuing work in botany and his need to pay for a second domicile in Grenoble. Even though Villars continued to give his annual series of botanical lectures, which would seem to have been a justification for additional remuneration, his relative wealth seems to have sparked jealousy within the small medical staff To make matters more uncomfortable for him, he found a disagreeable rivalry between the physicians and surgeons of the city and the Brothers of Charity who administered the hospital for the crown, led by Father Dominique Durand, a surgeon.278 One can only surmise that, under such circumstances, the continuing peaceful and congenial association with Father Chaix provided Villars with more than a valued botanical collaboration.
