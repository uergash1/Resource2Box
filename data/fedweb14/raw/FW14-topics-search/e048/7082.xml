The game challenges the player with difficult but interesting questions. Players must answer as quickly as possible since the points decrease every second. One round is all you need to see how fun this game is; we guarantee you’ll be hooked. Challenging Questions Tired of trivia games that are too easy? Most of the questions are based off things you NEVER learn in school meaning that most people can’t get more then half the questions in a round correct! No Repeats We track questions answered to make sure the player won’t see the same question again until they’ve played through every question! Beautiful Graphics The design is sharp, modern and intuitive. Super-smooth animations bring the game to life! Transitions between screens show a slick sliding animation complete with easing. Say goodbye to standard fades/popping transitions. Quality Questions The quality of the questions in Ravenous Trivia is unrivalled.
