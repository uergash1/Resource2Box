That's right – put iPubquiz Hallowe'en on your iPhone and enjoy hair-raising, pub-quiz-type questions with a spooky theme. iPubquiz Hallowe'en is a spooktacular variation on the best-selling iPubquiz, which shot into the top ten on Apple's iTunes Games/Trivia category like a witch over the rooftops. Created by the innovative and trusted SunCat Software brand, iPubquiz Hallowe'en is unique and completely FREE! Yep, iPubquiz Hallowe'en is no trick – it's a treat, because you can download it today at NO COST. Graphics are frighteningly good and playing is as simple as bobbing for apples. Without water getting up your nose. And you can compete against other online zombie, spook and spectre fans on the global scoreboard. Just tap Play on your iPhone and get straight down to it. Which band released the album 'Monster' in 1994? Which was the first horror movie to win an Oscar for Best Picture? Choose correctly and you'll get 500 points in your trick or treat bag. There are points not just for correct answers, but also for speed. The higher your score, the higher the position you'll haunt on the iTunes scoreboard. Choose 50:50 or give up the ghost with a 'Pass' if you're struggling. Lose three lives and move into the next world. iPubquiz Hallowe'en has to be unique. Spicing up the traditional pub quiz with some seriously spooky content, it's a game with real spirit. Be quick, though – iPubquiz Hallowe'en is available for download only during October.</description><thumb cache="FW14-topics-docs/e048/7137_09_thumb.jpg">http://o3.aolcdn.com/games-scaler/proxy/79/86/1/o.aolcdn.com/games-scaler/proxy/172/188/1/a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/30/78/13/30781325-ed4b-659c-f103-2b61aa2c0196/mzl.juorlzya.100x100-75.jpg</thumb></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e048-7137-10"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e048/7137_10.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 10:44:12">http://www.games.com/game/tom-callaghan/ipubquiz-christmas-time-quiz</link><title>iPUBQUIZ - Christmas time Quiz</title><description>Christmas is fun. Pub quizzes are fun. Put them together and what have you got? That's right. More fun. But of course, Christmas is only fun up to a point. And that's the point about an hour after you've stuffed yourself to the eyeballs with turkey and dozed off in front of Her Maj. And that's where iPubquiz Merry Christmas merrily waltzes in. iPubquiz Merry Christmas is a seasonal variation on iPubquiz, which rocketed into the top ten on Apple's iTunes Games/Trivia category like Santa over the rooftops. Created by the innovative and trusted SunCat Software brand, iPubquiz Merry Christmas is completely FREE! Yep, just when your pockets are empty, we give you a phone-full of free festive fun. Play is as simple and intuitive as munching on a mince pie, and you can compete against other online players by entering your score onto the global scoreboard. Just tap Play on your iPhone and you're straight into the Crimbo-themed game. Which war provides the backdrop to the movie 'Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence'? Who teamed up with Tom Jones to record the '99 Christmas hit 'Baby, it's cold outside'? Choose the right response from the four answers and you'll bag 500 points in your Christmas sack. You'll be rewarded not just for correct answers, but also for speed of response. The more you score, the higher you go up the iTunes scoreboard. If you're struggling, you've got a choice of 50:50 or a Pass. But remember – you've got only three lives. You have three chances on each question and you'll lose points for wrong answers. But the game's only up if you make four wrong guesses. Then, guess what – you just start again. If you love pub quizzes as much as you love Christmas, you'll have a seriously merry time on iPubquiz Merry Christmas. It's the father of all Christmas pub-quiz apps. But be quick – iPubquiz Merry Christmas is available only during the festive season.</description><thumb cache="FW14-topics-docs/e048/7137_10_thumb.jpg">http://o1.aolcdn.com/games-scaler/proxy/79/86/1/o.aolcdn.com/games-scaler/proxy/172/188/1/a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/55/16/c2/5516c208-5fa1-951b-5610-42e818aae5c6/mzl.gruirowy.100x100-75.jpg</thumb></snippet></snippets></search_results>
