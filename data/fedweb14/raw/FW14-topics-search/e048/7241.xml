You can use it to practise aerobatics, have a lazy fly on a rainy day, or compete to fly as fast as possible in a number of races with online leaderboards (using Scoreloop). It includes 19 gliders, 2 powered (jet-type) aircraft, a powered trainer and four fully aerobatic propeller driven planes, and a quadcopter. It focusses particularly on simulating gliding flight - with realistic models of wind flow, turbulence and thermals. The sceneries include a variety of slope and flat field sites. Some are panoramic, with high graphical quality, but a fixed viewpoint. Others are 3D scenes where you can fly in or behind the plane. It is highly configurable, so you can create and explore new terrains from inside the app, as well as adjust settings such as the wind modelling, aeroplane settings (including size and ballast) etc. If you've never flown a radio-controlled plane before, you'll probably find it hard to fly at first. Check the support website for a video and hints on how to fly. PicaSim won't teach you how to fly, but it can help you learn - persevere and the sky is the limit! You can read a detailed review of PicaSim in the February 2013 edition of Radio Controlled Soaring Digest at www.rcsoaringdigest.com - "PicaSim is a fantastic flight simulator ... after a short time it’s like having a real transmitter in your hands". The support website provides some information on how to add your own planes and sceneries to the simulator - and has a link to a forum if you have any questions/suggestions etc.</description><thumb cache="FW14-topics-docs/e048/7241_06_thumb.jpg">http://o1.aolcdn.com/games-scaler/proxy/79/86/1/o.aolcdn.com/games-scaler/proxy/172/188/1/a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/11/95/71/119571b2-395a-391b-69e4-513cb153fb00/mzl.tfjbevnz.100x100-75.jpg</thumb></snippet><snippet id="FW14-e048-7241-07"><link cache="FW14-topics-docs/e048/7241_07.html" timestamp="2014-04-20 18:07:28">http://www.games.com/game/bottle-rocket/wings-free-flight-simulator</link><title>Wings Free: Flight Simulator</title><description>Wings Free has a single timed level.
