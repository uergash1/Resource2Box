Updating the game \- Your cars and money are saved on your device. DO NOT EVER uninstall the game before updating, or you will lose ALL of your stuff. 1\. Racing \- Launch and shift when the dashboard indicator turns blue or green \- If there is too much wheelspin, you are not going anywhere - watch the orange indicator on your dashboard \- Once you learn how to drive properly, ignore the lights and find your own winning strategy \- Nitrous is more effective on underpowered cars with lots of grip. Timing is crucial! 2\. Cars and upgrades \- Test drive before you buy a car! \- The more your car costs, the tougher opposition you'll face both offline and online \- Upgrades count towards increasing car cost/level, while tuning doesn't \- Keep your car cost just under your level cap to get an advantage \- Adjusting gear ratios (Garage -&gt; Upgrade -&gt; Tune) is costly, but lets you achieve times that are impossible on stock settings 3\. Game modes and winnings \- Race against beginner/amateur AI to get some quick cash and build your car \- Defeat bosses and unlock achievements for extra RP \- Go online and race against others to earn maximum cash/RP \- If your car isn't ready for online races, earn some cash in "Drivers Battle" \- For the ultimate challenge, race against top players in Pro League 4\.
