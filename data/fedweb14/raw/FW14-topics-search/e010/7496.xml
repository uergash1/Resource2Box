Using in situ hyperspectral measurements collected in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, we discriminate six species of conifer trees using a recent, nonparametric statistics technique known as penalized discriminant analysis (PDA). A classification accuracy of 76% is obtained. Our emphasis is on providing an intuitive, geometric description of PDA that makes the advantages of penalization clear.

Grounding systems are designed to guarantee personal security, protection of equipment, and continuity of power supply. Hence, engineers must compute the equivalent resistance of the system and the potential distribution on the earth surface when a fault condition occurs. While very crude approximations were available until the 1970s, several computer methods have been more recently proposed on the basis of ...
