Minas Gjoka, Maciej Kurant, Carter T. Butts, Athina Markopoulou

Our goal in this paper is to develop a practical framework for obtaining a uniform sample of users in an online social network (OSN) by crawling its social graph. Such a sample allows to estimate any user property and some topological properties as well. To this end, Ô¨Årst, we consider and compare several candidate crawling techniques. Two approaches that can ...

Suhrid Balakrishnan, Sumit Chopra

While latent factor models are built using ratings data, which is typically assumed static, the ability to incorporate different kinds of subsequent user feedback is an important asset. For instance, the user might want to provide additional information to the system in order to improve his personal recommendations. To this end, we examine a novel scheme for efficiently learning (or ...

Pari Delir Haghighi, Shonali Krishnaswamy

Recently due to major changes in the structure of electricity industry and the rising costs of power generation, many countries have realized the potential and benefits of smart metering systems and demand response programs in balancing between the supply and the demand. DR mechanisms are capable of controlling the user energy consumption according to load conditions and providing effective energy ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
