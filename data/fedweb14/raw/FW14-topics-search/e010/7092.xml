...riculturally used soils. such estimations of n2o fluxes are associated with a high degree of uncertainties. uncertainty of source strength estimates mainly results from local scale variability of known and unknown sources. it is not known how much uncertainty is due to unmeasured sources. for example, considerations of n2o fluxes from soils used...
