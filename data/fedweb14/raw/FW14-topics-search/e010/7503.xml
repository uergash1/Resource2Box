A general-purpose fuzzy logic inference engine for real-time control applications, designed and fabricated in a 1.1-Î¼m, 3.3-V, double-level-metal CMOS technology, is discussed. Up to 102 rules are processed in parallel with a single 688 K transistor device. Features include a dynamically reconfigurable and cascadable architecture, TTL-compatible host interface, laser-programmable redundancy, ...

We demonstrated that interleukin 1 (IL-1), a potent peptide mediator in immune and inflammatory responses, stimulates the synthesis of cAMP in a variety of IL-1-responsive cell targets. We also showed that cAMP analogs and cAMP-inducing agents can replace IL-1 in the induction of interleukin 2 receptors on lymphocytes as well as in phytohemagglutinin-induced murine ...

For cancer metastasis, tumor cells present in the circulation must first adhere to the endothelium. Integrins lymphocyte function-associated an- tigen (LFA) 1 and very late antigen 4 play a central role in leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and subsequent migration into tissues. The majority of tumor cells derived from solid cancers including colorectal cancer do not express suitable adhesion ...

The physicochemical properties and relationship of bone-resorbing activity and interleukin 1 (11.-1) produced by adult 1-cell leukemia (All,) cells and cell line were studied in vitro. The culture supernatant of AIL cell line, Ml2, and peripheral blood lymphocytes freshly obtained from ATL patients had both II,-1 activity detected by the stimulation of murine thymocyte-proliferative responses ...

Adjuvant arthritis (AA) is an experimental model for rheumatoid arthritis, and is induced most easily in inbred Lewis rats by an intradermal injection of heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Susceptivity to the arthritis in Lewis rats is thought to be related to a defect in their responses of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to ...
