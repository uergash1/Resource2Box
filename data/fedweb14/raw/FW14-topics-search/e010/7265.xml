Han Olff, Mark E. Ritchie

...role of herbivores in controlling plant species richness is a critical issue in the conservation and management of grassland biodiversity. numerous field experiments in grassland plant communities show that herbivores often, but not always, increase plant diversity. recent work suggests that...
