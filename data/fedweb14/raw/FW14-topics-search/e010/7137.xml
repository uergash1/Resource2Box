Action recognition is an important and challenging topic in computer vision, with many important applications in- cluding video surveillance, automated cinematography and understanding of social interaction. Yet, most current work in gesture or action interpretation remains rooted in view- dependent representations. This paper introduces Motion History Volumes (MHV) as a free-viewpoint representation for human actions in the case of ...</description></snippet></snippets></search_results>
