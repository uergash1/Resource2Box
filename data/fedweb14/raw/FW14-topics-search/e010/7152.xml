Jeremy Gibbons

Generic programming consists of increasing the expressive- ness of programs by allowing a wider variety of kinds of parameter than is usual. The most popular instance of this scheme is the C++ Standard Template Library. Datatype-generic programming is another instance, in which the parameters take the form of datatypes. We argue that datatype-generic programming is sucient to express ...

Stephanie Weirich, Liang Huang

Type-directed programming is an important and widely used paradigm in the design of soft- ware. With this form of programming, an application may analyze type information to deter- mine its behavior. By analyzing the structure of data, many operations, such as serialization, cloning, adaptors and iterators may be defined once, for all types of data. That way, as the ...

The Open Source mobility middleware developed in the Fuego Core project provides a stack for ecient XML processing on limited devices. Its components are a persistent map API, advanced XML serialization and out-of-order parsing with byte-level access (XAS ), data structures and algorithms for lazy manipulation and random access to XML trees (Ref- Tree), and a component for ...

We first describe set union data structures. Their discovery required a new,set of techniques and tools that have proved useful in other areas ...
