An Intern's Recap of LinkedIn Intern Hackday Karan Parikh August 27, 2012

Editor’s Note: LinkedIn hosted our second Intern Hackday in August. Karan Parikh, LinkedIn intern extraordinaire, is here to tell us about his experience.

Two weeks later, I was introduced to Philip Holsinger through a colleague in my office. Philip, a professional photojournalist, was in Chicago to photograph…

In his book on the 2008 financial crisis, RBC Wealth CEO John Taft conducted a brief meta-analysis, looking at who was being blamed for the financial crisis.
