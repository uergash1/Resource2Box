The order follows the  Augustinian  rule.           Contents       1   History   2   The Modern Order   3   Sources   4   External links               [ edit ]   History   The order arose in the city of  Mechlin , in the  Duchy of Brabant  (in central  Flanders , now  Belgium ), in the fifteenth century, during the terrible ravages of a  pandemic  called the  ""Black Death.""  Certain laymen united under the guidance of a man named Tobias to succor the plague-stricken, without taking any vows or adopting a rule of life. One of their most obvious actions being the burial of those who died from the plague; they were known as  ""Cellites""  (from Latin  cella , a cell and hence a grave). Later on, they chose as their patron  St. Alexius , a saint who served many years in a hospital at  Edessa  in  Syria ; and thenceforth they called themselves the Alexian Brothers.   They rapidly spread through-out  Germany ,  Brabant , Flanders, and other countries. They were also styled  ""Lollhorden""  (Old  German :  lollon ), meaning  ""to sing softly,""  from their chants for the dead. As a result they were sometimes confused with the  Lollards , a  Wyclifian   sect  of  heretics . They did not escape calumny and persecution, as demonstrated from the  Papal Bull   ""Ad Audientiam Nostram""  ( 2 December   1377 ) which  Pope Gregory XI  sent to the German bishops, especially those of  Cologne ,  Trier  and  Mainz , forbidding annoyance of the  ""Cellites""  and enjoining punishment for their persecutors. This was followed by Bulls of a similar tenor from  Pope Boniface IX  on  7 January   1396 ,  Pope Eugene IV  on  12 May   1431 ,  Pope Nicholas V  and  Pope Pius II .   In 1469, the mother-house at  Aix-la-Chapelle  voiced the general feeling of the Brothers in asking the  Louis de Bourbon, prince-bishop of Lige  to raise that house to a convent of the  Order of St. Augustine . The request was granted, and Father Dominicus Brock and five of the Brothers took the solemn vows of religious. This step and the revised constitution of the Order were confirmed by  Blessed Pius IX  on  12 September   1870 .   In the early 20th century the Alexian Brothers had four hospitals in the United States. The first was built in  Chicago  in the year 1866; it was destroyed by the  Great Fire , on  9 October   1871 , and rebuilt the following year. The second, erected at  St Louis  in 1869, covers an acre with its departments for the insane, nervous diseases, and inebriates. The third is in  Oshkosh, Wisconsin  and built in the year 1880. The fourth was built in  Elizabeth, N.J. , on land given for that purpose by Right Rev. Bishop Wigger. Competent surgeons and physicians attend to the patients, and the Brothers nurse and do the housework of the hospitals.   Bishop  Herbert Vaughan  of  Salford ,  England  (later, Cardinal), invited the Alexian Brothers to take charge of a new home and hospital in his diocese, which led to their establishing themselves in England in June 1875. Dr Richard Lacy,  Bishop of Middlesbrough , secured them for his diocese in 1884. In 1885, the Brothers established a Province of their Order and a novitiate in the  United Kingdom . The latter, first attached to St. Mary's Convent,  Newton Heath ,  Manchester , was later transferred to  Twyford Abbey , near  Ealing , which the Alexian Brothers had purchased.     [ edit ]   The Modern Order   The American branch of the order provide services in acute care, residential elderly care, retirement centers, and AIDS ministry in  Illinois ,  Missouri ,  Wisconsin ,  Tennessee ,  Chicago , and also outside the USA in the  Philippines  and  Hungary .   The contemporary British and Irish establishments in  London ,  Manchester ,  Dublin  and  Limerick  include facilities for the elderly sick and physically handicapped through a nursing home and Day Centre; an AIDS ministry; care and rehabilitation of homeless men; and support for people suffering from mental illness.   On the European continent the contemporary German branch of the order has houses in  Aachen ,  Krefeld ,  Malseneck ,  Mnster  and  Twistringen . In Belgium they have centres in  Boechout ,  Tienen ,  Grimbergen  and Henri-Chapelle where they provide psychiatric services.

Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (January 2009)       The trademarked term  purpose driven  comes from the teaching of  Rick Warren , senior pastor of  Saddleback Church  in Lake Forest, California. It originally came into use as a  paradigm  taught to pastors and other  Christian  leaders worldwide to help them be more effective in leading their churches. This teaching is embodied in Warrens best-selling book,  The Purpose Driven Church , first published in 1995. [ 1 ]   The basic premise of the Purpose Driven paradigm is for a pastor to recognize and be obedient to Gods  purposes  for his people and his  church  and organize around developing these characteristics into the lives of people within his care. In Christian terms, this is the task of  making  disciples . An additional focus is how to be most effective in reaching out to share Gods love and  forgiveness  in the local community and with non-believers who visit the church. In Christian terms, this is the task of  evangelism . To be purpose driven is to be driven by Gods purposes, not our own. [ 1 ]   These purposes, according to Warrens teaching, are found in two verses in the  New Testament  book of  Matthew . These two passages, located in Matthew chapters 22 and 28, are often referred to by Christians worldwide as the  Great Commandment  and the  Great Commission . From these verses, Warren identified five purposes: worship, ministry, mission, fellowship, and discipleship. [ 1 ]         Love the Lord your God with all your heart  and with all your soul and with all your mind... Love your neighbor as yourself . All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.  Matthew 22:3740 (NIV)   Worship   Love the Lord your God with all your heart       Ministry   Love your neighbor as yourself                Go and make disciples  of all nations,  baptizing them  in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and  teaching them to obey  everything I have commanded you.  Matthew 28:1920 (NIV)   Mission   Go and make disciples       Fellowship   baptizing them       Discipleship   teaching them to obey        In 2002, Warren wrote  The Purpose Driven Life  as a 40-day devotional book. [ 2 ]  This has become an international best seller, with over 30 million copies in print by 2006. [ 3 ]  This book took the same five purposes and focused on the life of the individual Christian. The book starts out with the words, "" Its not about you,  meaning the life that God created us to live is one driven by his purposes, not our own desires. [ 2 ]   The tenets of the Purpose Driven paradigm have been taught to hundreds of thousands of Christian leaders worldwide through conferences and seminars, with many pastors adopting the principles in their churches. While there is no formal Purpose Driven organization  this activity being an outreach of Saddleback Church  there is an informal worldwide  network  of churches that work together to train other leaders, publish training resources in local languages, and collaborate on evangelistic and social action activities. This latter activity of evangelism and social action has developed into a strategy called The  P.E.A.C.E. Plan , in which many of these same churches also are involved.   The Purpose Driven paradigm is a set of principles and processes based on an understanding of the biblical purposes for the church. Implementing this paradigm enables the church leader to be most effective in reaching out to people in love, welcoming them into the fellowship of the local church, encouraging and training them for Christ-like behavior, and equipping them for volunteer service within the church  all as an expression of their worship to God. Simply put, the Purpose Driven paradigm encourages the Christian leader to maintain an intentional,  strategic , and balanced focus on all five purposes, which will in turn produce church health. The concept focuses on health, with the conviction that growth will take care of itself when a congregation is healthy. The paradigm is being utilized by churches in many denominations and theological expressions across many cultures worldwide.

It was first published in 1995. It is subtitled, "" Growth Without Compromising Your Message & Mission ."" In a May 2005 survey of American pastors and ministers conducted by  George Barna ,  [ 1 ]   The Purpose Driven Church  was voted as the second book most influential on their lives and ministries, behind  The Purpose Driven Life , a subsequent book by Rick Warren.   The book is targeted to pastors and church leaders and advises them to base their ministry on God's purposes, not their own ideas of ministry, hence the term "" Purpose Driven "". Warren suggests that these purposes are  Worship ,  Fellowship ,  Discipleship ,  Ministry  and  Mission  and that they are derived from the  Great Commandment  ( Matthew 22:37-40 ) and the  Great Commission  ( Matthew 28:19-20 ).   Warren writes that every church is driven by something. Tradition, finances, programs, personalities, events, seekers and even buildings can each be the controlling force in a church. But he believes that in order for a church to be healthy it must built around the five  New Testament  purposes given to the church by  Jesus . ""The issue is church health, not  church growth !"" declares Warren. ""If your church is healthy, growth will occur naturally. Healthy, consistent growth is the result of balancing the five  biblical  purposes of the church.""   He proposes that church leaders ask of themselves, ""What is our purpose?"", ""Why do we do what we do?"", ""What should we be doing?"", and ""How will you do that?"". In this book Warren provides a guide to answer these questions on how to do church. He further suggests that following the principles he outlines in the book will enable a church to grow         Warmer through fellowship   Deeper through discipleship   Stronger through worship   Broader through ministry, and   Larger through evangelism.         The author emphasizes an intentional people-building process. He says, If you will concentrate on building people, God will build the church.   The teaching of  The Purpose Driven Church  was derived from Warren's own experience in leading  Saddleback Church  from its founding in 1980 to over 10,000 in worship attendance in its first fifteen years, becoming one of the fastest growing churches in America during this time.  [ 2 ]   The  Purpose Driven Church  has been translated into over 30 languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German. It is listed in  100 Christian Books That Changed the Century   [ 3 ]  and has been given many awards. For example, in 1996 and 1997, the book was the  Evangelical Christian Publishers Association  (ECPA)  Christian Book Award Winner  for the US. In 2002, the ECPA awarded it the Gold Medallion Award. [ 4 ]  The book and its author has received numerous reviews in the mainstream press and has been the subject of much support and criticism in Christian blogs and newsletters. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  In 2005, Time magazine called Rick Warren ""America's pastor.""

He has been invited to speak at the United Nations, the World Economic Forum in Davos, the African Union, the Council on Foreign Relations, Harvards Kennedy School of Government, TIMEs Global Health Summit, and numerous congresses around the world. TIME magazine named him one of 15 World Leaders Who Mattered Most in 2004 and in 2005 one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. Also, in 2005 U.S. News & World Report named him one of  Americas 25 Best Leaders.    As a theologian , Dr. Warren has lectured at Oxford, Cambridge, the University of Judaism, the Evangelical Theological Society, and numerous seminaries and universities.

One such person was  Sedrick , a gay man, who was struggling with his finances. Rev. Ed Bacon, an Episcopal priest and one of the spiritual advisors, addressed the young mans lack of self worth by saying that,  being gay is a gift from God , Minister Bernard Beckwith, another advisor, assured Sedrick that &he is the image and likeness of God just the as he is.   Oprah asked Sedrick if he believed being gay is a gift from God. Sedrick said that he hadnt thought that way before but that after talking with the spiritual leaders on the program, I think Im going to leave here with a renewed vision.  So Im getting it.  Unfortunately, the Oprah show website left out this important personal revelation out of the episode recap on the website.   Rev. Ed Bacon   Rev. Bacon is rector of  All Saints Episcopal Church  in Pasadena, California, where the Rev.  Susan Russell  serves as senior associate rector and is the president of Integrity, the national Episcopal LGBT advocacy group. Take a look at her  blog to read moving letters from people who saw the Oprah show . Dr. Beckwith is the founder and spiritual director of  Agape International Spiritual Center in Los Angeles  which  is an LGBT-affirming congregation .   The response was so massive that Oprah did a follow-up segment with Rev. Bacon on January 12. Oprah asked Rev. Bacon, So do people call you or were they only just calling me?       Rev. Bacon  said, Oh no my friend. My email was full of content and from what I gather, it simply unleashed a flood of healing throughout the country, and Australia, and Great Britain across the continent. It was amazing that people were talking about their hearts being healed and their hearts leaping. Two or three people said I am weeping while I am writing you this email. It was amazing and most of the email and voice maillike 30 to onewas appreciative that being gay is a gift from God.   Take  action!  Please  write to Oprah  and thank her for including LGBT-inclusive faith voices on her show. Share your story about how Rev. Bacons comments affected you, both in your email and in the comments below.            Related Posts:              Statement by GLAAD President on the Rev.

Giuliano, made a  statement  about the selection of the Rt. Reverend V. Gene Robinson to deliver the invocation at the opening celebration of the Presidential Inauguration:   President-elect Obama has made an excellent choice with the selection of Rev. Gene Robinson, and the broadcast will allow millions of people worldwide to participate in this historic event.     Rev. Robinson represents an incredible voice who has made great strides toward encouraging LGBT inclusion in faith communities. By featuring an openly gay faith leader, Obama is sending a strong message about the importance of truly inclusive faith voices that can move us away from exclusion and division and toward the common ground we share.

It was not long ago that President-elect Obama faced heavy criticism from LGBT advocacy groups and leaders for his selection of conservative evangelist  Rick Warren  to give the inaugural invocation.  GLAAD issued  a statement, and also published clips of Warrens previous media statements on LGBT issues.   Obama defended his choice as part of his commitment to diverse voices at his inauguration, and pointed to the closing prayer invitation of straight ally,  The Reverend Joseph Lowery , a United Methodist and veteran Civil Rights activist. Lowery is a signer on the Methodist statement of  People of Color for an All Inclusive Church .    Robinsons prayer at an opening inaugural event in front of the Lincoln Memorial is a powerful reminder of this countrys efforts to move toward freedom and equality for all. Change is possible.   When Bishop Robinson was interviewed by the  Seattle Post-Intelligencer   recently, he reflected on church support of his ministry and said, There is great excitement in my heart to be living in a time when the  church is starting to get it right . We can only imagine that he may have been thinking that the country is starting to get it right, too.

Rick Warren  to give the prayer of invocation at his inauguration.  Obama’s hopeful statements of support for the LGBT community made the invitation to Warren that much more shocking.  Bloggers and our collected  media clips  show that Warren has a long history of using his platform to perpetuate anti-gay stances.   Box Turtle  states:   “Rick Warren claims he’s not a homophobe because he has “many gay friends” and has “eaten dinner in gay homes.”  And yet, he still believes that his friends’ relationships are no different morally from  child rape, incest or polygamy .   As the pastor of Saddleback mega-church (the fourth-largest church in the United States) he and his wife spent millions on global HIV/AIDS ministries. Conservatives criticize him for taking such a “liberal” stance on the HIV/AIDS issue, but he  continues to equate  same-sex marriage with incest and polygamy.   On Father’s Day this year, Warren met was persuaded to meet with the gay-affirming organization Soulforce, where  he argued  that gay people had to be celibate if they want to serve the church.   Saddleback Church drew global media attention as the venue for a presidential debate on values, which Warren followed up by using his media influence to speak against marriage for same-sex marriage. He was instrumental in building support for the passage of Proposition 8, which banned marriage for gay couples.   Today, President-elect Obama  responded at a live press conference  with carefully crafted  talking points  by saying that Warren had invited him to Saddleback in spite of their differing views on many topics and now he has invited Warren to be part of America’s “noisy conversation” of divergent opinions.  Obama pointed to the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery as the minister who will give the benediction and has  vastly different  view on gay issues.   Recently, Warren  said in an interview  over at Beliefnet that he believes in full equality:   Beliefnet: Do you support civil unions or domestic partnerships?   Warren: I don’t know if I’d use the term there but I support full equal rights for everybody in America. I don’t believe we should have unequal rights depending on particular lifestyles so I fully support equal rights.   Beliefnet: What about partnership benefits in terms of insurance or hospital visitation?   Warren: You know, not a problem with me.   GLAAD has already urged  the media ask incisive questions about what equality means in relation to employment, housing and protection from hate crimes.  We challenge them to hold both Rick Warren and President-Elect Obama accountable and clarify what  “equality” truly means to them.

LA Times reports on Warrens Christmas Eve sermon     Brad Greenberg  | December 31, 2008    So its come to this for the Rev. Rick Warren, and the once exceptional  Los Angeles Times : Southern Californias waning news leader, which today  devoted two inches to the butchering  of 189 Congo villagers, assigned not one but two reporters to find out what Warren was going to preach about on Christmas Eve. It  wasnt that interesting :            Warren told the 3,100 people who packed the churchs cavernous worship center about some plans that had not turned out as anticipated. President-elect Obamas plans for a noncontroversial inaugurationright out the door, he said, drawing a round of applause from the congregation.        The prominent minister also delivered a sobering message for Christmas.        You may be going through a change in plans right now, he said. You hadnt expected to be laid off or to be financially tight right now. And when that happens, youre asking, Why me, why now?        Jesus said you dont understand now what I am doing, but you will understand later. Thats the . . . thing you have to learn when God changes your plan. You have to learn to trust him.       The article goes on to mention what Warren said the previous weekend at the annual conference of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which I  reported on last Tuesday .    I know the pastorthe author of The Purpose-Driven Life and a rising voice in politics, evangelical and beyondgenerated controversy when President-elect Barack Obama asked him to say the prayer at the Jan. 20 inauguration, and I know that the media is still suffering from its  Jeremiah Wright hangover  and the  absence  of  Sarah Palin , but Warren isnt Wright and Obamas selection  really wasnt as surprising  as some want to portray it.

Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 31, 2008   |  Comments (0)        Franklin Graham: Obama/Warren Criticisms Ludicrous      | December 23, 2008    Evangelist Franklin Graham knows a thing or two about getting flack for praying at an inauguration. He took heat after praying in Jesus's name at President Bush's inauguration in 2001. I just  spoke with Franklin Graham , who gave his take on Obama's decision to ask megachurch pastor Rick Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration. We have also compiled our coverage of Warren over the years in a  special section .    Here are some highlights from the interview:       [Obama] is including evangelicals at his inauguration, but I don't know if he'll include them in his administration. Time will tell. But Rick Warren will have Obama's ear on important issues.        Does Warren's acceptance of the invitation give an implicit nod to Obama's administration?       For anybody to be upset at Rick Warren for offering a prayer to almighty God, asking God to give wisdom and guidance to the Obama administration, is ludicrous.        Should Rick Warren pray in the name of Jesus at the inaugural?       I would hope he does because he's a minister of the gospel. There's no other way to pray. A Muslim should not be offended. [Warren] has no other way to pray than in the name of Christ. No one should be offended, because Rick Warren should be who Rick Warren is, and that's a minister of Jesus Christ.        I know you  said a month ago  that your father would not be serving as a spiritual adviser to Barack Obama.       He's 90 years old. He's just happy to get up in the morning.        Do you have any advice for Rick Warren?       My advice to Rick is to stay true to your convictions, and don't back up one step. I don't think he will. When you have the far left and the gay advocates mad at you, you must be doing something right.          Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 23, 2008   |  Comments (18)        Pastor to the President     Mark Silk  | December 22, 2008    Once upon a time, presidents tended to choose their own pastors, or reasonable facsimiles thereof, to give the invocation at their inaugurations. The idea was: Here's the guy who presides over my religious life, the guy I go to for spiritual counsel, and so I'm going to honor him by letting him say the prayer over this latest ceremonial occasion of my life. Thus, John F. Kennedy gave the nod to Boston's Cardinal Richard Cushing in 1961 and, in 1981, Ronald Reagan tapped Bel Air Presbyterian pastor Donn Moomaw. From time to time, the invoking cleric would be chosen for symbolic reasons, as when Dwight Eisenhower selected Orthodox Archbishop Michael in 1957 and Reagan, in 1985, chose the president of Georgetown University, Father Joseph A. O'Hare S.J.    But over the past two decades, it appears that a new office has emerged--that of Pastor to the President. This emergence is a bit obscured by the fact that the only actual holder of that office has been Billy Graham. Graham gave the invocations at the inauguration of George H.W. Bush and both Clinton inaugurals, and was slated to do the same at George W. Bush's 2001 affair, but because of illness had to cede the job to his son Franklin. It is, I think, in this context that Barack Obama's choice of Rick Warren needs to be seen. As has been widely noted, Warren bids fair to become the closest thing to Billy Graham that the country has today. At the moment, he's way more controversial than the now sainted Graham, but in his younger days, Billy was plenty controversial himself.    What's important to recognize is that the position of presidential pastor is not entirely bogus. It entails spiritual counseling, advice and friendship, pastoral care. Graham actually seems to have filled that role for Richard Nixon, which helps explain why Nixon tapped him for his first inaugural invocation. The Clintons are both attached to him; according to Burns Strider, who handled faith outreach for the Hillary Clinton campaign, whenever Hillary was slated to make an appearance in North Carolina, she insisted on paying a call on the old man. And of course, George W. Bush has made central to his faith journey that walk on the beach with Billy. Even if that particular event is, strictly speaking, apocryphal, the personal connection seems real.    Rick Warren is of course the head of the Saddleback world, the crusader for AIDS, the best-selling author of popular religious books. But he also, from what I gather, has taken it upon himself to serve as spiritual counselor to the politically prominent. There is every indication that Obama has availed himself of his services. Amidst all the huffing and puffing about Warren's choice to give next month's invocation, hardly raised at all is the possibility that this was, for Obama, as much a personal as a political decision. His family is, famously, between churches, and his relationship with Jeremiah Wright can hardly be what it once was. Warren seems to have given the president-elect good reason to like him and value his advice; the two call each other friend. We may think whatever we want of either, but this may be more about them than us.    Update: In support of this view of Warren, here's an exchange with Steve Waldman from a  recent interview :        Did you ever talk to President Bush to try to convince him to change his policy?        No. No.        Why not?         Never got the chance. I just didnt. In fact, in the first place, Im a pastor, and people might misunderstand  I dont deal with policy issues with Barack Obama or President Clinton or John McCain. I just dont. Thats not my role. My role is to pastor these guys. As a leader I understand stress.        And even when I disagree with positions they hold, theyve got plenty of political advisors. They dont need me to be a political advisor. Im not a pundit. Im not a politician and thats why I dont take sides. But I am a pastor. And I can deal with hows your family doing? Hows your stress level doing?     (Originally published at  Spiritual Politics .)       Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 22, 2008   |  Comments (0)        How Should Warren Then Pray?      | December 18, 2008    California megachurch pastor Rick Warren will be preaching at 16 Christmas services and was not available for an interview with  Christianity Today . However, he sent us a statement about his decision to pray at Barack Obama's inauguration, in response to the  criticism Obama has received  for inviting Warren.       ""I commend President-elect Obama for his courage to willingly take enormous heat from his base by inviting someone like me, with whom he doesnt agree on every issue, to offer the Invocation at his historic Inaugural ceremony.    Hopefully individuals passionately expressing opinions from the left and the right will recognize that both of us have shown a commitment to model civility in America.    The Bible admonishes us to pray for our leaders. I am honored by this opportunity to pray Gods blessing on the office of the President and its current and future inhabitant, asking the Lord to provide wisdom to Americas leaders during this critical time in our nations history.""       Obama's pick also begs the question that  David Waters asks  in the  Washington Post 's On Faith section: ""To Whose God Will Rick Warren Pray?""        Billy Graham used inclusive language when he delivered the Inaugural Invocation in 1989. ""0 God, we consecrate today George Herbert Walker Bush to the presidency of these United States,"" he said. But four years later, Graham ended his invocation at Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration this way: I pray this in the name of the one that's called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, the Everlasting Father and the Prince of Peace. Amen.""       Waters also reminds readers that in 2001, Franklin Graham ended his invocation with, ""in the name of the father, and of the son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit."" And Kirbyjon Caldwell ended with, ""'We respectfully submit this humble prayer in the name that's above all other names, Jesus the Christ.""    At the DNC,  Blue Like Jazz  author Donald Miller  ended his prayer  with ""I make these requests in the name of your son, Jesus, who gave his own life against the forces of injustice,"" putting a slight emphasis on I. Florida megachurch pastor Joel Hunter took a more unconventional approach during  his benediction .        Now I interrupt this prayer for a closing instruction. I want to personalize this. I want this to be a participatory prayer. And so therefore, because we are in a country that is still welcoming all faiths, I would like all of us to close this prayer in the way your faith tradition would close your prayer.  So on the count of three, I want all of you to end this prayer, your prayer, the way you usually end prayer. You ready? One, two, three.  In Jesus' name, Amen.  Let's go change the world for good.       Waters also asks another question: ""Does it matter?"" What do you think?       Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 18, 2008   |  Comments (6)        Obama Defends Rick Warren's Inaugural Invocation Plans      |     Barack Obama defended  his choice  of California megapastor Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at next month's Inauguration, responding to  severe outcry  from gay rights advocates and  liberals .    ""I am a fierce advocate of equality for gay and lesbian Americans. It is something that I have been consistent on and something that I intend to continue to be consistent on in my presidency,""  Obama said  at a news conference this morning. ""What I've also said is that it is important for American to come together even though we may have disagreements on certain social issues.""    Gay rights advocates angrily denounced Obama's choice of Warren, who is an opponent of abortion rights and same-sex marriage.    Your invitation to Reverend Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at your inauguration is a genuine blow to LGBT Americans, the president of Human Rights Campaign, Joe Solomonese,  wrote to Obama yesterday . [W]e feel a deep level of disrespect when one of architects and promoters of an anti-gay agenda is given the prominence and the pulpit of your historic nomination.""    To my knowledge, these groups didn't make a fuss when Florida megachurch pastor Joel Hunter, who also opposes abortion and same-sex marriage,  prayed with Obama  on Election Day and  prayed at the Democratic National Convention . However, these groups are  still stinging  from California's decision to ban gay marriage, which Warren vocally supported.         Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 18, 2008   |  Comments (30)        Rick Warren to Give Invocation at Obama Inauguration      | December 17, 2008    Rick Warren, senior pastor at Saddleback Church,  will give the invocation  at Barack Obamas inaugural swearing-in ceremony on January 20.    The benediction will be given by Rev. Dr. Joseph E. Lowery, dean of the civil rights movement and co-founder with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.    Obama will be the first president since Harry Truman not to have a close relationship with evangelist Billy Graham. Franklin Graham  told CT last month  that although his father is praying for and would like to meet Obama, his role as counselor is ending. Could Rick Warren fill that role?       Posted by Sarah Pulliam at  December 17, 2008   |  Comments (16)        Rick Warren's Dark Night of the Soul     Steve Waldman  | December 15, 2008       Rick Warren is keeping a list, and checking it often.  He'll have to memorize it because he can't count on having his Blackberry when he needs this list most.  This is Rick Warren's list of questions for God.    In the course of a fascinating conversation last week with Beliefnet and our partner The Wall Street Journal -- click  here for video  of the full interview and  here for a transcript   -- Warren was stunningly candid about having doubts, even "" dark nights of the soul.""     ""Oh absolutely. All the time.""   ""What do you mean 'all the time'?""    ""I've never doubted God. But I've doubted why God does certain things...."".    There are parts of the Bible, for instance, that he doesn't get -- ""slaughters in the Bible and rules that don't seem to make sense and things that just don't seem to me, to be logical.""     ""And I still have doubts, I mean, I read the Bible and go 'whoa, why did God say that?'""    He concludes that these passages are mystifying because he just doesn't have ""the brain capacity"" to understand God -- but he is eager to ask Him a few questions at the appropriate moment.    One is why He gave humans the ability to have babies before they're ready to raise them.  He also wants to know how prayer works - why God answers some prayers right away and not others. ""The truth is, that the vast majority of our prayers, we don't see those kinds of miracles.""    But his number one question, he says, is about suffering:  ""I know why there's evil in the world, I don't understand why so much suffering happens to so many innocent people.""    I don't want to give the impression Warren has lost faith.  Quite the opposite.  Most of our talk was devoted to his absolute conviction that the real ""purpose of Christmas"" is understanding, treasuring and opening the gift of grace - the idea that Jesus said In effect, ""I've paid for everything you need to get into Heaven. I've paid your ticket..... That's the gift.""  ( Watch him talk about ""the gift"")    He offered an inspiring message about the  purpose of Christmas  (the topic of  his new book ) and some special devotionals for Beliefnet viewers.    He also dove headlong into some of the most controversial culture war issues, in ways likely to surprise and perhaps enrage some on the left and right.    Most Likely to Infuriate Liberals :                        Gay marriage is morally equivalent to allowing brothers and sisters to marry.   Watch.                       He opposes torture but didn't try to convince President Bush to change course because ""I never had the opportunity.""   Watch .                     A possibly veiled slap at Islam: ""He could have made us all puppets. ... He could have put us on strings and we'd pray five times a day and we'd have no choice.""   Watch .                      ""Abortion reduction"" efforts are  mostly a ""charade.""   Watch .                     His historical argument that ""social gospel"" Protestantism was ""just Marxism in Christian clothing"" and that ""the mainline [Protestants] died.""   Watch .       Most Likely to Infuriate Conservatives:                        He supports partnership rights for gays including insurance and visitation benefits. This appears to be a similar position to that which just prompted the resignation of a top official of the National Association of Evangelicals.   Watch .                     His declaration that it's a ""no brainer"" that divorce is a bigger threat to the American family than gay marriage, and that Christian leaders focus on gay marriage instead because ""we always love to talk about other people's sins.""   Watch .                       Religious conservatives have misled people into thinking Christ's message was primarily about conservative politics and that politics is the primary way to change culture.   Watch .                       The Bush administration seems to have engaged in torture, which he condemned.   Watch .                       While condemning abortion as a Holocaust and abortion reduction as a ""charade"" he nonetheless said he would support those efforts, which he equated to Schindler's list -- a way of reducing the harm of an overall evil.   Watch .       Most Likely to Titillate Theologians:                        While your behavior doesn't determine whether you get into heaven, it does determine what you do once you're there.   Watch .                     His statement that ""I really don't know"" whether people who don't know about Christ will be blocked entry into heaven.   Watch .                     ""God's will is not done most of the time on earth. When people go, 'oh, that hurricane must have been God's will' - baloney!""   Watch .       Most Likely to Inspire and Challenge:                        The story of his daughter in law's brain tumor and its surprising lesson the family learned.  Watch .                     His relentless commitment to awakening Americans to African poverty.   Watch .                     His personal Christmas prayer.    Watch .                     His argument that the economic collapse comes from abandoning Biblical principles of thrift.  Watch .       Moment I'd Most Like To Follow Up About:     Everyone will have their favorites. But for me the most interesting moment was after he described the gift of grace, and I then asked:  ""Why if he forgives us for murdering or raping would he not forgive us for not believing in Him?""  He took his best shot, but I'm not sure he totally nailed it.   Watch .    Click  here to buy Rick Warren's new book, The Purpose of Christmas .

clueweb09-enwp01-48-07501	"                     National Statement on Religious Diversity          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  National Statement on Religious Diversity  is a result of the  New Zealand Diversity Action Programme , and is intended to provide  a framework for the recognition of  New Zealand 's diverse faith communities and their harmonious interaction with each other, with government and with other groups in society.           Contents       1   Content   2   Background   3   Government ratification   4   Controversy   5   References               [ edit ]   Content   Preamble:  New Zealand is a country of many faiths with a significant minority who profess no religion. Increasing religious diversity is a significant feature of public life.   At the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, Governor Hobson affirmed, in response to a question from Catholic Bishop Pompallier, ""the several faiths (beliefs) of England, of the Wesleyans, of Rome, and also Maori custom shall alike be protected"". This foundation creates the opportunity to reaffirm an acknowledgement of the diversity of beliefs in New Zealand.   Christianity has played and continues to play a formative role in the development of New Zealand in terms of the nation's identity, culture, beliefs, institutions and values.   New settlers have always been religiously diverse, but only recently have the numbers of some of their faith communities grown significantly as a result of migration from Asia, Africa and the Middle East. These communities have a positive role to play in our society. It is in this context that we recognise the right to religion and the responsibilities of religious communities.   International treaties including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights uphold the right to freedom of religion and belief - the right to hold a belief; the right to change one's religion or belief; the right to express one's religion or belief; and the right not to hold a belief. These rights are reflected in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and Human Rights Act. The right to religion entails affording this right to others and not infringing their human rights.   The following statement provides a framework for the recognition of New Zealand's diverse faith communities and their harmonious interaction with each other, with government and with other groups in society:   1. The State and Religion     The State seeks to treat all faith communities and those who profess no religion equally before the law. New Zealand has no official or established religion.     2. The Right to Religion     New Zealand upholds the right to freedom of religion and belief and the right to freedom from discrimination on the grounds of religious or other belief.     3. The Right to Safety     Faith communities and their members have a right to safety and security.     4. The Right of Freedom of Expression     The right to freedom of expression and freedom of the media are vital for democracy but should be exercised with responsibility.     5. Recognition and Accommodation     Reasonable steps should be taken in educational and work environments and in the delivery of public services to recognise and accommodate diverse religious beliefs and practices.     6. Education     Schools should teach an understanding of different religious and spiritual traditions in a manner that reflects the diversity of their national and local community.     7. Religious Differences     Debate and disagreement about religious beliefs will occur but must be exercised within the rule of law and without resort to violence.     8. Cooperation and understanding     Government and faith communities have a responsibility to build and maintain positive relationships with each other, and to promote mutual respect and understanding.       [ edit ]   Background   The statement was prepared by the  Victoria University   Religious Studies  Programme and authored by Programme Director  Professor Paul Morris . The statement was the subject of a national process of public consultation coordinated by the  Human Rights Commission , and was endorsed by the National Interfaith Forum in  Hamilton  in February 2007 as a basis for ongoing public discussion.     [ edit ]   Government ratification   Prime Minister   Helen Clark  presented the statement to the third  Asia-Pacific Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation  to be held at  Waitangi  from May 29-31, 2007.     [ edit ]   Controversy   The Statement has caused some controversy over its first clause, which states that ""New Zealand has no official or established religion."" Opponents of the statement argue New Zealand's head of state  Queen Elizabeth II  is the supreme governor of the  Church of England  (although not in Her Majesty's capacity as Queen of New Zealand).  Brian Tamaki , a Bishop of the  Destiny Church  stated: ""That [Christianity] is the chosen religion of the Head of the Commonwealth. For us to depart from that, don't you think that that is bordering on creating some type of treason, religious treason anyhow?"" [ 1 ] . However, a poll of 501 New Zealanders by  Research New Zealand  in June 2007 found that 58% of respondents did not think Christianity should be New Zealand's official religion  [ 2 ] .   Another source of controversy has been the fact that the composition of the working group managing the formulation of the National Statement and its endorsement was limited to representatives of religious groups. Consequently, while extending some rights to non-religious people the Statement did omit to extend the right of safety (clause 4). This has led to some criticism from representatives of non-religious beliefs.     [ edit ]   References       ^   Collins, Simon.

Contents       1   History   2   The Modern Order   3   Sources   4   External links               [ edit ]   History   The order arose in the city of  Mechlin , in the  Duchy of Brabant  (in central  Flanders , now  Belgium ), in the fifteenth century, during the terrible ravages of a  pandemic  called the  ""Black Death.""  Certain laymen united under the guidance of a man named Tobias to succor the plague-stricken, without taking any vows or adopting a rule of life. One of their most obvious actions being the burial of those who died from the plague; they were known as  ""Cellites""  (from Latin  cella , a cell and hence a grave). Later on, they chose as their patron  St. Alexius , a saint who served many years in a hospital at  Edessa  in  Syria ; and thenceforth they called themselves the Alexian Brothers.   They rapidly spread through-out  Germany ,  Brabant , Flanders, and other countries. They were also styled  ""Lollhorden""  (Old  German :  lollon ), meaning  ""to sing softly,""  from their chants for the dead. As a result they were sometimes confused with the  Lollards , a  Wyclifian   sect  of  heretics . They did not escape calumny and persecution, as demonstrated from the  Papal Bull   ""Ad Audientiam Nostram""  ( 2 December   1377 ) which  Pope Gregory XI  sent to the German bishops, especially those of  Cologne ,  Trier  and  Mainz , forbidding annoyance of the  ""Cellites""  and enjoining punishment for their persecutors. This was followed by Bulls of a similar tenor from  Pope Boniface IX  on  7 January   1396 ,  Pope Eugene IV  on  12 May   1431 ,  Pope Nicholas V  and  Pope Pius II .   In 1469, the mother-house at  Aix-la-Chapelle  voiced the general feeling of the Brothers in asking the  Louis de Bourbon, prince-bishop of Lige  to raise that house to a convent of the  Order of St. Augustine . The request was granted, and Father Dominicus Brock and five of the Brothers took the solemn vows of religious. This step and the revised constitution of the Order were confirmed by  Blessed Pius IX  on  12 September   1870 .   In the early 20th century the Alexian Brothers had four hospitals in the United States. The first was built in  Chicago  in the year 1866; it was destroyed by the  Great Fire , on  9 October   1871 , and rebuilt the following year. The second, erected at  St Louis  in 1869, covers an acre with its departments for the insane, nervous diseases, and inebriates. The third is in  Oshkosh, Wisconsin  and built in the year 1880. The fourth was built in  Elizabeth, N.J. , on land given for that purpose by Right Rev. Bishop Wigger. Competent surgeons and physicians attend to the patients, and the Brothers nurse and do the housework of the hospitals.   Bishop  Herbert Vaughan  of  Salford ,  England  (later, Cardinal), invited the Alexian Brothers to take charge of a new home and hospital in his diocese, which led to their establishing themselves in England in June 1875. Dr Richard Lacy,  Bishop of Middlesbrough , secured them for his diocese in 1884. In 1885, the Brothers established a Province of their Order and a novitiate in the  United Kingdom . The latter, first attached to St. Mary's Convent,  Newton Heath ,  Manchester , was later transferred to  Twyford Abbey , near  Ealing , which the Alexian Brothers had purchased.     [ edit ]   The Modern Order   The American branch of the order provide services in acute care, residential elderly care, retirement centers, and AIDS ministry in  Illinois ,  Missouri ,  Wisconsin ,  Tennessee ,  Chicago , and also outside the USA in the  Philippines  and  Hungary .   The contemporary British and Irish establishments in  London ,  Manchester ,  Dublin  and  Limerick  include facilities for the elderly sick and physically handicapped through a nursing home and Day Centre; an AIDS ministry; care and rehabilitation of homeless men; and support for people suffering from mental illness.   On the European continent the contemporary German branch of the order has houses in  Aachen ,  Krefeld ,  Malseneck ,  Mnster  and  Twistringen . In Belgium they have centres in  Boechout ,  Tienen ,  Grimbergen  and Henri-Chapelle where they provide psychiatric services.

Certain laymen united under the guidance of a man named Tobias to succor the plague-stricken, without taking any vows or adopting a rule of life. One of their most obvious actions being the burial of those who died from the plague; they were known as  ""Cellites""  (from Latin  cella , a cell and hence a grave). Later on, they chose as their patron  St. Alexius , a saint who served many years in a hospital at  Edessa  in  Syria ; and thenceforth they called themselves the Alexian Brothers.   They rapidly spread through-out  Germany ,  Brabant , Flanders, and other countries. They were also styled  ""Lollhorden""  (Old  German :  lollon ), meaning  ""to sing softly,""  from their chants for the dead. As a result they were sometimes confused with the  Lollards , a  Wyclifian   sect  of  heretics . They did not escape calumny and persecution, as demonstrated from the  Papal Bull   ""Ad Audientiam Nostram""  ( 2 December   1377 ) which  Pope Gregory XI  sent to the German bishops, especially those of  Cologne ,  Trier  and  Mainz , forbidding annoyance of the  ""Cellites""  and enjoining punishment for their persecutors. This was followed by Bulls of a similar tenor from  Pope Boniface IX  on  7 January   1396 ,  Pope Eugene IV  on  12 May   1431 ,  Pope Nicholas V  and  Pope Pius II .   In 1469, the mother-house at  Aix-la-Chapelle  voiced the general feeling of the Brothers in asking the  Louis de Bourbon, prince-bishop of Lige  to raise that house to a convent of the  Order of St. Augustine . The request was granted, and Father Dominicus Brock and five of the Brothers took the solemn vows of religious. This step and the revised constitution of the Order were confirmed by  Blessed Pius IX  on  12 September   1870 .   In the early 20th century the Alexian Brothers had four hospitals in the United States. The first was built in  Chicago  in the year 1866; it was destroyed by the  Great Fire , on  9 October   1871 , and rebuilt the following year. The second, erected at  St Louis  in 1869, covers an acre with its departments for the insane, nervous diseases, and inebriates. The third is in  Oshkosh, Wisconsin  and built in the year 1880.

Senior pastor  Rick Warren 's stated intention in launching the P E A C E (or PEACE) Plan is to involve every  Christian  and every  church  in every nation in the task of serving people in the areas of the greatest global needs. The tag-line is ' Ordinary people empowered by God making a difference together wherever they are' . P E A C E is an  acronym  for the stated methodology for achieving the plan: "" P romote reconciliation -  E quip servant leaders -  A ssist the poor -  C are for the sick -  E ducate the next generation.""

A strategy for addressing these problems would be to ""do what Jesus did"", and this intention is translated into the five elements making up the P E A C E acronym. They are:     P - promote reconciliation   E - equip servant leaders   A - assist the poor   C - care for the sick   E - educate the next generation       [ edit ]   Action   In 2005,  Time magazine  reported that Warren had been asked by  Rwandan  President  Paul Kagame  to help his country become a ""Purpose-Driven nation"". [ 1 ]  To implement this, Warren has enlisted over 2,000 Saddleback Church members to go to Rwanda in small groups to initiate a national strategy, and the cooperation of 600 Rwandan churches. Business leaders and leaders of parliament in Rwanda are also involved.     [ edit ]   3-Legged Stool Concept   This concept was introduced by the business management writer  Peter Drucker  as a means to bring together the different sectors in society. Drucker believed that the only way to persuade the world to accept change was to engage public, private and social sectors, working together to effect change. The three ""legs"" of the stool are:     a public sector of effective governments   a private sector of effective businesses   a social sector of effective community organizations, including faith-based organizations     Rick Warren was mentored by Peter Drucker for several years and has been promoting the 3-legged stool concept with vigor. Now Warren is using the Stool Concept in conjunction with his P.E.A.C.E. Plan.

In the early 20th century the Alexian Brothers had four hospitals in the United States. The first was built in  Chicago  in the year 1866; it was destroyed by the  Great Fire , on  9 October   1871 , and rebuilt the following year. The second, erected at  St Louis  in 1869, covers an acre with its departments for the insane, nervous diseases, and inebriates. The third is in  Oshkosh, Wisconsin  and built in the year 1880. The fourth was built in  Elizabeth, N.J. , on land given for that purpose by Right Rev. Bishop Wigger. Competent surgeons and physicians attend to the patients, and the Brothers nurse and do the housework of the hospitals.   Bishop  Herbert Vaughan  of  Salford ,  England  (later, Cardinal), invited the Alexian Brothers to take charge of a new home and hospital in his diocese, which led to their establishing themselves in England in June 1875. Dr Richard Lacy,  Bishop of Middlesbrough , secured them for his diocese in 1884. In 1885, the Brothers established a Province of their Order and a novitiate in the  United Kingdom . The latter, first attached to St. Mary's Convent,  Newton Heath ,  Manchester , was later transferred to  Twyford Abbey , near  Ealing , which the Alexian Brothers had purchased.     [ edit ]   The Modern Order   The American branch of the order provide services in acute care, residential elderly care, retirement centers, and AIDS ministry in  Illinois ,  Missouri ,  Wisconsin ,  Tennessee ,  Chicago , and also outside the USA in the  Philippines  and  Hungary .   The contemporary British and Irish establishments in  London ,  Manchester ,  Dublin  and  Limerick  include facilities for the elderly sick and physically handicapped through a nursing home and Day Centre; an AIDS ministry; care and rehabilitation of homeless men; and support for people suffering from mental illness.   On the European continent the contemporary German branch of the order has houses in  Aachen ,  Krefeld ,  Malseneck ,  Mnster  and  Twistringen . In Belgium they have centres in  Boechout ,  Tienen ,  Grimbergen  and Henri-Chapelle where they provide psychiatric services.

Certain laymen united under the guidance of a man named Tobias to succor the plague-stricken, without taking any vows or adopting a rule of life. One of their most obvious actions being the burial of those who died from the plague; they were known as  ""Cellites""  (from Latin  cella , a cell and hence a grave). Later on, they chose as their patron  St. Alexius , a saint who served many years in a hospital at  Edessa  in  Syria ; and thenceforth they called themselves the Alexian Brothers.   They rapidly spread through-out  Germany ,  Brabant , Flanders, and other countries. They were also styled  ""Lollhorden""  (Old  German :  lollon ), meaning  ""to sing softly,""  from their chants for the dead. As a result they were sometimes confused with the  Lollards , a  Wyclifian   sect  of  heretics . They did not escape calumny and persecution, as demonstrated from the  Papal Bull   ""Ad Audientiam Nostram""  ( 2 December   1377 ) which  Pope Gregory XI  sent to the German bishops, especially those of  Cologne ,  Trier  and  Mainz , forbidding annoyance of the  ""Cellites""  and enjoining punishment for their persecutors. This was followed by Bulls of a similar tenor from  Pope Boniface IX  on  7 January   1396 ,  Pope Eugene IV  on  12 May   1431 ,  Pope Nicholas V  and  Pope Pius II .   In 1469, the mother-house at  Aix-la-Chapelle  voiced the general feeling of the Brothers in asking the  Louis de Bourbon, prince-bishop of Lige  to raise that house to a convent of the  Order of St. Augustine . The request was granted, and Father Dominicus Brock and five of the Brothers took the solemn vows of religious. This step and the revised constitution of the Order were confirmed by  Blessed Pius IX  on  12 September   1870 .   In the early 20th century the Alexian Brothers had four hospitals in the United States. The first was built in  Chicago  in the year 1866; it was destroyed by the  Great Fire , on  9 October   1871 , and rebuilt the following year. The second, erected at  St Louis  in 1869, covers an acre with its departments for the insane, nervous diseases, and inebriates. The third is in  Oshkosh, Wisconsin  and built in the year 1880. The fourth was built in  Elizabeth, N.J. , on land given for that purpose by Right Rev. Bishop Wigger. Competent surgeons and physicians attend to the patients, and the Brothers nurse and do the housework of the hospitals.   Bishop  Herbert Vaughan  of  Salford ,  England  (later, Cardinal), invited the Alexian Brothers to take charge of a new home and hospital in his diocese, which led to their establishing themselves in England in June 1875. Dr Richard Lacy,  Bishop of Middlesbrough , secured them for his diocese in 1884. In 1885, the Brothers established a Province of their Order and a novitiate in the  United Kingdom . The latter, first attached to St. Mary's Convent,  Newton Heath ,  Manchester , was later transferred to  Twyford Abbey , near  Ealing , which the Alexian Brothers had purchased.     [ edit ]   The Modern Order   The American branch of the order provide services in acute care, residential elderly care, retirement centers, and AIDS ministry in  Illinois ,  Missouri ,  Wisconsin ,  Tennessee ,  Chicago , and also outside the USA in the  Philippines  and  Hungary .   The contemporary British and Irish establishments in  London ,  Manchester ,  Dublin  and  Limerick  include facilities for the elderly sick and physically handicapped through a nursing home and Day Centre; an AIDS ministry; care and rehabilitation of homeless men; and support for people suffering from mental illness.   On the European continent the contemporary German branch of the order has houses in  Aachen ,  Krefeld ,  Malseneck ,  Mnster  and  Twistringen . In Belgium they have centres in  Boechout ,  Tienen ,  Grimbergen  and Henri-Chapelle where they provide psychiatric services.

His goal is a second Reformation by restoring responsibility in people, credibility in churches, and civility in culture. He is a pastor, global strategist, theologian, and philanthropist. He’s been often named ""America's most influential spiritual leader"" and “America’s Pastor.”(1)                        As a pastor, he founded Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, Calif., in 1980 with one family. Today, it is an evangelical congregation averaging 22,000 weekly attendees, a 120-acre campus, and has more than 300 community ministries to groups such as prisoners, CEOs, addicts, single parents, and those with HIV/AIDS. Recently, the church fed 42,000 homeless people – three meals a day – for 40 days.                       He also leads the Purpose Driven Network of churches, a global coalition of congregations in 162 countries. More than 400,000 ministers and priests have been trained worldwide, and almost 157,000 church leaders subscribe to the Ministry ToolBox, his weekly newsletter. His previous book, The Purpose Driven Church is listed in “100 Christian Books That Changed the 20th Century.”  Forbes magazine called it ""the best book on entrepreneurship, management, and leadership in print.”                       As a global strategist , Dr. Warren advises leaders in the public, private, and faith sectors on leadership development, poverty, health, education, and faith in culture. He has been invited to speak at the United Nations, the World Economic Forum in Davos, the African Union, the Council on Foreign Relations, Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, TIME’s Global Health Summit, and numerous congresses around the world. TIME magazine named him one of “15 World Leaders Who Mattered Most in 2004” and in 2005 one of the “100 Most Influential People in the World.” Also, in 2005 U.S. News & World Report named him one of “America’s 25 Best Leaders.”                       As a theologian , Dr. Warren has lectured at Oxford, Cambridge, the University of Judaism, the Evangelical Theological Society, and numerous seminaries and universities. His six books are known for explaining theology in understandable ways and have been translated into more than 50 languages. Dr. Warren says he teaches theology without using theological terms and telling people it is theology. His latest book, The Purpose Driven Life, has sold 25 million copies and is the best-selling hardback book in American history, according to Publisher’s Weekly.                       As philanthropists , Rick and Kay Warren give away 90 percent of their income through three foundations: Acts of Mercy, which serves those infected and affected by AIDS; Equipping the Church, which trains church leaders in developing countries; and The Global PEACE Fund, which fights poverty, disease, and illiteracy.                       MEDIA QUOTES                       The Weekly Standard - “… clearly among the two or three most influential Americans working from the west coast.”                       The Economist - “Rick Warren is arguably the most influential pastor in America.”                       The Times (London) - “Business and political leaders across America are turning to Rick Warren for guidance.”                       Forbes - “Were it a business, Saddleback Church would be compared with Dell, Google or Starbucks.”                        ABC News - “The Purpose Driven Life is the epicenter of a spiritual shockwave taking root across America in unlikely places like offices and university campuses.

Senior pastor  Rick Warren 's stated intention in launching the P E A C E (or PEACE) Plan is to involve every  Christian  and every  church  in every nation in the task of serving people in the areas of the greatest global needs. The tag-line is ' Ordinary people empowered by God making a difference together wherever they are' . P E A C E is an  acronym  for the stated methodology for achieving the plan: "" P romote reconciliation -  E quip servant leaders -  A ssist the poor -  C are for the sick -  E ducate the next generation.""

A strategy for addressing these problems would be to ""do what Jesus did"", and this intention is translated into the five elements making up the P E A C E acronym. They are:     P - promote reconciliation   E - equip servant leaders   A - assist the poor   C - care for the sick   E - educate the next generation       [ edit ]   Action   In 2005,  Time magazine  reported that Warren had been asked by  Rwandan  President  Paul Kagame  to help his country become a ""Purpose-Driven nation"". [ 1 ]  To implement this, Warren has enlisted over 2,000 Saddleback Church members to go to Rwanda in small groups to initiate a national strategy, and the cooperation of 600 Rwandan churches. Business leaders and leaders of parliament in Rwanda are also involved.     [ edit ]   3-Legged Stool Concept   This concept was introduced by the business management writer  Peter Drucker  as a means to bring together the different sectors in society. Drucker believed that the only way to persuade the world to accept change was to engage public, private and social sectors, working together to effect change. The three ""legs"" of the stool are:     a public sector of effective governments   a private sector of effective businesses   a social sector of effective community organizations, including faith-based organizations     Rick Warren was mentored by Peter Drucker for several years and has been promoting the 3-legged stool concept with vigor. Now Warren is using the Stool Concept in conjunction with his P.E.A.C.E. Plan.

clueweb09-enwp01-80-11146	"                     Purpose Driven          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (January 2009)       The trademarked term  purpose driven  comes from the teaching of  Rick Warren , senior pastor of  Saddleback Church  in Lake Forest, California. It originally came into use as a  paradigm  taught to pastors and other  Christian  leaders worldwide to help them be more effective in leading their churches. This teaching is embodied in Warrens best-selling book,  The Purpose Driven Church , first published in 1995. [ 1 ]   The basic premise of the Purpose Driven paradigm is for a pastor to recognize and be obedient to Gods  purposes  for his people and his  church  and organize around developing these characteristics into the lives of people within his care. In Christian terms, this is the task of  making  disciples . An additional focus is how to be most effective in reaching out to share Gods love and  forgiveness  in the local community and with non-believers who visit the church. In Christian terms, this is the task of  evangelism . To be purpose driven is to be driven by Gods purposes, not our own. [ 1 ]   These purposes, according to Warrens teaching, are found in two verses in the  New Testament  book of  Matthew . These two passages, located in Matthew chapters 22 and 28, are often referred to by Christians worldwide as the  Great Commandment  and the  Great Commission . From these verses, Warren identified five purposes: worship, ministry, mission, fellowship, and discipleship. [ 1 ]         Love the Lord your God with all your heart  and with all your soul and with all your mind... Love your neighbor as yourself . All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.  Matthew 22:3740 (NIV)   Worship   Love the Lord your God with all your heart       Ministry   Love your neighbor as yourself                Go and make disciples  of all nations,  baptizing them  in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and  teaching them to obey  everything I have commanded you.  Matthew 28:1920 (NIV)   Mission   Go and make disciples       Fellowship   baptizing them       Discipleship   teaching them to obey        In 2002, Warren wrote  The Purpose Driven Life  as a 40-day devotional book. [ 2 ]  This has become an international best seller, with over 30 million copies in print by 2006. [ 3 ]  This book took the same five purposes and focused on the life of the individual Christian. The book starts out with the words, "" Its not about you,  meaning the life that God created us to live is one driven by his purposes, not our own desires. [ 2 ]   The tenets of the Purpose Driven paradigm have been taught to hundreds of thousands of Christian leaders worldwide through conferences and seminars, with many pastors adopting the principles in their churches. While there is no formal Purpose Driven organization  this activity being an outreach of Saddleback Church  there is an informal worldwide  network  of churches that work together to train other leaders, publish training resources in local languages, and collaborate on evangelistic and social action activities. This latter activity of evangelism and social action has developed into a strategy called The  P.E.A.C.E. Plan , in which many of these same churches also are involved.   The Purpose Driven paradigm is a set of principles and processes based on an understanding of the biblical purposes for the church. Implementing this paradigm enables the church leader to be most effective in reaching out to people in love, welcoming them into the fellowship of the local church, encouraging and training them for Christ-like behavior, and equipping them for volunteer service within the church  all as an expression of their worship to God. Simply put, the Purpose Driven paradigm encourages the Christian leader to maintain an intentional,  strategic , and balanced focus on all five purposes, which will in turn produce church health. The concept focuses on health, with the conviction that growth will take care of itself when a congregation is healthy. The paradigm is being utilized by churches in many denominations and theological expressions across many cultures worldwide.

On Wednesday, the transition team announced that Rick Warren, pastor of the powerful Saddleback Church, would give the invocation on January 20th. The selection may not have been incredibly surprising. Obama and Warren are reportedly close -- Obama praised the Megachurch leader in his second book ""The Audacity of Hope."" Warren, meanwhile, hosted a values forum between Obama and McCain during the general election. Nevertheless, the announcement is being greeted with deep skepticism in progressive religious and political circles.    ""My blood pressure is really high right now,"" said Rev. Chuck Currie, minister at Parkrose Community United Church of Christ in Portland, Oregon. ""Rick Warren does some really good stuff and there are some areas that I have admired his ability to build bridges between evangelicals and mainline religious and political figures... but he is also very established in the religious right and his position on social issues like gay rights, stem cell research and women's rights are all out of the mainstream and are very much opposed to the progressive agenda that Obama ran on.

Sign Up Discuss  in my Forum   Rick Warren Biography By  Mary Fairchild , About.com    See More About: rick warren christian authors christian celebrities christian men     Rick Warren with President Bush Photo: Mark Wilson / Getty Images More Images  (3)          Pastor Rick Warren:  Rick Warren is the founding pastor of  Saddleback Church  in Lake Forest, California, a Christian community that he and his wife began in their home in 1980, with just one other family. Today Saddleback is one of the most prominent churches in America with more than 20,000 members attending four campuses each week, reaching out through some 200 ministries. The well-known evangelical Christian leader rose to worldwide fame after publishing his wildly popular book,  The Purpose Driven Life , in 2002. To date, the title has sold more than 30 million copies, making it the top selling hardcover book of all time. Date of Birth:  January 28, 1954.  Family & Home:   Rick Warren was born in San Jose, California and raised as a  Southern Baptist  preacher's kid. Along with  Billy Graham , he considers his late father to be one of the most important role models in his life. Also interesting to note, his great-grandfather and father-in-law were pastors as well. Rick has been married to his wife Kay (Elizabeth K. Warren) for more than 30 years. They have three adult children and three grandchildren and currently make their home in Orange County, California. Education & Ministry:  Warren graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from California Baptist University and earned a Master of Divinity from Southwestern Theological Seminary. He also holds a Doctor of Ministry degree from Fuller Theological Seminary. After completing seminary, Rick and Kay felt called to start a fellowship to reach people who didn't attend church. Joined by one other family, they began a small Bible study in their home in Saddleback Valley. The group quickly grew, and by Easter of 1980, they welcomed 205 mostly unchurched people to their first public service. Saddleback Valley Community Church was born, launching the Warrens and their community of new believers on an unprecedented journey of growth and faith. Today the church reports ""one in nine people in the area call Saddleback their church home.""  Keeping ties with the Southern Baptist Convention , Saddleback does not identify itself as a Baptist church. Getting people connected is one of the main missions of the church, boasting ""something for everyone"" in their ministries.    Developed at Saddleback,  Celebrate Recovery  is now a widely known Christian ministry for people struggling with addictive behaviors. Based on eight principles found in the  Beatitudes , this faith-centered approach to recovery has been implemented in churches across the U.S. and internationally. Saddleback has also launched an  HIV/AIDS Initiative  to bring education and awareness to churches and  encourage involvement in the fight against HIV and AIDS.   Besides building a megachurch ministry, Warren has established the  Purpose Driven Church Network , a massive global effort to train pastors in theology and practical ministry and establish purpose driven churches around the world. He has also created a website called  Pastors.com  to provide online sermons, tools, a newsletter, a forum community, and many other practical resources for pastors and ministry leaders. Not afraid to think big, Rick and his wife have pursued global missions with a unique approach called  The Peace Plan . Their solution involves mobilizing Christians around the world through outreaches to attack ""the five global giants"" of ""extreme poverty, disease, spiritual emptiness, self-serving leadership, and illiteracy."" The efforts include ""promoting reconciliation, equipping servant leaders, assisting the poor, caring for the sick, and educating the next generation."" Speaking about his ""purpose driven"" success, in 2005 Warren told  U.S. News and World Report , ""It brought in a ton of money. The first thing we decided was that we wouldn't let it change our lifestyle one bit."" Even after achieving notoriety and great prosperity, Warren and his family continued to live in the same home and drive the same vehicle. He said, ""Next, I stopped taking a salary from the church. Then I added up all the church had paid me in the previous 25 years and I gave it back."" Living on only 10% of their income, he and his wife began to give away the rest in a type of ""reverse tithing"" principle. Demonstrating a model of integrity among Christian leaders, Rick Warren has managed to live out his convictions and stay committed to his family over the long haul of his life in ministry. Remaining humble and down-to-earth in the face of great success has earned him the respect of religious leaders and world leaders alike. Author:  In addiction to  The Purpose Driven Life , Rick Warren has written several popular Christian books which have been translated into some 50 languages.     The Purpose Driven Church  (1995)  Answers to Life's Difficult Questions  (1999)  The Purpose Driven Life  (2002)  What on Earth Am I Here For?

Criswell  preach at the Jack Tar Hotel in  San Francisco . [ 2 ]  Rick Warren stood in line to shake hands with Dr. Criswell afterwards. [ 2 ]          When my turn finally arrived, something unexpected happened. Criswell looked at me with kind, loving eyes and said, quite emphatically, 'Young man, I feel led to lay hands on you and pray for you!' He placed his hands on my head and prayed: 'Father, I ask that you give this young preacher a double portion of your Spirit. May the church he pastors grow to twice the size of the Dallas church. Bless him greatly, O Lord.' [ 2 ]          Saddleback's first public service was held on  Easter  Sunday, April 6, 1980, with two hundred people in attendance at the  Laguna Hills  High School Theater. Warren's innovative  church growth  methods led to rapid growth and the church has used nearly eighty different facilities in its 28-year history.   Saddleback did not build its first permanent building until it had 10,000 weekly attenders. When the current Lake Forest campus was purchased in the early 1990's, a 2,300 seat plastic tent was used for worship services for several years, with four services each weekend. In 1995, the current Worship Center was completed with a seating capacity of 3,500. The multi-million dollar Children's Ministry Center (housing the  All Stars  children's ministry) and staff office building were completed over the next few years. In June 2008, a $20 million, state-of-the-art student ministry facility called the  Refinery , was completed. The  Refinery  houses the middle school ( Wildside ) and high school ( HSM ) ministries, consisting of nearly 1,500 students. [ 3 ]   The Purpose Driven Church  (PDC) curriculum [ 4 ]  and  Celebrate Recovery  program [ 5 ]  were founded at Saddleback Church. Saddleback currently has 3 regional campuses:  San Clemente ,  Irvine , and  Corona . Several more campuses are planned in the next few years.

The summit featured 60 speakers, including Senators  Barack Obama  and  Sam Brownback . The appearance of Obama at the church was controversial because of his  pro-choice  stance, while Rick Warren and most Evangelicals are pro-life. The controversy was reignited when  Hillary Clinton  spoke at the 2007 summit. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Civil Forum on the Presidency   On August 16, 2008, Rick Warren arranged a meeting between Senators  John McCain  and Barack Obama at Saddleback called the  Civil Forum on The Presidency . The format of the forum was structured such that Warren first asked Sen. Obama a series of questions; he then asked Sen. McCain very similar ones subsequently. Held inside Saddleback's Worship Center, the event is notable as the first time the two Presidential candidates met during the campaign. [ citation needed ]  It was broadcast live on national news networks and streamed online. Tickets were distributed to church members through a raffle with seats listing as high as $1,000 and the event was sold out. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   See also     Doug Fields   P.E.A.C.E.

clueweb09-enwp02-22-12885	"                     The Purpose Driven Church          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 Cover of the ""Purpose Drive Church       The Purpose Driven Church  (1995) is a book written by  Rick Warren , founder and senior  pastor  of  Saddleback Church  in  Lake Forest, California ,  USA . It was first published in 1995. It is subtitled, "" Growth Without Compromising Your Message & Mission ."" In a May 2005 survey of American pastors and ministers conducted by  George Barna ,  [ 1 ]   The Purpose Driven Church  was voted as the second book most influential on their lives and ministries, behind  The Purpose Driven Life , a subsequent book by Rick Warren.   The book is targeted to pastors and church leaders and advises them to base their ministry on God's purposes, not their own ideas of ministry, hence the term "" Purpose Driven "". Warren suggests that these purposes are  Worship ,  Fellowship ,  Discipleship ,  Ministry  and  Mission  and that they are derived from the  Great Commandment  ( Matthew 22:37-40 ) and the  Great Commission  ( Matthew 28:19-20 ).   Warren writes that every church is driven by something. Tradition, finances, programs, personalities, events, seekers and even buildings can each be the controlling force in a church. But he believes that in order for a church to be healthy it must built around the five  New Testament  purposes given to the church by  Jesus . ""The issue is church health, not  church growth !"" declares Warren. ""If your church is healthy, growth will occur naturally. Healthy, consistent growth is the result of balancing the five  biblical  purposes of the church.""   He proposes that church leaders ask of themselves, ""What is our purpose?"", ""Why do we do what we do?"", ""What should we be doing?"", and ""How will you do that?"". In this book Warren provides a guide to answer these questions on how to do church. He further suggests that following the principles he outlines in the book will enable a church to grow         Warmer through fellowship   Deeper through discipleship   Stronger through worship   Broader through ministry, and   Larger through evangelism.         The author emphasizes an intentional people-building process. He says, If you will concentrate on building people, God will build the church.   The teaching of  The Purpose Driven Church  was derived from Warren's own experience in leading  Saddleback Church  from its founding in 1980 to over 10,000 in worship attendance in its first fifteen years, becoming one of the fastest growing churches in America during this time.  [ 2 ]   The  Purpose Driven Church  has been translated into over 30 languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German. It is listed in  100 Christian Books That Changed the Century   [ 3 ]  and has been given many awards. For example, in 1996 and 1997, the book was the  Evangelical Christian Publishers Association  (ECPA)  Christian Book Award Winner  for the US. In 2002, the ECPA awarded it the Gold Medallion Award. [ 4 ]  The book and its author has received numerous reviews in the mainstream press and has been the subject of much support and criticism in Christian blogs and newsletters. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  In 2005, Time magazine called Rick Warren ""America's pastor.""

Woodson,  (1875-1950) noted Black scholar and historian   and son of former slaves, founded the Association for the Study of Negro   Life and History in 1915, which was later renamed the  Association   for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) .He initiated   Black History Week, February 12, 1926. For many years the 2nd week of February   (chosen so as to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and   Abraham Lincoln) was celebrated by Black people in the United States. In   1976, as part of the nation's Bicentennial, it was expanded and became   established as Black History Month, and is now celebrated all over North   America.      The  ASALH  has established the national   theme since 1926. The Association has historically worked to conserve,   preserve and perpetuate African American history and culture.

Martin Luther King Center   Website  http://www.thekingcenter.org/           On April 8, 1968 - four days after Dr. King was assassinated - Congressman     John Conyers (D-Mich) introduced the first legistlation providing for a     federal holiday. But that dream wasn't realized until nearly 20 years later       All through the 1970's and 80's controversy surrounded the idea of a     Martin Luther King Day. Congresspersons and citizens had petitioned the     President to make January 15, Martin Luther King's birthday, a federal     legal holiday. Others wanted to make the holiday on the day he died...while     some people did not want to have a holiday at all.       January 15 had been observed as a legal holiday for many years in 27     states and Washington, D.C. Finally, in 1986, President Ronald Reagan declared     the third Monday in January a federal legal holiday commemorating Dr. Martin     Luther King's birthday. Yet not until 1999 was the holiday celebrated by     all 50 states. The holiday is celebrated in some form in 100 countries     around the world.

It was created in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga, a scholar-activist   who is currently professor and chair of the Department of Black Studies   at California State University at Long Beach. It is an African American   holiday based on harvest festivals, and celebrates family, community and   culture.     The U.S. Post Office has a $.37 Kwanzaa commemorative stamp.

It also provides a section of ""Frequently   Asked Questions,"" an annual greeting from Dr. Karenga, and recommended   books, music and videos.     As the popularity of Kwanzaa grows, it has also become commercialized.   ""Therefore, the central interest of this website is to provide information   which reveals and reaffirms the integrity, beauty and expansive meaning   of the holiday and thus aids in our approaching it with the depth of thought,   dignity, and sense of specialness it deserves.""

In addition   to a wide range of instrumental pieces, the album features eight specifically   chosen vocal performances, ranging from traditional African songs to contemporary   composed pieces. A standout for me is ""Mya Si Grei"", a traditional   song which originated in Guyana, sung by enslaved Africans and passed down   to their children. The lyrics roughly translate into ""Even though   we are here in these terrible conditions, we are still the same proud,   noble people we always were.""

Such was the case in Galveston, Texas. Not   until June 19, 1865, did Union soldiers land with news that the war had   ended and that all slaves were now free.     This news was met with both shock and jubilation, and June 19, or Juneteenth,   became the oldest known celebration of the end of slavery. The remembrance   of those festivities became particularly precious to former slaves and   their decendents, and has grown today to a worldwide celebration.

Red represents   the blood of all black people, black stands for the black race and green   symbolizes land and nationhood.     The UNIA still has about 2000 members worldwide.

Available at  Amazon.com        Marcus Garvey was many things to many people. To the elite of the Harlem   Renaissance, he was a buffoon. To J. Edgar Hoover, he was a dangerous activitist...so   feared that the first black FBI agent was hired solely to infiltrate the   UNIA movement. But to hundreds of thousands - perhaps millions - of African   people around the world he brought a message of hope, pride and unity which   laid the foundation for the Black Power Movement. This video is rich in   music and imagery, and many points of view are expressed through interviews   with black historians, Garvey's contemporaries and two sons, and former   UNIA members.

clueweb09-en0004-52-23784	"      BishopAccountability.org                   List of 43 Abusive Priests Released  Dolan Names Only Diocesan Clergy in Long-Awaited Move  By Tom Heinen  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel [Wisconsin]  July 10, 2004  After nearly two years of deliberation and consultation, Milwaukee Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan released on Friday the names of 43 current or former diocesan priests with substantiated allegations of sexual abuse of minors.  In doing so, he joined the ranks of Roman Catholic bishops in other cities — including Baltimore; Los Angeles; Madison; Toledo, Ohio; and Tucson, Ariz. — who have taken similar actions.  About a dozen of the names had not been previously reported.  Dolan's decision is a significant step toward restoring trust and encouraging other victims to come forward, said Anne Burke, interim chairwoman of the bishops' National Review Board on sexual abuse. However, victims groups pointed out that the various religious orders whose priests serve in the archdiocese have not taken the same step and called on Dolan to do more.   Burke said that because Dolan is in a leadership position as chairman of the bishops' Committee on Priestly Life and Ministry, his voice may carry beyond Milwaukee.  ""He's considered a leader, and I think that it does help ...,"" Burke said. ""I think that it's important for the community to know that the diocese is transparent with this and that they are not trying to hide anything.""   Not all accused named  Burke, an Illinois appellate judge, was pleased that Milwaukee had not released names of priests who had faced unsubstantiated allegations or ones that were not investigated. Citing due process concerns, she criticized the Archdiocese of Chicago for releasing names of priests if there was any reason to suspect they had abused a minor.  Dolan, in his weekly e-mail message to parish and archdiocesan personnel on Friday, acknowledged that the release of the names ""may cause another shock wave to move through your parish community"" and that he might be criticized.  ""Some will see it as a vengeful act,"" Dolan wrote. ""Others will see it as too little, too late. Others will question why the names of religious order priests are excluded. Some will criticize me for not releasing information about every priest that has ever been accused, but whose alleged offense has never been substantiated.  ""As I weighed these issues during the past months, I kept coming to the same conclusion — anything we can do to keep children safe, we must do. Anything we can do to help people who have been victimized come forward, we must do. ...""  After the Archdiocese of Baltimore released the names of 56 accused priests in 2002, more than 60 victims came forward, said Sean Caine, its director of communications.  One Dolan critic on Friday was Peter Isely, a regional spokesman for the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, whose group has long sought a release of names.  Isely contended that the list did not include about half the abusers — the religious order priests — and that most of the names already were known.  David Clohessy, SNAP's national director, said it was ""sad that it has taken years of pressure from victims and parishioners to get this tiny step forward. And often as many as a third of the priests in any diocese are religious order priests. He (Dolan) has a duty to release whatever religious order names he has and determine whether there are others he doesn't have.""  Archdiocesan spokesman Jerry Topczewski said that Dolan, who meets twice a year with the heads of religious orders that have ministries here, sent a letter to them Friday urging them to follow his example and release the names.  ""As the archbishop of Milwaukee, he does not have the authority (under church law) to interfere with the normal business of a religious order,"" Topczewski said.   Dolan's move praised  Terry Ryan, acting as a spokeswoman for the local Voice of the Faithful and Call to Action reform groups, praised Dolan's move toward greater openness and transparency in a statement: ""It's a necessary step on the road to accountability and restoring credibility. Hopefully this action will remove the cloud of suspicion from priests of integrity ... It's important that this same degree of disclosure occur among religious orders. ...""  There are 414 diocesan priests and 345 religious order priests in the archdiocese, Topczewski said.  The list of 43 priests is posted at the archdiocesan Web site. The archdiocese previously said that there were 45 priests, but a more detailed look at the credibility of allegations lowered the list by two, Topczewski said.  The list includes 23 current priests who receive a minimal income, are fully restricted, and cannot do any public ministry, wear clerical garb, or represent themselves as priests. All of their cases have been forwarded or are being forwarded to the Vatican, whose Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith will consider several options, Topczewski said.  Under the norms approved by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Vatican, any priest who commits even a single act of sexual abuse of a minor will be removed permanently from ministry. Although elderly and infirm priests may be allowed to continue in the priesthood in secluded prayer and penance, most of the others are expected to face laicization.  The list also includes 14 deceased priests, three laicized priests, one priest whose return to the lay state is under appeal, and two priests who simply left their ministry.  Although an earlier report also said that two deacons had credible allegations against them, their names were not included in the list. Topczewski said their status had not been addressed yet.

Members of St. James, St. Kilian in Hartford and St. Frances Cabrini in West Bend learned Sunday about the past abuse by Haen from a column by Jim Stingl in the Journal Sentinel.  Stan Kulfan of Mequon, a former parish council member at St. James and a current Ozaukee County Board supervisor, said Tuesday he was in ""complete shock"" to learn Haen led a secret life that involved molesting children.  Haen was liked and respected, but church leaders should think about removing his name from church property, Kulfan said.  ""I think the inclination would be that the name of the room should probably be changed,"" Kulfan said.  Jerry Topczewski, spokesman for the Milwaukee Archdiocese, did not return phone calls for comment Tuesday. Archbishop Rembert Weakland will talk with the priests from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. today in a meeting that will be closed to the public.  Columnist Stingl reported that Haen had abused John Maurice when he was an altar boy in Milwaukee in the 1940s.  Maurice, now 70, estimated that Haen molested and sodomized him more than 100 times while he was a pupil at St. Lawrence Church near Layton Blvd. and Greenfield Ave. in Milwaukee. Maurice said he knew of at least two other boys Haen had abused. Maurice said some of the abuse occurred at Haen's family farm in Sheboygan County.  Haen was transferred in 1947 to St. Kilian in Hartford and in 1955 to St. Frances Cabrini in West Bend. He was sent to Mequon in 1972, where he remained until 1990, a year after Maurice reported Haen's abuse to Weakland.  Auxiliary Bishop Richard Sklba later wrote Maurice saying that Haen, when confronted with Maurice's allegations, ""acknowledged responsibility for unacceptable behavior on his part."" Haen was forced into retirement in 1990 and restricted from performing priestly duties in 1992. He died seven years later at age 81.  Kulfan and members of churches in Hartford and West Bend said they had no idea about Haen's past. Haen officiated at Kulfan's wedding when he married his wife, Joan, in 1974.   Remaining faithful  Parishioners respected Haen for working hard to construct a new church in the mid-1970s, Kulfan said. He remembered Haen for having a strong personality that was suited to managing such a large task.  ""I had respect for Father Haen - and I still do,"" said Kulfan, who served on the church council after Kulfan left the parish. ""I have respect for all clergy. Of course, I am disappointed in what's occurred. But my faith isn't tied to the acts of one priest. It's not for me to judge. The good Lord will do that.""  Victor Albiero, a charter member of St. Frances Cabrini, said he ""was sick"" when he read about Haen's sexual involvement with young boys.  ""I'm sure there were some people who knew what was going on,"" but he was not one of them, Albiero said.  Albiero also admired Haen's determination to construct a new church for the parish soon after arriving at the West Bend parish. Members had been conducting services in a school gymnasium until Haen took charge of erecting a new sanctuary, Albiero said.  ""I always said to my wife, 'If I was the bishop, I would move him around just to build churches,' "" Albiero said. ""He was very good at it.""  Albiero said he never heard anything negative about Haen, and the latest revelations did nothing to shake his faith in the Catholic Church.  Paul Quick, 78, a lifelong member of St. Kilian, remembered Haen ""as a good guy."" News of Haen's hidden past came as ""a big surprise,"" he said.  ""I knew him very well,"" Quick said. ""He was a very nice individual. I never heard anything negative about him at all. I guess you just never know.""

""Rick"" Warren  (born  January 28 ,  1954 ) is the founding and senior pastor of  Saddleback Church . He is also the author of many  Christian  books, including  The Purpose Driven Life , and a major (and occasionally controversial) figure amongst the  Southern Baptists  in the United States. Warren was born in  San Jose, California , in 1954, the son of Jimmy and Dot Warren. His father was a Baptist minister, his mother a high school librarian.  Warren was named one of  America's Top 25 Leaders  in the October 31, 2005 issue of  U.S. News and World Report . Warren was elected by  TIME magazine  as one of  15 World Leaders Who Mattered Most in 2004  and one of the  100 Most Influential People in the World  (2005). Newsweek  magazine called him one of ""15 People Who Make America Great"", an award given to people who, through bravery or generosity, genius or passion, devote themselves to helping others.   Warren has been married to Elizabeth K. Warren (Kay) for thirty years. They have three adult children (Josh, Amy, and Matthew) and two grandchildren. He considers  Billy Graham ,  Peter Drucker , and his own father (who was himself a Baptist pastor and an  SBC  missionary), to be among his mentors.                                                                                            Rick Warren                                                                 Saddleback Church Worship                                Saddleback Church Worship - Friend of God                                Saddleback Church Worship - Come To Jesus (Drama)                                                                                                Add Your Comment:            Name:                  Comment:                           Please enter the text from the image:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Copyright 2006-2009   J Gospel Net, Inc.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  He is the founder and  senior pastor  of  Saddleback Church , an evangelical  megachurch  located in  Lake Forest, California . As of January 2009 it is the eighth-largest church in the United States (this ranking includes multi-site churches). [ 4 ]  He is also a bestselling author of many  Christian  books, including his guide to church ministry and evangelism,  The Purpose Driven Church , which has spawned a series of conferences on Christian ministry and evangelism. [ citation needed ]  He is perhaps best known for the subsequent  devotional ,  The Purpose Driven Life , which has 30 million copies in print, making Warren one of the top-earning authors. [ 5 ]   Warren holds conservative  theological  views. [ 6 ]  Though maintaining traditional  evangelical  positions on issues such as  abortion  and  same-sex marriage , he has called on churches worldwide to also focus their efforts on fighting  poverty  and disease, expanding educational opportunities for the marginalized, and caring for the environment. During the  2008 United States presidential election , Warren hosted the  Civil Forum on The Presidency  at his church with both presidential candidates,  John McCain  and  Barack Obama . Then President-elect Obama later sparked controversy when he asked Warren to give the  invocation  at the  presidential inauguration , which took place on January 20, 2009.

His father was a Baptist minister, his mother a high school librarian. [ clarification needed ]  He was raised in  Ukiah, California , and graduated from Ukiah High School in 1972. His sister Chaundel is married to Saddleback pastor Tom Holladay. His brother Jim C. Warren died in 2007.   Warren received a  Bachelor of Arts  degree from  California Baptist University  in Riverside, California; a  Master of Divinity  degree from  Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary  (1979) in Fort Worth, Texas, and a  Doctor of Ministry  degree from  Fuller Theological Seminary  in Pasadena, California. [ 8 ]     Personal   Warren has been married to Elizabeth K. Warren (Kay) for 30 years. They have three adult children (Amy, Josh, and Matthew) and four grandchildren. He considers  Billy Graham ,  Peter Drucker  and his own father to be among his mentors.   Warren no longer takes a salary from Saddleback and has repaid all of his salary from the last 25 years back to the church, due to the success of his book sales. He says he now ""reverse  tithes "", meaning giving away 90% of his income and living off 10%. [ 9 ]     Career   Warren says he was called to full-time  ministry  when he was a 19-year-old student at California Baptist University. In November 1973, he and a friend skipped classes and drove 350 miles to hear  W.A. Criswell  preach at the Jack Tar Hotel, in San Francisco. [ 10 ]  Warren waited afterwards to shake hands with Criswell who focused on Warren stating ""I feel led to  lay hands on you  and pray for you! [ 10 ]   In April 1980 Warren held Saddleback Church's first public service on  Easter Sunday  at the  Laguna Hills  High School Theater with 200 people in attendance. Warren's  church growth  methods led to rapid expansion with the church using nearly 80 different facilities in its 28-year history.   Saddleback did not build its first permanent building until it had 10,000 weekly attenders. When the current Lake Forest campus was purchased in the early 1990s, a 2,300-seat plastic tent was used for worship services for several years, with four services each weekend. In 1995, the current Worship Center was completed with a seating capacity of 3,500. A multi-million dollar children's Ministry Center and staff office building were completed over the next few years. In June 2008, a $20 million student ministry facility called the ""Refinery"", was completed housing the ""Wildside"" middle school and ""HSM"" high school ministries, consisting of 1,500 students. Saddleback Church averages nearly 20,000 people in attendance each week and is currently the eighth-largest church in the United States. [ 11 ]   Warren has been invited to speak at national and international forums including the  United Nations , the  World Economic Forum  in  Davos , the  African Union , the  Council on Foreign Relations ,  Harvard s  Kennedy School of Government ,  TED , and  Time s Global Health Summit. He was named one of ""America's Top 25 Leaders"" in the October 31, 2005, issue of  U.S. News and World Report . [ 8 ]  Warren was named by  TIME magazine  as one of ""15 World Leaders Who Mattered Most in 2004"" and one of the ""100 Most Influential People in the World"" (2005). [ 12 ]  In 2006  Newsweek  called him one of ""15 People Who Make America Great"". [ 13 ]   In August 2008, Warren drew greater national attention by hosting the  Civil Forum on the Presidency  that featured senators  John McCain  and  Barack Obama  at Saddleback Church. Warren said the goal of the forum was to restore civility in our civil discourse. [ 14 ]  The forum marked McCain and Obama's first joint appearance as the presumptive  Republican  and  Democratic  presidential nominees and was broadcast live on national television. During the two-hour event, each candidate took the stage separately for about an hour to respond to Warrens questions about faith and moral issues including  abortion  and  human rights .   In December 2008, President-elect Obama chose Warren to give the invocation at his  inauguration ceremony . The decision angered  pro-choice  and  LGBT  advocates and led to criticism of both Obama and Warren. [ 15 ]  More controversy ensued when it was announced that Warren would be the keynote speaker at the  Martin Luther King, Jr.  Annual Commemorative Service on January 19, 2009, the day prior to the inauguration. [ 16 ]     Ministries   Warren and his wife are directors of the following non-profit organizations:     Acts of Mercy   RKW Legacy Partners   Equipping the Church       Purpose Driven   Purpose Driven  comes from the teaching of Warren, and came into use as a  paradigm  taught to pastors and other  Christian  leaders worldwide to help them be more effective in leading their churches. The teaching is embodied in Warrens best-selling book,  The Purpose Driven Church , first published in 1995. Over 400,000 pastors and church leaders from around the world have attended a seminar or conference led by Warren and other pastors who seek to be more effective in fulfilling the Biblical  Great Commission  and  Great Commandment . [ citation needed ]   Purpose Driven  refers to these pastors' attempts to balance the five ""purposes""; worship, fellowship, discipleship, ministry, and evangelism in their churches.   Christian leaders in 162 countries have used materials which stem from this movement. [ citation needed ]  Warren says his organizations have trained 400,000 pastors worldwide. [ 17 ]  Some 189,000 church leaders subscribe to  Ministry Toolbox , the weekly newsletter. [ citation needed ]   Others express concern over what is described as the divisive nature of Warren's techniques.  Wall Street Journal  writer Suzanne Sataline cited examples of congregations who have split over the growth strategies and congregations that have expelled members who fought changes. She wrote, ""Warren acknowledges that splits occur in congregations that adopt his ideas, though he says he opposes efforts to expel church members."" [ 17 ]     PEACE Plan       Main article:  P E A C E Plan       The P E A C E Plan is an initiative begun by Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California. Senior pastor Rick Warren's stated intention in launching the P E A C E (or PEACE) Plan is to involve every Christian and every church in every nation in the task of serving people in the areas of the greatest global needs. The tag-line is 'Ordinary people empowered by God making a difference together wherever they are'. P E A C E is an acronym for the stated methodology for achieving the plan: ""Promote reconciliation - Equip servant leaders - Assist the poor - Care for the sick - Educate the next generation."" [ citation needed ]     Political and social views          Kay and Rick Warren  (left of picture)  present  President George W. Bush , with Laura Bush at his side, with the International Medal of Peace at the Saddleback  Civil Forum  on Global Health in Washington, D.C.       Warren has worked to shift the evangelical movement away from an exclusive focus on traditional approaches [ clarification needed ]  to social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage, to broader social action instead. Warren's five-point plan for global action, the  P E A C E Plan  , calls for church-led efforts to tackle global poverty and disease, including the spread of  HIV/AIDS , and to support literacy and education efforts around the world. In February 2006, he signed a controversial statement backing a major initiative to combat  global warming , thus breaking with other conservative, high-profile evangelical leaders, such as  James Dobson , who had opposed such a move. Polls have indicated that most evangelicals are skeptical of  global warming  theories, especially related to human  culpability . This decision by Warren remains one of his most controversial and criticized moves. [ 18 ]   In a conversation with  atheist  author  Sam Harris  in  Newsweek  magazine, Warren spoke out against  evolution  and in favor of  creationism . He also said that brutal dictators such as  Mao ,  Stalin , and  Pol Pot  were all  atheists , when questioned on whether religion is beneficial to society.  [ 19 ]  Asked about the difference between himself and  Focus on the Family  founder  James Dobson , Warren claimed that ""it's a matter of tone"".  [ 20 ]  In 2005, during the  Terri Schiavo  controversy, Warren stated that withholding feeding to Schiavo, a woman in a  persistent vegetative state , was ""not a right to die issue"". He then called  Michael Schiavo 's decision to remove her feeding tube, ""an atrocity worthy of  Nazism "",  [ 21 ]  and while speculating about Michael's Schiavo's motives, put forward the idea that Schiavo wanted Terri to die because, if she regained consciousness, she might have ""something to say that he didnt want said"".  [ 22 ]   Warren has stated that  divorce  is a greater threat to the American family than gay marriage  [ 23 ] . He also publicly supported  California Proposition 8 , which amended the state constitution to read, ""Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California."" [ 24 ] [ 25 ]  After the measure passed, Warren's Saddleback Church was targeted by protesters.

Seelye                     Aretha Franklin and Dr.  Rick Warren , an evangelical minister of the Saddleback Church, are among the select group of people who will participate in Barack Obamas inaugural swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20.     Mr. Obama has also chosen Elizabeth Alexander, an African-American poet at Yale University, and some of the worlds premier musicians, including Itzhak Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma, to share the podium with him.   In honoring the civil rights movement, Mr. Obama has asked the Rev. Dr. Joseph E. Lowery, dean of the civil rights movement and co-founder with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, to deliver the benediction.   The inaugural program, which begins about 10 a.m. on the West Front of the Capitol, is an historic ritual that is both an intensely personal statement by the new president and a way for him to set the tone of his new administration.   The program was announced today by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, chaired by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.   The program opens with musical selections by the United States Marine Band, followed by the San Francisco Boys Chorus and the San Francisco Girls Chorus. Ms. Feinstein will call the gathering to order about 11:30 and deliver opening remarks.      Dr. Warren, author of “The Purpose Driven Life,” will deliver the invocation. He will be followed by Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul, who sang Someday Well All Be Free and Respect at a concert for Bill Clinton in 1993, but not at the inaugural ceremony.      Justice John Paul Stevens will then administer the oath of office to Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden, Jr.   John Williams, the composer whose music was heard at Mr. Obamas victory party on election night in Grant Park, will compose a new piece to be played for the incoming president.   His new piece will be played by Mr. Perlman on violin, Mr. Ma on cello, Gabriela Montero on piano and Anthony McGill on clarinet. (Usually at this juncture in previous inaugurations an operatic soloist performs.)   Chief Justice John G. Roberts will administer the oath of office will then be administered to President-elect Obama.      At that point, Mr. Obama will deliver his inaugural address.      He will be followed by Ms. Alexander, who will read a poem, and Dr. Lowerys benediction.      The ceremony will close with the United States Navy Band Sea Chanters singing the National Anthem.        Here are brief biographies of those who will be participating in the inaugural program, provided by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.        Elizabeth Alexander is a poet, essayist, playwright, and teacher. She is the author of four books and was a finalist for the 2005 Pulitzer Prize. She has received many grants and honors, most recently the Alphonse Fletcher, Sr. Fellowship for work that contributes to improving race relations in American society and furthers the broad social goals of the U.S. Supreme Courts Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954, and the 2007 Jackson Prize for Poetry. She is a professor at Yale University and was a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University this year.      Aretha Franklin is often described as “The Queen of Soul.” In a career spanning more than 50 years, she has earned a reputation as one of the greatest singers of our time, with a repertoire that includes soul, jazz, rock, blues, pop, and gospel. Franklin has won 21 Grammy Awards, including the Living Legend Grammy and the Lifetime Achievement Grammy. In 1987 she became the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Other awards include the National Medal of Arts, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Kennedy Center Honors.       The Reverend Dr. Joseph E. Lowery, considered the dean of the civil rights movement, co-founded along with Martin Luther King, Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and served as president and chief executive officer from 1977 to January 15, 1998. He served as pastor of Atlantas oldest predominantly Black United Methodist congregation, Central Methodist Gardens for 18 years, and as pastor of Cascade United Methodist Church from 1986 to 1992.        Anthony McGill is the principal clarinetist of the New York Metropolitan Orchestra, a member of the Peabody Conservatory faculty in clarinet, and a much sought after soloist and chamber musician. A graduate of the Curtis Institute, he is a recipient of the prestigious Avery Fisher Career Grant, a program designed to provide support for up-and-coming instrumentalists. He has performed at many music festivals, and appeared as a soloist with the symphony orchestras of Baltimore, New Jersey, and Hilton Head, and performed at Lincoln Center as a member of   Chamber Music Society Two. McGill has also toured Europe and Japan with a chamber ensemble including Mitsuko Uchida and members of the Brentano String Quartet.       Yo-Yo Ma is a world renowned cellist, educator, and ambassador for the arts. His recordings are among the most successful recordings in the classical field, and reflect his wide-ranging interest in many musical genres and traditions. He began studying the cello at age four. He studied at the Juilliard School, and is a graduate of Harvard University. His awards include the Avery Fisher Prize, the Glenn Gould Prize, and the National Medal of the Arts. Appointed a CultureConnect Ambassador by the United States Department of State in 2002, Yo-Yo Ma has met with, trained, and mentored thousands of students worldwide. In 2006, Secretary General Kofi Annan named him a U.N. Messenger of Peace, and in 2007 Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon extended his appointment.    Gabriela Montero is a pianist known both for her impeccable classical playing and her improvisational gift. Montero gave her first public performance at the age of five. At age eight she made her concert debut with the Venezuelan Youth Orchestra, and was granted a scholarship to study in the United States. At twelve she won the Baldwin National Competition and AMSA Young Artist International Piano Competition. She won the Bronze Medal at the 13th International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1995, and since then has played at recital halls and festivals around the world. Her recordings include both performances of well known classical compositions, as well as improvisations on themes by Bach and other classical composers.        Itzhak Perlman is one of the greatest violinists of our time. Following his training at the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv and the Julliard School, Perlman won the prestigious Leventritt Competition in 1964. Since then, Perlman has performed with every major orchestra throughout the world. He has also conducted orchestras including the Berlin Philharmonic, the London Philharmonic, the Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony, and the New York Philharmonic. He has won 15 Grammy Awards, four Emmy Awards, and numerous other awards including the Kennedy Center Honors, the National Medal of Arts, and the Medal of Liberty, presented by President Reagan in 1986 to honor the nations most distinguished naturalized citizens during the centennial celebration of the Statue of Liberty. Perlman is also an educator, teaching at the Perlman Music Program and the Juilliard School, where he holds the Dorothy Richard Starling Foundation Chair.      Dr. Rick Warren founded Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, in 1980 with one family. Today, it is an evangelical congregation averaging 22,000 weekly attendees, a 120-acre campus, and has more than 300 community ministries to groups such as prisoners, CEOs, addicts, single parents, and those with HIV/AIDS. He also leads the Purpose Driven Network of churches, a global coalition of congregations in 162 countries. TIME magazine named him one of 15 World Leaders Who Mattered Most in 2004, and in 2005 one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.        The San Francisco Boys Chorus (SFBC) was founded in 1948 and has become an internationally acclaimed Grammy-award winning organization. The chorus has over 240 singers from 50 Bay Area cities and more than 120 schools at three Bay Area campuses. SFBC has toured in four continents where they performed for dignitaries such as: Pope John Paul II, HRH Queen Elizabeth II of England, King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden, HM Prince of Wales, the President of the former Soviet Union, and U.S presidents. SFBC celebrated their 60 year anniversary this year.    The San Francisco Girls Chorus (SFGC) is comprised of more than 300 singers, ages 7-18, from 160 schools in 44 Bay Area cities. SFGC was founded in 1978 and has become a regional center for choral music education and performance. The Chorus can also be heard on several San Francisco Symphony recordings, including three Grammy Award-winners. In 2001, SFGC became the first youth chorus to win the prestigious Margaret Hillis Award given annually by Chorus America to a chorus that demonstrates artistic excellence, a strong organizational structure, and a commitment to education.       The United States Marine Band, founded in 1798 by an Act of Congress, is Americas oldest professional musical organization. Also called The Presidents Own, the Marine Band is celebrated for its role at the White House and its dynamic public performances. The Marine Band performs a varied repertoire including new works for wind ensemble, traditional concert band literature, challenging orchestral transcriptions, and the patriotic marches that made it famous. The band frequently features its members in solo performances that highlight their virtuosity and artistry.        The United States Navy Band “Sea Chanters” is the official chorus of the United States Navy. In 1956, Lt. Harold Fultz, then the Band’s assistant leader, organized an all male group of singers from the Navy School of Music in Anacostia for the State of the Nation dinner. The group was an instant success, so Admiral Arleigh Burke, Chief of Naval Operations, transferred them to the Navy Band, named them the Sea Chanters, and gave them the mission of carrying on the songs of the sea. Women joined the Sea Chanters in 1980. The chorus appears throughout the United States and has also sung with the Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra, the Baltimore Symphony, and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra.

After a while we started thinking that he was much too liberal for our tastes and we switched to another, more conservative church.  I’m disappointed that he’s chosen to be part of an effort to lend dignity to a PE that is already bringing Chicago-style corruption to the national scene.             — John D.                                                   4.

December 17, 2008  2:24 pm        Link                                     So has Rick Warren become the new Jeremiah Wright in Obama’s religious orbit?   Democrats need to get as far away from Warren as possible.  Pastor Rick protests that he’s not a homophobe because he’s given money to people with AIDS.  Warren claimed he supported Proposition 8 because of a free-speech issue, which is untrue: had it not passed, the free speech rights of pastors in California would have remained intact.  Warren’s argument is misleading and disingenuous.   Just two weeks ago on Fox News, Sean Hannity insisted that United States needs to “take out” Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Warren said he agreed.  Warren responded to Hannity’s question of whether he was advocating something evil or righteous by saying, “Well, actually, the Bible says that evil cannot be negotiated with. It has to just be stopped…. In fact, that is the legitimate role of government. The Bible says that God puts government on earth to punish evildoers. Not good-doers. Evildoers.”   When pressed for clarification, Warrens office said he was referring to Romans 13, which Christians told to submit to governing authorities and also addressed the power of civil government to punish criminals.  No mention of invading foreign countries and killing their leaders, which was the context of the conversation with Hannity.     Warren is not a warm and fuzzy pastor.  He is a theological and political conservative who is a litmus test pastor.   http://www.talk2action.org/story/2008/12/11/134255/16             — cab91                                                   8.

So too, many people who did not vote for Obama admire and respect Rick Warren.  President-elect Obama is completely consistent:  He has said, and he means, that he will be everyone’s President.

Do you use any powers of reason you possess?  What evidence do you know of that Obama had anything to do with pay to play with Blagojevich?  None, because there is none…But because you’re a conservative who can’t stand Obama, you throw out comments like that to smear Obama.     You know, I presume, that Blago himself said that Obama wouldn’t give him anything in return for picking someone Obama thought would be good as an Illinois senator, so why do you disregard that very credible evidence (as it was made by Blago during a recorded conversation where Blago clearly was “confessing” to his way of practicing politics).   The First Amendment gives you the right to spout off about things you don’t know about…but your effort to spread lies about Obama when he’s actually been honest and transparent in his political dealings makes you look angry, bitter, ignorant and just plain stupid.   So try to use reason rather than emotion when posting on here, as it may be more convincing.             — Steve                                                   20.

It is situated adjacent to  London Wall , the former city wall, at Broad Street.           Contents       1   History   2   References   3   See also   4   External links               [ edit ]   History   The present church was constructed by  George Dance the Younger  in 1767 [ 1 ] , replacing an earlier church built some time in the early 12th century on a bastion of the old  Roman  wall. It became renowned for its  hermits , who lived in cells in the church. All Hallows escaped destruction in the  Great Fire of London  in 1666 due to its position under the wall, but subsequently fell into dereliction.   Dance rebuilt the church when he was only 24 years old [ 2 ] . He had recently returned from  Italy  where he had conducted detailed studies of  Classical  buildings. The new All Hallows took its inspiration from the Classical world and was remarkably simple in form, with no aisles [ 3 ] ; its interior consists solely of a  barrel-vaulted   nave  with a half-dome  apse  at the far end, with decoration deriving from the ancient  Temple of Venus and Rome  in the city of  Rome . Its exterior is plain brick.   All Hallows was damaged during the  Second World War  but was restored in the early 1960s [ 4 ] . It is a  guild church  associated with the  Worshipful Company of Carpenters , which has held its annual elections in the church for over 600 years. Until 1994, it was the headquarters of the Council for the Care of Churches. It is still occasionally used for services. It is now the home for a number of charitable organisations.   The church was designated a Grade I  listed building  on 4 January 1950.

Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (February 2008)       Christians for Biblical Equality  (CBE) is  non-profit organization  of Christian men and women that advocates a biblical basis for gift-based, rather than gender-based ministry of Christians of all ages, ethnicities and socio-economic classes. Its charter, Statement of Faith, and  raison d'tre  is based on its interpretation of overarching principles of the  Bible   that  men and women are equally created  in God's image; equally responsible for sin; equally redeemed by Christ, and equally gifted by God's Spirit for service; and equally held responsible for using their God-given gifts. Founded in 1987, CBE's international home office is in  Minneapolis, Minnesota , U.S.A.   Membership is offered to both individuals and churches. Their members represent more than 80 mostly evangelical denominations from across the United States, Canada, and more than 150 countries.   The organization is an educational ministry that publishes three journals quarterly, hosts a Web site and bookstore, holds international conferences yearly, and supports grassroots chapters around the world. CBE's scholarly journal,  Priscilla Papers,  and ministry magazine,  Mutuality,  have received various publishing awards.   CBE holds that any interpretation of scripture that prohibits women from using their spiritual gifts and abilities in ministry constitutes injustice. CBE defines injustice as an abuse of power, taking from others freedom, dignity, resources, and even life itself. CBE considers gender discrimination within the church to be an injustice that harms the Christian church at large and Christian ministry in the world. The organization sees as its call to be part of God's mission in opposing injustice as required in Scriptures such as the following:           Contents       1   History   2   Conferences   3   References   4   See also   5   External links               [ edit ]   History   In 1986, the  Evangelical and Ecumenical Women's Caucus  (then the Evangelical Women's Caucus, EWCI) passed a resolution acknowledging the  lesbian  minority in its membership and affirming  homosexual rights . This led a group of more conservative members, including Catherine Kroeger, to withdraw from EWCI and affiliate with  Men, Women and God, International , based in London. In August 1987 an organization called  Men, Women and God: Christians for Biblical Equality  was incorporated in  Minnesota . The following year, the name was shortened to  Christians for Biblical Equality . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Conferences   Beginning in 1989, CBE has presented international conferencesthree-day events consisting of plenary sessions and workshops in such U.S. cities such as  St. Paul, Minnesota ,  Winter Park, Colorado ,  Wheaton, Illinois ,  San Diego, California ,  Orlando, Florida ,  Dallas, Texas   Portland, Oregon  and  Denver, Colorado . Its July 2008 conference is set for  Toronto, Canada .   International off-shore conferences were held in 2004 in  Durham, England  and  Bangalore, India , in 2007.

Complementarians interpret Scripture to teach that women and men as created equal though men are to hold ultimate authority over women in Church and the home. The use of the term complementarian is disputed, as many members of CBE consider themselves to be  Complementarians but without Hierarchy;  that is, they believe that the sexes complement each other, but they do not believe in male spiritual authority.

He had never complained at that time of the effect of that climate which proved fatal to his first wife, his children, and his best friends — one after another; but, none the less, it told its tale on him.  It was not merely in repeated attacks of illness that this was shown, but in the difficulty of writing.  His hand became cramped, and he suffered from pains in the head.  His active and comprehensive mind was full of great schemes, but he had not the physical strength to carry them out.   There is no doubt that Sir Stamford Raffles was a man of a delicate and sensitive mind, as well as of a precarious constitution.   The story of the last eighteen months of the life of Sir Stamford Raffles is a sad one; and there has seldom, if ever, been a case of a man, who had done so much for his country, passing away under such a cloud of varied misfortunes as befell him, without a contributory act of his own.  His courage and eagle spirit would no doubt have enabled him to bear up under these trials, and to have triumphed, as he had done before, over all opponents; but successive attacks, premonitory of the malady that killed him, sapped his vigour, and exhausted, with each fresh effort, the remaining powers of his body.   The following extracts from his correspondence with Dr Raffles will show the reader how much he suffered during the last year of his life.  On the 24th May 1825, he wrote: “Thank God I can return a tolerably satisfactory answer to your kind inquiry by saying, that though still rather weak and nervous, I am again getting about.  My attack was sudden and unexpected, but fortunately was not apoplectic, as was at first feared.  I was inanimate for about an hour, but on being bled, got better, and have had no return”; and again on 6th June, he wrote:”This last attack has so shaken my confidence and nerves, that I have hardly spirit at the present moment to enter upon public life, and prudence dictates the necessity of my keeping as quiet as I can until I completely re-establish my health.”  On the 10th Novemeber in the same year, he wrote:”I have been confined to my bed the whole of the day with one of my most violent headaches”, and on the 7th February 1826 he said,”I have, upon the whole, very much improved in my general health than I have enjoyed since my return to England… I have, however, had, and still have, a good many annoyances and inquietudes, which have occasionally disturbed my peace of mind, owing to the misconduct and distresses of friends; but I hope these will soon be over.”   The Gentleman’s Magazine, for July 1826, gives the following particulars of Sir Stamford’s death, which occurred early in the morning of the 5th of that month, the day before his forty-fifth birthday,”He had passed the preceding day in the bosom of his family, and excepting a bilious attack under which he had laboured for some days, there was ntohing in his appearance to create the least apprehension that the fatal hour was so near.  Sir Stamford had retired to rest on the Tuesday evening (4th July) between ten and eleven o’clock, his usual hour when in the country.  On the following morning at 5 0′clock, it being discovered that he had left his room before the time at which he generally rose, 6 0′clock, Lady Raffles immediately rose, and found him lying at the bottom of a flight of stairs in a state of complete insensibility.  Medical aid was promptly procured, and every means resorted to, to restore animation, but the vital spark had fled.  The body was opened, under the direction of Sir Everard Home, the same day, who pronounced his death to have been caused by an apoplectic attack, beyond the control of all human power.  It was likewise apparent that the sufferings of the decesased must, for some time past, have been most intense.”  In the course of an appreciative notice the writer concludes as follows:” Considered as a whole, the character of the late Sir T. Stamford Raffles displays little, if anything, to censure, and much to applaud.  His name will live in British History, not among warriors, but among the benefactors of mankind, as a philanthropist and statesman of the very first eminence.”        Share and Enjoy:    These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.

The primary goal was to build stronger relationships between   congregations and mission co-workers. It was also a new model and experiment   aimed at addressing our members’ changing giving patterns and upgrading our own   capacity to serve those changing needs.                  By many standards, Mission Challenge ’07 was an overwhelming   success. At the same time, we learned much from this endeavor that continues to   inform any future plans in the area of interpretation and funds development.

Small                                                               Contemporary presbyteries in North America’s Presbyterian churches are the product of influences coming from Calvin’s Geneva, by way of Knox’s Scotland, through the colonial American experience and the westward migration, to the twentieth century institutionalization of the church. Time and interaction with American individualism, free enterprise, and the managerial spirit have weakened the originating influences, although their language and forms remain. So it is worth reminding ourselves of earlier terminology and structures, not as an exercise in nostalgia, but as possible resources for the re-formation of the church.

A selection of handmade Mother's Day gifts.       Mother's Day   holiday , in the United States and Canada, celebrates motherhood generally and the positive contributions of mothers to society. It falls on the second Sunday of each May. It is the result of a campaign by  Anna Marie Jarvis  (18641948), who, following the death of her mother on May 9, 1905, devoted her life to establishing Mother's Day as a national, and later an international, holiday. The first observances of both  Mother's Day  and  Father's Day  were held in the state of  West Virginia .

These clubs also assisted both Union and Confederate encampments controlling a typhoid outbreak, and conducted a ""Mothers' Friendship Day"" to reconcile families divided by the Civil War.       The  ""Mother's Day""  anti-war observances founded by  Julia Ward Howe  in 1872 [ 2 ]     Both are sometimes claimed as the ""founder of Mother's Day,"" implying that Julia Ward Howe's June 2nd occasion and Anna Jarvis' second-Sunday-in-May event are one in the same. It is even suggested that an anti-war and feminist holiday was co-opted by the forces of sentimentality, tradition, and  Hallmark Cards . [ 3 ]  But although Mother's Day was celebrated in eighteen cities in 1873, it did not take root. It continued in Boston for about ten years under Howe's personal financial sponsorship, then died out. [ 4 ]   Julia Ward Howe's Mother's Day, celebrated on June 2nd, was first proclaimed around  1870  by  Julia Ward Howe 's Mother's Day Proclamation, and Howe called for it to be observed each year nationally in  1872 . As originally envisioned, Howe's ""Mother's Day"" was a call for  pacifism  and  disarmament  by women. See  Mother's Day Proclamation .   Early ""Mother's Day"" was mostly marked by women's peace groups. A common early activity was the meeting of groups of mothers whose sons had fought or died on opposite sides of the  American Civil War .   The first known observance of Mother's Day in the U.S. occurred in  Albion, Michigan , on  May 13 ,  1877 , [ 5 ]  the second Sunday of the month. According to local legend, Albion pioneer, Juliet Calhoun Blakeley, stepped up to complete the sermon of the Rev. Myron Daughterty, who was distraught because an anti-temperance group had forced his son and two other  temperance  advocates to spend the night in a saloon and become publicly drunk. In the pulpit, Blakeley called on other mothers to join her. Blakeley's two sons, both travelling salesmen, were so moved that they vowed to return each year to pay tribute to her and embarked on a campaign to urge their business contacts to do likewise. At their urging, in the early 1880s, the  Methodist Episcopal Church  in Albion set aside the second Sunday in May to recognize the special contributions of mothers.   On  February 4 ,  1904 ,  South Bend, Indiana  resident Frank E. Hering made the first Public Plea and started his own campaign for a national observance of ""Mother's Day"" in  Indianapolis, Indiana .     [ edit ]   Jarvis's Mother's Day   In  1907 , Mother's Day was first celebrated in a small, private way by  Anna Marie Jarvis  in  Grafton, West Virginia , to commemorate the anniversary of her mother's death two years earlier on  May 9 ,  1905 . Jarvis's mother, named  Anna Maria Reeves Jarvis , had been active in Mother's Day campaigns for peace and worker's safety and health since end of  American Civil War . The younger Jarvis launched a quest to get wider recognition of Mother's Day. The celebration organized by Jarvis on  May 10 ,  1908  involved 407 children with their mothers at the Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Grafton (this church is now the Mother's Day Shrine]). Grafton is, thus, the place recognized as the birthplace of Mother's Day.   The subsequent campaign to recognize Mother's Day was financed by clothing merchant  John Wanamaker . As the custom of Mother's Day spread, the emphasis shifted from the pacifism and reform movements to a general appreciation of mothers. The first official recognition of the holiday was by  West Virginia  in 1910. A proclamation designating the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day was signed by U.S. President  Woodrow Wilson  on  May 14 ,  1914     [ edit ]   Controversy   In May 2008, most of the  Republican  representatives in Congress voted against a resolution memorializing Mother's Day, after voting for it, in an apparently mistaken procedural motion. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Current dates   The  second Sunday of May  will fall on the following dates in the next few years:     2009 - May 10   2010 - May 9   2011 - May 8   2012 - May 13   2013 - May 12   2014 - May 11      [ edit ]   References       ^  Baker, Anne Elizabeth (1854),  Glossary of Northamptonshire Words and Phrases,"" J.
