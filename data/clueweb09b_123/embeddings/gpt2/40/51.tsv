Their oldest traditions are steeped in methodical                  work in the fields.                  It was working the land that the Milanese put to use both the                  technique of the tenacious Certosini monks and the hydraulic inventions                  of  Leonardo da Vinci , who lived as a guest of                  the Sforza family for many years (1482-1513) and bequeathed the                  city with precious practical knowledge such as designs for irrigation                  methods in agriculture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           excerpt from page                        61                                                                                                                                                                            In the 15th century the Dominican church                  and convent of  Santa Maria delle Grazie                   was outside the medieval walls of Milan. It was in its refectory                  that, between 1495 and 1497, Leonardo painted                                                                                                                                                The Last Supper                                                     Along with the  Monna Lisa  at the Paris Louvre,  The Last                  Supper  is Leonardo's most famous work. It is one of the paintings                  most often taken as  a symbol of Western Art . It depicts                  the instant in which Jesus announces to the apostles that he knows                  one of them will betray him. Thanks to the sense of perspective                  the painting conveyed, the monks eating in the refectory almost                  had the impression they were part of the scene.                                                                      The sense of awe inspired by this masterpiece                  and the profound interest in it stem also from the enormous problems                  that its conservation has always presented. When Leonardo da Vinci                  painted  The Last Supper  he employed a technique different                  from the traditional one used to paint wall frescoes. The traditional                  technique was to divide the section of wall to be frescoed into                  small squares to be painted rapidly one at a time, while the plaster                  was still moist, so that the paint and the plaster would dry together.                  Leonardo chose a technique which resembled the one commonly employed                  to paint on canvas or on wood. This allowed him to paint more                  than once over the same surface, so that he could retouch details                  and thereby achieve the end result he had in mind.                  This method did permit Leonardo to create a wall painting of extraordinary                  beauty. Unfortunately, it is also exceptionally vulnerable because                  the color painted on dry plaster did not stick as well as it would                  have done on moist plaster and is all the more perishable.                  When this initial setback is added to the refectory's natural                  humidity, to the settling of the wall that supports the painting,                  causing cracks, and to the inevitable damage caused by the mere                  passage of hundreds of years... you will certainly understand                  why the conservation of  The Last Supper  gives rise to such                  heartfelt controversy.                                                                                                                                                                                                          Cadorna Triennale                                                                                          reopened after complete restoration                  on May 28, 1999                  open 9AM - 7PM;                                    Sunday 9AM - 8PM                  • closed Monday                                    Lire 14,000, credit cards not accepted (free for under 18 and                  senior citizens over 60)                                    visits must be booked by phone ([+39] 02 89421146) and last                  15 mins                                                                                                                                  •                                                                   Details                                                                                                                                                                                  All rights reserved                                                     copyright © 1996-2003                  Monica Levy, Roberto Peretta                  copyright © 1996, 2002                  Ulrico Hoepli SpA, Milano                                                                                                                                                        [Want to  purchase                 the guidebook ?]                [Instructions on  how                to  do it]                                                                                                                                                                                           what you find pp 3-48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                what you find                          pp 49-96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                what you find                          pp 97-144                                                                                                                                                                                                                            what you find                          pp 145-212                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "

Painted by Leonardo for Duke Ludovico Sforza and his duchess Beatrice d’Este in the late 15th century, the scene represents  The Last Supper  from the final days of Jesus’s life, as narrated in the Gospel of John 13:21, when Jesus announces that one of his  Twelve apostles  would betray him.   Most visitors are intrigued by the complicated (and problematic) technique that Leonardo used in painting the scene: instead of painting on wet plaster as is usual in the creation of a fresco, the artist painted on a dry wall, sealing the stone with pitch, gesso, and mastic, and then painting on the sealing layer with tempera. As is commonly known, Leonardo’s invented technique did not work very well — it’s a conservator’s nightmare– and within a few years of completion it had already begun showing signs of deterioration.   Other visitors admire the fresco for its psychological expressions. The painting specifically portrays the reaction given by each apostle when Jesus said one of them would betray him. All twelve apostles have different reactions to the news, with various degrees of anger and shock.   Now, with the publication of a new study by art historian John Varriano in the journal  Gastronomica , visitors paying homage to  The Last Supper  can lick their lips as gaze upon the seder meal on the Leonardo’s painted table for Varriano has figured out what Jesus and his apostles are eating.   Varriano explains why scholars have commonly assumed that lamb must be the main course:   the event takes place at Passover, a time when lamb would normally be served, but scripture is silent on the menu for this particular seder. Apart from Matthew (26:20), who notes that the dinner took place in the evening, and Mark (14:15) and Luke (22:12), who add that it was held in a large room upstairs, already furnished, the biblical account could hardly be less informative when it comes to the meal itself   However, close examination of the painting made possible because of extensive restoration done in 1997 has shown that the meal was a bit fishier:   There are three large serving platters in the picture, and although the one in front of Christ is empty, the two before Andrew and Matthewthe fourth figures to his right and leftare heaped with food. The plate to our left appears to contain about half a dozen whole fish, while the one on the right is damaged to the point of being all but illegible. Fortunately, the preservation of the three small serving dishes on the right side of the composition is sufficiently good to suggest that we are looking at, in fact, sections of grilled eel garnished with orange slices.

It also plays a key role in Dan Brown's conspiracy-driven religious mythology, but most readers of  The Da Vinci Code  don't seem to realize the degree to which Brown misrepresents the painting - perhaps due to their own religious and artistic illiteracy.   Leonardo Da Vinci was an artist and as such depended upon artistic conventions. The convention was for Judas to be seated opposite the others and with his back to the viewer; here Judas is seated on the same side of the table as the others. Another absent convention was to place halos over the heads of everyone but Judas. Leonardo's painting is thus more humanistic and less religious than most: Judas the betrayer is as much a part of the group as anyone, and everyone in the group is equally human rather than saintly and holy. This reflects Leonardo's humanistic and artistic beliefs, a strong mark against anyone trying to misuse the work in grand religious conspiracy theories.   We must also understand the scriptural sources of the Last Supper. Leonardo's immediate source is John 13:21, when Jesus announces that a disciple will betray him. It is also supposed to be a depiction of the origin of the communion ritual, but scripture is conflicted on what really happened. Only Corinthians is explicit in requiring that followers repeat the ritual, for example, and only only Matthew mentions that this is done for the forgiveness of sins.   These were not news reports: just as communion differs from one denomination to the next today, it differed among early Christian communities. Local customizing of religious rituals was normal and common, so what Da Vinci is portraying is his artistic interpretation of one community's localized communion liturgy, not a news report of historical events.   Dan Brown uses the scene for it's relationship to the Holy Grail, even though John doesn't mention bread or a cup. Brown somehow concludes that the absence of a cup means the Holy Grail must be something other than a cup: the disciple John, who is really Mary Magdalene. This is no more improbable than the orthodox Christian story, but it is an almost willful misrepresentation that is believed when people don't understand the artistic and religious sources.

clueweb09-enwp01-26-04787	"                     List of paintings by Leonardo da Vinci          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                  The Last Supper       This is a  list of paintings attributed to  Leonardo da Vinci , (baptised Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci) (   pronunciation   ( help  info ) ), ( April 15 ,  1452    May 2 ,  1519 ), one of the leading artists of the  High Renaissance . Fifteen works are generally attributed either in whole or in large part to him, most of them paintings on panel but including a mural, a large drawing on paper and two works in the early stages of preparation. A further six paintings are disputed, there are four recently attributed works, and two are copies of lost work. None of Leonardo's paintings are signed, and this list draws on the opinions of various scholars. [ 1 ]   The small number of surviving paintings is due to Leonardo's constant and frequently disastrous experimentation with new techniques, and his chronic procrastination. Nevertheless, these few works together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, comprise a contribution to later generations of artists rivaled only by that of his contemporary,  Michelangelo .

[ 2 ]  It is generally considered that Leonardo also painted much of the background landscape and the torso of Christ. One of Leonardo's earliest extant works. Vasari's statement that the angel on the left is by Leonardo is confirmed by studies by  Bode , Seidlitz and Guthman, and accepted by McCurdy, Wasserman and others.

The work was traditionally attributed to Verrocchio until 1869. It is now almost universally attributed to Leonardo. Attribution proposed by Liphhart, accepted by Bode, Lubke, Muller-Walde,  Berenson ,  Clark , Goldscheider and others.

The anatomy of the Christ Child is so poor as to discourage firm attribution by most critics while some believe that it is a work of Leonardo's youth. This attribution was made by Suida in 1929. Other art historians such as Shearman and Morelli attribute the work to Verrocchio. [ 1 ]  Daniel Arasse discusses this painting as a youthful work in  Leonardo da Vinci , (1997).

Early 20th-century scholars were vociferous in their disagreement, but most current critics accept both the authorship and the identity of the sitter.

Several gods and goddesses were connected with music and      dance and the very word music comes from the                 Nine Muses  of ancient Greece. They were the course of      inspiration for all artists and even today many artists speak of      their Muse.       We also have many musical terms from the Greek language:      harmony, melody, tune, choir, orchestra, chromatic, scene, lyre,      hymn, psalm, rhythm.          A common question young Greeks ask one another is ""Do you listen      to Greek or foreign music?"". They separate the two, and even      though you can like both, it is more often one or the other.      During its long journey through the ages the Greek music adapted      elements from the Romans, the Byzantium and later from the      Renaissance. In the 19th century the Greek musing is moving      forward with composers like Nikolaos Mantzaros (the composer of      the Greek National Anthem) and Spyridon Samaras the composer of      the Olympic anthem, both of those composers where from the      Ionian islands. The Ionian islands beeing closer to Italy had      affections from the Italian serenades those serenades later      became the so called ""Kantades"" of Athens of the beginning of      the 20th century. Until the 30's those songs together with the      Operettas like 'O Vaftistikos' of the composer Theofrastos      Sakelarides and the songs of Kleon Triantafylou who was known as      Attic where the most popular for the urban population of Athens      mainly. Attic was also the creator of the famous ""Mantra tou      Attic"" one of the first repertory troupes in Greece.       During the early 50s the Greek music, or certainly what you      could hear in the mass media of radio and films, was the Laika      (music based on the bouzouki) with sounds that the Greeks from      Asia Minor brought with them back in the 1920s. The Greek soft      music (elafra mousiki) with flavours of western European sounds,      the most representative of which came from the songs of Manos      Hadjidakis and Mimis Plessas that was sung by famous performers      like Nana Moushouri, Tzeni Vanou, Giannis Vogiatzis and others,      was also very popular. Also, during this time, the music of      famous duos and trios like the Katsamba Brothers and Trio Athena      became fashionable. Their particular sound was an imitation of      Spanish and Mexican music which they transformed into Greek. ,      As well as this, there was the other kind of music, the Demotica      or Greek folk music which unfortunately negative memories for      many older Greeks as Demotica was promoted as Greek nationalist      music during the seven years under the dictatorship. Hopefully,      as the years have gone by, these bad connotations are beginning      to fade.              Laika developed from the Rebetika which was popular among the      underclasses during the 1940s and 1950s. It was not well known      to the masses until around the 1970s when George Dalaras and      many others reproduced many old Rebetica songs. This coincided      with the making of the famous Greek film, Rebetico (that tells      the story of Marika Ninou one of the first rebetiko woman      singers) which popularised this kind of music even more. The      Laika was, for many years, neglected by the Greek middle class.      It is said that it was Manolis Hiotis who brought the bouzouki      music into the middle-class drawing room. Manolis Hiotis was      probably the best virtuoso of the bouzouki though he was a      former guitarist, he also invented the eight string bouzouki and      created unforgettable songs using for the first time in modern      Greek pop music the styles of Jazz, Samba and many Latin music      elements integrated with his bouzouki.              From the end of the 1950s onwards, the Greek Laika became more      and more popular. This is partly to do with the economic      development of Greece that was slowly recovering from the two      wars, the Second World War and the Civil War. More and more      Greeks could afford to buy radios and record players. The Greek      record companies, seeing the potential of Laika, signed      contracts with singers, musicians and composers and the mass      production of popular Greek music really began to take off.             Throughout the 1960s saw the growth of the well-known tavernas      that offered live music shows, the Bouzoukia. This occurred      particularly in areas of Athens. One of the most fashionable      area at the time was Tzitzifies. The 1960s saw the absolute      domination of Laika. Great performers became known to all Greek      households. Names such as Grigoris Bithikotsis, Stelios      Kazantzidis, Stamatis Kokotas, Manolis Angelopoulos, Marinela,      Giota Lidia, Doukisa, Poly Panou, Panos Cavalas with Ria Kourti,      Viky Mosholiou were all singing the songs of famous composers      like Vasilis Tsitsanis, Giannis Papaioannou, Markos Vamvakaris,      Giorgos Zambetas, Giorgos Mitsakis, Apostolos Kardaras and many      others.            There is a big dispute about what is considered as Greek popular      music during those days because, as is well known in the modern      Greek music world, many composers of those years were tuning      their radios every night to the short wave frequencies and      listening to the music from several Arabian countries as well as      India. The music they then went on to compose was highly      influenced (and in some cases even copied) from songs of these      countries. I can recall personally that, back in the 1980s, I      was playing in a Greek folk band where we had amongst our      members a bouzouki player who was Iranian. He taught us a famous      Persian folk song (Masta) which, some years later became a top      hit in Greece but played by a completely different Greek band.      Many they say that authentic Greek folk music was developed      firstly by Marcos Vamvakaris, with his famous song Fragosyriani      . With this song Vamvakaris introduces new musical roots with      more Western sounds that blend perfectly with the old sounds of      Rebetiko. The same happens also with Vasillis Tsitsanis and his      song Omorfi Thessaloniki. Both these songs are the typical      Hasapiko dance songs. Finally, there is George Zambetas with the      song Syko Horepse       Syrtaki which seals a whole era that follows with the name      'Greek tourist music'. At this point it is interesting to      mention that during the 1960s The Beatles were said to have      visited Greece and met with Zambetas to learn some of the      techniques of Greek music and bouzouki. It is not strange      therefore that, to the Greek ear, the Beatles' song 'Girl' is a      typical Greek Hasapiko.                                                                    In the middle of the 1960s a new kind of music began to be heard      in Greece. this was the Greek New Wave music which was inspired      by Western ballads and styles that were first introduced in      Paris in the Boifes music halls. the New Wave became the      favourite music style of the young Greek intellectuals and      sophisticates. The Buite Esperides of Yiannis Argyris and      Apanemia of George Zografos, both in Plaka in Athens, became the      shrines of this New Wave. It was the time of great performers      like Dionyssis Sourpopoulos to make a huge turnaround in the      Greek music scene developing it towards Western ballads, Blues      and Rock. During this time new performers of the Greek new wave      like Giannis Poulopoulos, Kostas Hadjis, Arleta and others make      a significant presence.            Of course, the composers that made the Greek music known      internationally are Mikis Theodorakis with his famous Zorba the      Greek Manos Hadzidakis with Never on Sunday , and Stavros      Xarhakos with his music in the film The Red Lights. These three      composers are acknowledge as the greatest composers of modern      Greece and you will often hear their names mentioned in musical      circles as 'the fat' (Hiadjidakis) 'the tall' (Theodorakis) and      'the short' (Xarhakos). Of course, we should not forget another      great composer, Vangelis Papathanasiou, who left Greece with      Demis Roussos in the late 1960s to set up the famous group,      Aphrodite's Child, in Paris France which was the beginning of      their international careers.            From the 1970s and 1980s onwards, the Greek music became more      and more distant from the original sounds of the 1950s and 60s.      This decade saw the introduction of new sounds, digital      recordings with sound effects and the absolute domination of the      synthesiser keyboard pushing away the original folk instruments      of 25 years before and, in particular, delegating the bouzouki      sound to a backing role.

Last Supper, 1495-98. Tempera and mixed media on plaster. 460 x 880 cm (15.09 x 28.87 ft.). Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan             Why did Leonardo paint this?     Because his employer requested he do so. Leonardo worked for Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, for nearly eighteen years (1482-99). The Duke decided he wanted this particular religious scene painted and Leonardo, who was  not  stupid, decided painting it made perfect financial sense.    How big is it?    It's huge, really - 460 x 880 cm (15 x 29 feet). It covers an entire large wall, very unlike reproductions sized to hang neatly behind one's sofa.    Where is it?    The original mural is on a wall of the refectory (dining hall) in the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy.    If you'd care to see a reproduction or fifty, they're easily found. As an image,  Last Supper  has been put on everything from mirrors, to mouse pads, to musical pillows. If Leonardo were still around, he'd be earning billions of (insert your currency here) on licensing fees alone.    How long did it take Leonardo to paint this?    He began working on it in 1495, and finished  Last Supper  in 1498. This is worth noting, as Leonardo was a known procrastinator with a marked tendency to leave projects unfinished.     Why is the composition remarkable?    First, because the disciples are all displaying very human, identifiable emotions. ""The Last Supper"" had certainly been painted before. Leonardo's version, though, was the first to depict real people  acting like  real people.    Secondly, and of major importance - the technical perspective in  Last Supper  is incredible! You can see that every single element of the painting directs one's attention straight to the midpoint of the composition, Christ's head. It's arguably the greatest example of one point perspective ever created.    What does  Last Supper  depict?    Last Supper  is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the  Eucharist , a ritual still performed.    Specifically,  Last Supper  depicts the next few seconds in this story  after  Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger and shock.    Who's in it?    Looking across the picture from left to right:      Bartholomew, James Minor  and  Andrew  form a group of three. All are aghast, Andrew to the point of holding his hands up in a ""stop!"" gesture.       Judas, Peter  and  John  form the next group of three. Judas, you will note, has his face in shadow and is clutching a small bag (of silver?). Peter is visibly angry and a  feminine-looking John  seems about to swoon.      Christ  is the calm in the midst of the storm.      Thomas, James Major  and  Philip  are next. Thomas is clearly agitated, James Major stunned and Philip seems to be seeking clarification.      Matthew, Thaddeus  and  Simon  comprise the last group of three figures. It appears that, when a situation turns ugly, Simon is the ""go to"" guy for explanations.    Why is it falling apart?    Leonardo, always the inventor, tried using new materials for  Last Supper . Instead of using tempera on wet plaster (the preferred method of fresco painting, and one which had worked successfully for centuries), he thought he'd give using  dry  plaster a whirl. His experiment resulted in a more varied palette, which was Leonardo's intent. What he hadn't taken into account (because, who knew?) was that this method wasn't at all durable. The painted plaster began to flake off the wall almost immediately, and people have been attempting to restore it ever since.    Why doesn't Jesus have any feet?    Rest assured, Leonardo intended for Christ to have feet and, in fact, painted them. Around 1650, some unnamed, woefully misguided soul - on a mission to insert another door into the refectory - apparently decided that the  only  logical spot for said door was smack dab in the middle of that wall. We probably shouldn't grumble and just consider ourselves lucky that he wasn't engineering windows.    I heard this story about  Last Supper . Is it true?    Do you mean the story in which Leonardo first paints Jesus Christ, after searching many months for the perfect model? And then, years and years later, after painting all eleven other disciples, has an even more grueling search for the perfect model for Judas? And - amazingly - the  same person  ends up being the model for both? That story?    No, it's not true, and for so many reasons (all of which are detailed in a piece at  Snopes ). It's a neat bit of fiction, though, complete with a moral.    Related FAQ Gallery :  A Guide to Leonardo and Art in The Da Vinci Code .

The Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie was fully involved and in 1495, when Donato Montorfano was completing his Crucifixion for the Refectory, Leonardo was commissioned by the Duke to decorate the facing wall with a Last Supper. The commission is documented by the coats of arms that appear within plant garlands in the four lunettes above the ""Supper"" and are a reminder of the names of Ludovico, Beatrice and their children.    The Last Supper was quite slow in evolving despite the urgings of Ludovico Sforza and the prior. It actually took Leonardo about four years (1494-1498) with the dry or tempera technique he had decided to use, as if it had been a great tablet (4.60x8.80m). First of all he decided not to apply the consolidated fresco technique, which offered assurances for conservation, but was time-consuming to spread. What Leonardo required was the utmost freedom during the executive stage in order to correct, modify and achieve special color effects. Moreover, the fresco technique was irreconcilable with his bizarre temperament that led him to alternate periods of intense activity with others of total rest, as related by Matteo Bandello, who was a guest of the convent fathers and often saw Leonardo at work.    Although The Last Supper was a traditional theme used to decorate convent refectories, especially in Florence (memorable are those by Taddeo Gaddi, Beato Angelico, Andrea del Castagno and Ghirlandaio), Leonardo presented the subject in a completely innovative form. Not only did he make drastic modifications to the layout of the scene, but also the true novelty was the astounding realism with which he recounted this episode from the Gospels.

Da Vinci's  Last Supper  painting of 1498 is not a traditional true fresco ( buon fresco ) painted on wet plaster, rather it is painted on dry plaster with tempera in the   fresco secco  technique.   Da Vinci's  Last Supper  painting can be found in the  refectory  (dining hall) of the convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in       Milan, Italy. The stone wall was first prepared for Da Vinci's  Last Supper  painting by sealing the stone with pitch, mastic, and       gesso. Da Vinci's experimental technique caused rapid deterioration of the  Last Supper  painting, as it was described by  Vasari , a Leonardo biographer, as being ""ruined"" by       1556. The dry paint of Da Vinci's  Last Supper  painting was reported to already be flaking off as early as 1517, a consequence of       his experimental technique. Da Vinci's  Last Supper  painting has undergone a number of restorations, the first in 1726, and the       last in 1999 which took 21 years to finish.         Brenda Harness, Art Historian                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      QUOTE                                  OF THE                                  WEEK                                                                                                                                                The true work                                 of art is but a shadow of the                                 divine                                 perfection.                                                                             -Michelangelo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Thank you for                                       visiting                                  Fine Art                                 Touch!

Before and during the Reformation, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael,               and Michelangelo defined the Classicist art movement. However,               a disheartened Michelangelo later introduced Mannerism with the               dissonance and anxiety in his The Last Judgment. Mannerism, which               (in a way) represented the human soul during in the Reformation,               defined itself by breaking all the rules. Baroque art entered the               scene after the Reformation bringing grandeur and normality, introducing               nothing paradoxical, showing only the didactic lesson.                   The Classicists Approach to Painting                The Classicists entered on the heels of an artistic revolution,                 which was popularly known as the Renaissance and ushered in during                 the Reformation (da Vinci and Raphael died during the years Martin                 Luther was ordered to recant). The use of light, shadow, foreshortening,                 and perspective had been perfected and was at the fingertips                 of these great artists. Classicism idealized the world as it                 was and as the artist felt it. Classicism left out the extraneous                 detail to go for the truth of the matter and emphasize the noble.                 This style of painting was the first to stress a balance and                 harmony in art and nature. Furthermore, it was subsidized by                 the Pope primarily for the painting of his chapel and by the                 rich Italian families that wanted to have that which the Church                 had.                   Da Vinci, even with his unexplainable dissonance, mastered the               harmonious in his paintings as he used space to even out The Holy               Family with St. Anne and The Madonna of the Rocks. The Last Supper               portrays Jesus standing out, not because he is at the center of               the painting, but because he represents calm in a chaotic time.                   Raphael's School of Athens borrowed from da Vinci's The Last Supper               in its arrangement of characters. However, Raphael chose to show               the classical thinkers of Greece and Rome vice da Vinci's Christ               and the Twelve. He displayed them modestly, each in a pose that               epitomized the individual. Sister Madonna continued such modesty               and gave nobility to The Virgin Mary that had never before been               seen.                   Michelangelo would be arguably the most powerful of the classists,               unintentionally influencing the Mannerist movement with his anxious               painting. This talented sculptor, painter, architect, and poet               would finish the Sistine Chapel ceiling in less than five years               (1508-1512). His painting on this ceiling was an extraordinary               accomplishment, portraying the anatomically correct human body               in any position. His Holy Family featured more motion in a smaller               space, with figures looking almost sculpted, like Greek gods. In               1534, he completed The Last Judgment. At the peak of the Protestant               Reformation, this painting displayed the dissonance, anxiety and               chaos ripping at the church's fabric. In doing so, it gave rise             to an art movement that had already begun to rumble - Mannerism.

Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) is one of the most intriguing personalities in the history of Western art.  Trained in Florence  as a painter and sculptor in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio (1435–1488), Leonardo is also celebrated for his  scientific  contributions. Leonardo's curiosity and insatiable hunger for knowledge never left him. He was constantly observing, experimenting, and inventing, and drawing was, for him, a tool for recording his investigation of nature. Although completed works by Leonardo are few, he left a large body of  drawings  (almost 2,500) that record his ideas, most still gathered into notebooks. He was principally active in Florence (1472–ca. 1482, 1500–1508) and  Milan  (ca. 1482–99, 1508–13), but spent the last years of his life in Rome (1513–16) and  France  (1516/17–1519), where he died. His genius as an artist and inventor continues to inspire artists and scientists alike centuries after his death.

He recorded his constant flow of ideas for paintings on paper. In his  Studies for the Nativity  (17.142.1) , he studied different poses and gestures of the  mother and her infant , probably in preparation for the main panel in his famous altarpiece known as the  Virgin of the Rocks  (Paris, Louvre). Similarly, in a sheet of designs for a stage setting ( Allegorical Design , verso, 17.142.2) , prepared for a staging of a masque (or musical comedy) in Milan in 1496, he made notes on the actors' positions on stage alongside his sketches, translating images and ideas from his imagination onto paper. Leonardo also drew what he observed from the world around him, including  human anatomy , animal and plant life, the motion of water, and the flight of birds. He also investigated the mechanisms of machines used in his day, inventing many devices like a modern-day engineer. His drawing techniques range from rather rapid pen sketches, in the  Head of a Man in Profile to Left  (10.45.1) , to carefully finished drawings in red and black chalks, as in the  Head of the Virgin  (51.90) . These works also demonstrate his fascination with physiognomy, and contrasts between youth and old age, beauty and ugliness.    The Last Supper  (ca. 1492/94–1498)   Leonardo's  Last Supper , on the end wall of the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, is one of the most renowned paintings of the High Renaissance. Recently restored,  The Last Supper  had already begun to flake during the artist's lifetime due to his failed attempt to paint on the walls in layers (not unlike the technique of tempera on panel), rather than in a true  fresco technique . Even in its current state, it is a masterpiece of dramatic narrative and subtle pictorial illusionism.   Leonardo chose to capture the moment just after Christ tells his apostles that one of them will betray him, and at the institution of the Eucharist. The effect of his statement causes a visible response, in the form of a wave of emotion among the apostles. These reactions are quite specific to each apostle, expressing what Leonardo called the ""motions of the mind."" Despite the dramatic reaction of the apostles, Leonardo imposes a sense of order on the scene. Christ's head is at the center of the composition, framed by a halo-like architectural opening. His head is also the vanishing point toward which all lines of the perspectival projection of the architectural setting converge. The apostles are arranged around him in four groups of three united by their posture and gesture. Judas, who was traditionally placed on the opposite side of the table, is here set apart from the other apostles by his shadowed face.    Mona Lisa  (ca. 1503–6 and later)   Leonardo may also be credited with the most famous  portrait  of all time, that of Lisa, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and known as the  Mona Lisa  (Paris, Louvre). An aura of mystery surrounds this painting, which is veiled in a soft light, creating an atmosphere of enchantment. There are no hard lines or contours here (a technique of painting known as  sfumato — fumo  in Italian means ""smoke""), only seamless transitions between light and dark. Perhaps the most striking feature of the painting is the sitter's ambiguous half smile. She looks directly at the viewer, but her arms, torso, and head each twist subtly in a different direction, conveying an arrested sense of movement. Leonardo explores the possibilities of  oil paint  in the soft folds of the drapery, texture of skin, and contrasting light and dark (chiaroscuro). The deeply receding background, with its winding rivers and rock formations, is an example of Leonardo's personal view of the natural world: one in which everything is liquid, in flux, and filled with movement and energy.

His renown primarily rests upon his brilliant achievements as a painter, the  Mona Lisa  and the  Last Supper , being two of the most famous artworks ever created, but also upon his diverse skills as a scientist and inventor. He became so highly valued during his lifetime that the King of France bore him home like a  trophy of war , supported him in his old age and, according to legend, cradled his head as he died.   Leonardo's portrait was used, within his own lifetime, as the iconic image of  Plato  in  Raphael 's  School of Athens . His biography was written in superlative terms by  Vasari . He has been repeatedly acclaimed the greatest genius to have lived. His painting of the  Mona Lisa  has been the most imitated artwork of all time and his drawing of the  Vitruvian Man  iconically represents the fusion of Art and Science.   Leonardo's biography has appeared in many forms, both scholarly and fictionalised. Every known aspect of his life has been scrutinised and analysed. His paintings, drawings and notebooks have been studied, reproduced and analysed for five centuries. The interest in and appreciation of the character of Leonardo and his talents has never waned.   Leonardo has appeared in many  fictional  works, such as  novels ,  television shows  and  movies , the first such fiction dating from the 16th century. Various characters have been named after him.

It has been suggested that it is Leonardo's portrait of his father or grandfather. On the other hand, an explanation that has been put forward to explain the apparent advanced age of the individual is that Leonardo deliberately drew himself as older than he really was, in order that  Raphael  might use it as the basis for his depiction of Leonardo as Plato in the  School of Athens .   The drawing has been the basis for other representations of Leonardo.           Mnageot 's  The Death of Leonardo da Vinci         [ edit ]   Death of Leonardo   The story of Leonardo dying in the arms of the French king  Francis I , although apochryphal [ 1 ] , appealed to French history painters of the 18th and 19th centuries.     [ edit ]   Mnageot's version   Mnageot  painted  The Death of Leonardo da Vinci in the arms of Francis I  in  1781 , setting it in a background of classical statuary. This included a portrayal of the  Borghese Gladiator  (Mnageot probably having seen it at the  Villa Borghese  during his stay at the  French Academy in Rome  from 1769 to 1774), although this was an anachronism since Leonardo died in  1519 , about ninety years before the statue was discovered.           The Death of Leonardo  by Ingres, 1818.         [ edit ]   Ingres' version   In 1818 the French painter  Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres  depicted the scene of Leonardo's death which is shown taking place in the home ""Clos Luce"" provided for him at Blois by King  Francis I . The King is shown supporting Leonardo's head as he dies, as described by  Vasari , watched by the  Dauphin  who is comforted by a cardinal. A distraught young man may represent Leonardo's pupil Melzi.   The treatment of this subject by Ingres is indicative of Leonardo's iconic status and also specifically that he was of particular significance to the school of French Classicism. A number of his paintings had passed into the Royal collection and certain elements of them were much imitated. Leonado's manner of soft shading known as ""sfumato"" was particularly adapted by Ingres,  Jacques Louis David  and their followers. An influential painting was  Leda and the swan , now regarded as by a pupil of Leonardo but then generally accepted as the master's work.

(June 2008)         [ edit ]   In fiction     [ edit ]   Novels and short stories     The Second Mrs. Giaconda  (1981) by  E. L. Konigsburg  is a story about why Leonardo painted the  Mona Lisa .   Theodore Mathieson 's short story  Leonardo Da Vinci: Detective  portrays him using his genius to solve a murder during his time in France.   The novel  Pasquale's Angel  by  Paul J. McAuley , set in an  alternate universe  Florence, portrays Leonardo as ""the Great Engineer"", creating a premature  industrial revolution  (see  clockpunk ).   The novel  The Memory Cathedral  by  Jack Dann  is a fictional account of a ""lost year"" in the life of Leonardo. Dann has his genius protagonist actually create his flying machine.   The novel  Pilgrim  by  Timothy Findley  describes the encounters of an immortal named Pilgrim with Leonardo da Vinci among others, as told to  Carl Jung .   Terry Pratchett 's character  Leonard of Quirm  is a  pastiche  of Leonardo.   Three novels by  Martin Woodhouse  and Robert Ross feature the adventures of Leonardo da Vinci in the guise of a  James Bond -type spy of the Italian Renaissance:  The Medici Guns  (1974);  The Medici Emerald  and  The Medici Hawks .   The Secret Supper  (2006) by Javier Sierra explores the symbology of Leonardo's  Last Supper , and its threat to the Catholic Church, as he is painting the fresco in 15th century Milan.   Black Madonna  (1996) by  Carl Sargent  and  Marc Gascoigne , is set in the  Shadowrun  game universe and portrays Leonardo as still living in the 21st century, blackmailing corporations to finance his inventions.   The Medici Seal , a children's novel by  Theresa Breslin  (2006).   In the  Children of the Red King  series, a Donatella Di Vinci married a Bertram Babbington-Bloor. Donatella was the daughter of an Italian magician. No connection between Leonardo and Donatella has been stated since.   In Robert Heinlen's The Door Into Summer, Dr. Twitchell recounts a tale of a student whom he displaced in time by 500 years. While there was no way of knowing whether the student went to the past or the future, Dr. Twitchell hints that he believes it was the past due to the student's name -- Leonard Vincent.       [ edit ]   The Da Vinci Code   This work of fiction has been the centre of controversy over the accuracy of its depictions of Christianity and of Leonardo.   A bestselling 2003 novel by  Dan Brown , adapted and released as a major  motion picture  in 2006,  The Da Vinci Code  revolves around a conspiracy based on elements of Leonardo's  Last Supper  and other works. A preface to the novel claims that depictions of artworks, secret societies and rites described within the novel are factual. For this reason much of the content of the novel has been widely accepted by readers as authoritative. Because the theme involves a conspiracy within the  Church  over the life of  Jesus  and the suggestion that the Church has hidden the facts of his marriage, there has been a strong reaction against the novel and much material published examining and refuting its claims.   Within the novel it is claimed that from 1510-1519, Leonardo was the Grand Master of a secret society, the  Priory of Sion . In reality this society existed only as a 20th century hoax, but author Dan Brown used as a source the 1982  pseudohistory  book  The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail . The writers of this book had based their research on forged medieval documents that had been created as part of the Priory of Sion fraud. The mix of fact and fiction in the documents made it difficult to discount immediately as a forgery. For example, it was claimed that the Grand Master prior to Leonardo was  Botticelli , who had indeed had an association with Leonardo, as they were both students at the Florence workshop of  Andrea del Verrocchio .   The Priory of Sion story and the veracity of  The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail  was eventually debunked, and many of those involved publicly recanted, although Dan Brown continued to assert that the facts as presented were true.   In portraying the Priory of Sion as ""fact""  The Da Vinci Code  expanded on the claims in  The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail :     That there were additional secrets hidden in Leonardo's paintings, such as an ""M"" letter in the painting of  The Last Supper , indicating the presence of  Mary Magdalene  and that the figure to the left of Jesus traditionally said to represent  John the Evangelist  actually represents  Mary Magdalene .   That Leonardo's painting  The Mona Lisa  was actually a self-portrait.   That among the differences in the two versions of the painting of the  Virgin of the Rocks  which hang in the  Louvre  and London's  National Gallery , is the fact that in the Louvre painting the baby to the left of the picture depicts  Jesus , and to the right  John the Baptist , rather than the accepted view, which is the other way round.   That Leonardo invented a  cryptex  for carrying secret messages.     The book also used a variation of Leonardo's backwards handwriting to hide a secret message on the American bookjacket.   Among the many criticisms of Brown's writing is that he uses the name da Vinci (meaning ""from Vinci"") in the manner that surnames are commonly used nowadays. Leonardo would never have been referred to simply as  da Vinci  in his lifetime. Such designations were appended to common baptismal names in order to identify individuals.     [ edit ]   Movies     Ever After  from 1998 starring  Drew Barrymore  and  Patrick Godfrey  as Leonardo da Vinci.   Hudson Hawk  starring  Bruce Willis  and  Danny Aiello  revolves around Leonardo da Vinci's inventions.

David Davalos's 2002 play  Daedalus  tells a fantasized story of Leonardo's time as a military engineer in the service of Cesare Borgia.       [ edit ]   Music     Author Charles Anthony Silvestri and composer  Eric Whitacre  collaborated to create an ""opera brve"" based on text from da Vinci's journals and original text by Silvestri. This piece,  Leonardo Dreams of His Flying Machine,  was modeled after da Vinci's conceptual flying machine. This piece was written on commission by the  American Choral Directors Association  as the second piece in Whitacre's series of ""Element Works,"" the first being  Cloudburst , written in 1992.       [ edit ]   Television fiction     In the anime OVA: 'Mask of Zeguy' Leonardo da Vinci was one of the antagonists who sought out the Crown of Shamus in order to prevent Himiko from using her powers to open the Gate of Winds, because his inventions (i.e. dangerous weapons) will become useless.   In  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!  live-action segment ""The Painting"", the Mario Bros. find a painting which happens to be Leonardo da Vinci's painting "" The Last Supper "". They call up Howard Stevens (played by the show's producer  Andy Heyward ), and he explains that it's the ""second Last Supper"" by Leonardo da Vinci ""Rooney"". However, upon further examination, they discover that the painting is actually worthless because it was painted by an impostor, Leonard da Vinci ""Mahoney"". Howard was able to identify it as Mahoney's painting because one of the people in the painting is Mahoney's uncle,  Roy Orbisoni Mahoney . The information dealing with da Vinci in this episode is incorrect.   In the  Star Trek: The Original Series  episode "" Requiem for Methuselah "", Leonardo da Vinci is revealed to be one of many aliases to ""Flint"", an immortal man born in the year 3834 BC. Leonardo's abilities and knowledge are thus attributed to centuries of scientific and artistic study. Leonardo appears again in the Star Trek universe, in the series  Star Trek: Voyager , where his workshop is created as a  holographic  simulation. Actor  James Daly  played Flint/Leonardo in  Star Trek: The Original Series , while  John Rhys-Davies  portrayed Leonardo in  Star Trek: Voyager . Also, in the S.C.E. ( Starfleet Corps of Engineers ) novellas, the main starship of the series is called the  U.S.S. da Vinci  (NCC-81623), a Sabre-class vessel, named for the artist.   The 1979  Doctor Who  story  City of Death  features a theft of the  Mona Lisa .  The Doctor  goes back in time to visit Leonardo's workshop and claims to be an old acquaintance of the artist. Leonardo also appears as a character in several  Doctor Who  novels.   The cartoon  The Tick  features Leonardo in ""Leonardo DaVinci and his Fightin' Genius Time Commandos!"" (Season 2, Episode 17, 1995) in which a number of famous inventors are brought to the present by an inventor seeking to take credit for their work. (Other inventors include Ben Franklin, George Washington Carver, and the neolithic inventor of the wheel, named Wheel.) Leonardo is portrayed as being able to create fantastic flying devices about of rudimentary objects.   The television show  Alias  features a character  Milo Giacomo Rambaldi , a fictional character clearly based on Leonardo.

He reveals that he discovered immortality centuries ago through the invention of the  fountain of youth .   An episode of  Histeria!  focusing on  the Renaissance  featured a cartoon caricature of Leonardo as a host. Over the course of the episode, he is criticized by  World's Oldest Woman  for  wearing a dress , and also parodies  the 1960s  Batman  series  as Renaissance Man, with  Loud Kiddington  as his sidekick.

Leonardo da Vinci   Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor,  architect, author, engineer, inventor,  lutanist, mathematician & scientist  born 15 April 1452 - died 1519  Born in: Vinci (Florentine province,  Tuscany, Italy).  Died in: Amboise (Indre-et-Loire, France).   Also known as: Lonard de Vinci, Leonardo  d'Avinci, Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci.         Student of:    Andrea del Verrocchio   (1435-1488).   Teacher of:   Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio   (1466-1516),  Andrea  Solario  (1460-1524).   Uncle of:  Pierino  da Vinci  (1531-1554).   Rival of:    Michelangelo  (1475-1564).     Leonardo da Vinci was a Florentine artist,  one of the great masters of the High  Renaissance, who was also celebrated as a  painter, sculptor, architect, engineer, and  scientist. His profound love of knowledge  and research was the keynote of both his  artistic and scientific endeavors. His  innovations in the field of painting  influenced the course of Italian art for  more than a century after his death, and his  scientific studiesparticularly in the  fields of anatomy, optics, and  hydraulicsanticipated many of the  developments of modern science.       Leonardo da Vinci was born in the small town  of Vinci, in Tuscany, near Florence.  Leonardo da Vinci was  the son of a wealthy Florentine notary and a  peasant woman. In the mid-1460s the family  settled in Florence, where Leonardo was  given the best education that Florence, a  major intellectual and artistic center of  Italy, could offer. Leonardo da Vinci rapidly advanced socially and  intellectually. Leonardo da Vinci was  handsome, persuasive in conversation, and a  fine musician and improviser. About 1466  Leonardo da Vinci was apprenticed as a  garzone (studio boy) to    Andrea del Verrocchio ,  the leading Florentine painter and sculptor  of his day. In Verrocchio's workshop  Leonardo was introduced to many activities,  from the painting of altarpieces and panel  pictures to the creation of large sculptural  projects in marble and bronze. In 1472  Leonardo da Vinci was entered in the  painter's guild of Florence, and in 1476 biografia de leonardo da Vinci was still considered Verrocchio's assistant.  In Verrocchio's Baptism of Christ (1470?,  Uffizi, Florence), the kneeling angel at the  left of the painting is by Leonardo.    In 1478 he became an  independent master. His first commission, to  paint an altarpiece for the chapel of the  Palazzo Vecchio, the Florentine town hall,  was never executed. His first large  painting, The Adoration of the Magi (begun  1481, Uffizi), left unfinished, was ordered  in 1481 for the Monastery of San Donato a  Scopeto, Florence. Other works ascribed to  his youth are the so-called Benois Madonna  (1478?, Hermitage, Saint Petersburg), the  portrait Ginevra de' Benci (1474?, National  Gallery, Washington, D.C.), and the  unfinished Saint Jerome (1481?, Pinacoteca,  Vatican).  About 1482 he entered the  service of the duke of Milan, Ludovico  Sforza, having written the duke an  astonishing letter in which Leonardo da  Vinci stated that he could build portable bridges; that  Leonardo da Vinci knew the techniques of  constructing bombardments and of making  cannons; that he could build ships as well  as armored vehicles, catapults, and other  war machines; and that he could execute  sculpture in marble, bronze, and clay.  Leonardo da Vinci served as principal  engineer in the duke's numerous military  enterprises and was active also as an  architect. In addition, he  assisted the Italian mathematician Luca  Pacioli in the celebrated work Divina  Proportione (1509). - he oil painting, da Vinci paintings Italy - Bio oil  painting Italy - art of oil painting by daVinci oil painting supplier of he oil paintings, Italy oil painting da Vinci The Last Supper.     Evidence indicates that Leonardo had  apprentices and pupils in Milan, for whom  Leonardo da Vinci probably wrote the various texts later  compiled as Treatise on Painting (1651;  translated 1956). The most important of his  own paintings during the early Milan period  was The Virgin of the Rocks, two versions of  which exist (1483-1485, Louvre, Paris; 1490s  to 1506-1508, National Gallery, London);  Leonardo da Vinci worked on the compositions  for a long time, as was his custom,  seemingly unwilling to finish what Leonardo  da Vinci had  begun. From 1495 to 1497 Leonardo labored on  his masterpiece, The Last Supper, a mural in  the refectory of the Monastery of Santa  Maria delle Grazie, Milan. Unfortunately,  his experimental use of oil on dry plaster  (on what was the thin outer wall of a space  designed for serving food) was technically  unsound, and by 1500 its deterioration had  begun. Since 1726 attempts have been made,  unsuccessfully, to restore it; a concerted  restoration and conservation program, making  use of the latest technology, was begun in  1977 and is reversing some of the damage.  Although much of the original surface is  gone, the majesty of the composition and the  penetrating characterization of the figures  give a fleeting vision of its vanished  splendor.          During his long stay in Milan, Leonardo also  produced other paintings and drawings (most  of which have been lost), theater designs,  architectural drawings, and models for the  dome of Milan Cathedral. His largest  commission was for a colossal bronze  monument to Francesco Sforza, father of  Ludovico, in the courtyard of Castello  Sforzesco. In December 1499, however, the  Sforza family was driven from Milan by  French forces; Leonardo left the statue  unfinished (it was destroyed by French  archers, who used the terra cotta model as a  target) and he returned to Florence in 1500.    In 1502 he entered the  service of Cesare Borgia, duke of Romagna  and son and chief general of Pope Alexander  VI. In his capacity as the duke's chief  architect and engineer, he  supervised work on the fortresses of the  papal territories in central Italy. In 1503  Leonardo da Vinci was a member of a commission of artists  who were to decide on the proper location  for the David (1501-1504, Accademia,  Florence), the famous colossal marble statue  by the Italian sculptor Michelangelo, and  Leonardo da Vinci also served as an engineer in the war  against Pisa. Toward the end of the year  Leonardo da Vinci began to design a  decoration for the great hall of the Palazzo  Vecchio. The subject was the Battle of  Anghiari, a Florentine victory in its war  with Pisa. Leonardo da Vinci made many  drawings for the decoration and completed a  full-size cartoon, or sketch, in 1505, but  Leonardo da Vinci never finished the wall painting. The  cartoon itself was destroyed in the 17th  century, and the composition survives only  in copies, of which the most famous is the  one by the Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens  (1615?, Louvre).      During this second Florentine period,  Leonardo da Vinci painted several portraits,  but the only one that survives is the famous  Mona Lisa (1503-1506, Louvre). One of the  most celebrated portraits ever painted, it  is also known as La Gioconda, after the  presumed name of the woman's husband.  Leonardo da Vinci seems to have had a  special affection for the picture, for  Leonardo da Vinci took it with him on all of his subsequent  travels.    In 1506  again went to  Milan, at the summons of its French  governor, Charles d'Amboise. The following  year he was named court painter to King  Louis XII of France, who was then residing  in Milan. For the next six years Leonardo  divided his time between Milan and Florence,  where he often visited his half brothers and  half sisters and looked after his  inheritance. In Milan he continued his  engineering projects and worked on an  equestrian figure for a monument to Gian  Giacomo Trivulzio, commander of the French  forces in the city; although the project was  not completed, drawings and studies have  been preserved. From 1514 to 1516 Leonardo  lived in Rome under the patronage of Pope  Leo X. Leonardo da Vinci was housed in the Palazzo  Belvedere in the Vatican and seems to have  been occupied principally with scientific  experimentation. In 1516   traveled to France to enter the service of  King Francis I.

Although he produced a  relatively small number of paintings, many  of which remained unfinished, Leonardo da  Vinci was nevertheless an extraordinarily  innovative and influential artist. During  his early years, his style closely  paralleled that of Verrocchio, but Leonardo  da Vinci gradually moved away from his teacher's  stiff, tight, and somewhat rigid treatment  of figures to develop a more evocative and  atmospheric handling of composition. The  early painting The Adoration of the Magi  introduced a new approach to composition, in  which the main figures are grouped in the  foreground, while the background consists of  distant views of imaginary ruins and battle  scenes.    Leonardo's stylistic innovations are even  more apparent in The Last Supper, in which  Leonardo da Vinci represented a traditional theme in an  entirely new way. Instead of showing the 12  apostles as individual figures, Leonardo da  Vinci grouped them in dynamic compositional  units of three, framing the figure of  Christ, who is isolated in the center of the  picture. Seated before a pale distant  landscape seen through a rectangular opening  in the wall, Christwho is about to announce  that one of those present will betray  himrepresents a calm nucleus while the  others respond with animated gestures. In  the monumentality of the scene and the  weightiness of the figures, Leonardo  reintroduced a style pioneered more than a  generation earlier by Masaccio, the father  of Florentine painting.    The Mona Lisa, Leonardo's most famous work,  is as well known for its mastery of  technical innovations as for the  mysteriousness of its legendary smiling  subject. This work is a consummate example  of two techniquessfumato and chiaroscuroof  which Leonardo was one of the first great  masters. Sfumato is characterized by subtle,  almost infinitesimal transitions between  color areas, creating a delicately  atmospheric haze or smoky effect; it is  especially evident in the delicate gauzy  robes worn by the sitter and in her  enigmatic smile. Chiaroscuro is the  technique of modeling and defining forms  through contrasts of light and shadow; the  sensitive hands of the sitter are portrayed  with a luminous modulation of light and  shade, while color contrast is used only  sparingly.          Leonardo da Vinci was among the first to  introduce atmospheric perspective into his  landscape backgrounds, an especially notable  characteristic of his paintings. The chief  masters of the High Renaissance in Florence,  including Raphael, Andrea del Sarto, and Fra  Bartolommeo, all learned from Leonardo;  Leonardo da Vinci completely transformed the  school of Milan; and at Parma, the artistic  development of Correggio was given direction  by Leonardo's work.            Leonardo da Vinci's many extant drawings,  which reveal his brilliant draftsmanship and  his mastery of the anatomy of humans,  animals, and plant life, may be found in the  principal European collections. The largest  group is at Windsor Castle in England.  Probably his most famous drawing is the  magnificent self-portrait in old age  (1510?-1513?, Biblioteca Reale, Turin,  Italy). - biografia de leonardo da Vinci oil painting, da Vinci paintings Italy - Bio oil painting Italy - art of  oil painting by daVinci oil painting supplier of he oil paintings, Italy oil painting da Vinci The Last Supper.     Because none of Leonardo's sculptural  projects was brought to completion, his  approach to three-dimensional art can only  be judged from his drawings. The same  strictures apply to his architecture: None  of his building projects was actually  carried out as he devised them. In his  architectural drawings, however, Leonardo da  Vinci demonstrates mastery in the use of  massive forms, a clarity of expression, and  especially a deep understanding of ancient  Roman sources.                                                            As a scientist Leonardo towered above all  his contemporaries. His scientific theories,  like his artistic innovations, were based on  careful observation and precise  documentation. Leonardo da Vinci understood, better than  anyone of his century or the next, the  importance of precise scientific  observation. Unfortunately, just as Leonardo da Vinci frequently failed to bring to conclusion  artistic projects, he never completed his  planned treatises on a variety of scientific  subjects. His theories are contained in  numerous notebooks, most of which were  written in mirror script. Because they were  not easily decipherable, Leonardo's findings  were not disseminated in his own lifetime;  had they been published, they would have  revolutionized the science of the 16th  century.                                                                            Leonardo  actually anticipated many discoveries of  modern times. In anatomy he studied the  circulation of the blood and the action of  the eye. Leonardo da Vinci made discoveries  in meteorology and geology, learned the  effect of the moon on the tides,  foreshadowed modern conceptions of continent  formation, and surmised the nature of fossil  shells. Leonardo da Vinci was among the originators of the  science of hydraulics and probably devised  the hydrometer; his scheme for the  canalization of rivers still has practical  value. Leonardo da Vinci invented a large number of  ingenious machines, many potentially useful,  among them an underwater diving suit. His  flying devices, although not practicable,  embodied sound principles of aerodynamics.                                                                          The titles of oil  painting old master Leonardo da Vinci   Toperfect supply oil painting masterpiece reproductions of the old master as below,  you are welcome to send us your own picture to copy.

Below we show our Fresco  reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci Last Supper - For sale          Among religious subjects, The Last Supper has been a favorite inspiration for many works of art, and numerous are the great masters who addressed this theme in some of their best known masterpieces. As far back as in the times of the early Christians, there were pictorial representations of the meal that could be found in the catacombs of Rome. These representations gave an idea of the atmosphere that existed in an ancient dining hall. A later representation is to be found in a bas-relief in the church at Monza in Italy that dates from the sixth century. There is also a pictorial representation in a Syrian codex in the Laurentian Library at Florence, as well as a mosaic representation of The Last Supper in the church of S. Apollinare Nuovo at Ravenna, Italy. Among the masters of the modern school of German artists, The Last Supper of Gebhardt is regarded as a masterpiece.    Below : A detail of the Last Supper From Leonardo Da Vinci In Milan - Not for sale ( I hope ...)        Of course, by far the most famous Last Supper interpretation belongs to Leonardo da Vinci. Other outstanding masterpieces were executed by Tintoretto, Veronese and Ghirlandaio. However, Da Vinci's Last Supper has become one of the most widely appreciated masterpieces in the world. It began to acquire its unique reputation immediately after it was finished in 1498, and its prestige has continued to grow. Despite the many changes that have taken place over the centuries in tastes, artistic styles, as well as the physical deterioration of the painting itself, the painting's status as an extraordinary creation has never been questioned nor doubted.    The outstanding features of the Last Supper reflect not only the highly artistic merits of the painting, but also Leonardo's expressive mastery. Leonardo's Last Supper is an ideal pictorial representation of the most important event in the Christian doctrine of salvation - the institution of the Eucharist. His representation of this part of the Christian doctrine has achieved unanimous acceptance and authority. There are countless copies and reproductions of the Last Supper in homes, places of worship, and museums throughout the world. However, when thoughts turn to the Last Supper, it seems that only Leonardo's representation comes to mind.    The Last Supper has also been subject to much attention due to the number of restorations it has had to face since its completion in the fifteenth century. The most recent restoration lasted twenty years and has been the subject of much controversy. One of the most frequent pungent criticisms leveled at this influential painting is that it has been ""repainted"" rather than ""restored"". However, clearly restoration has continued to be an ongoing necessity for this masterpiece due to the unprecedented manner in which Leonardo painted it (details of the technique below). Although restoration may have altered Leonardo's painting to a degree, it has prolonged the life of this painting to allow the viewing by future generations.

His renown primarily rests upon his brilliant achievements as a painter, the  Mona Lisa  and the  Last Supper , being two of the most famous artworks ever created, but also upon his diverse skills as a scientist and inventor. He became so highly valued during his lifetime that the King of France bore him home like a  trophy of war , supported him in his old age and, according to legend, cradled his head as he died.   Leonardo's portrait was used, within his own lifetime, as the iconic image of  Plato  in  Raphael 's  School of Athens . His biography was written in superlative terms by  Vasari . He has been repeatedly acclaimed the greatest genius to have lived. His painting of the  Mona Lisa  has been the most imitated artwork of all time and his drawing of the  Vitruvian Man  iconically represents the fusion of Art and Science.   Leonardo's biography has appeared in many forms, both scholarly and fictionalised. Every known aspect of his life has been scrutinised and analysed. His paintings, drawings and notebooks have been studied, reproduced and analysed for five centuries. The interest in and appreciation of the character of Leonardo and his talents has never waned.   Leonardo has appeared in many  fictional  works, such as  novels ,  television shows  and  movies , the first such fiction dating from the 16th century. Various characters have been named after him.

It has been suggested that it is Leonardo's portrait of his father or grandfather. On the other hand, an explanation that has been put forward to explain the apparent advanced age of the individual is that Leonardo deliberately drew himself as older than he really was, in order that  Raphael  might use it as the basis for his depiction of Leonardo as Plato in the  School of Athens .   The drawing has been the basis for other representations of Leonardo.           Mnageot 's  The Death of Leonardo da Vinci         [ edit ]   Death of Leonardo   The story of Leonardo dying in the arms of the French king  Francis I , although apochryphal [ 1 ] , appealed to French history painters of the 18th and 19th centuries.     [ edit ]   Mnageot's version   Mnageot  painted  The Death of Leonardo da Vinci in the arms of Francis I  in  1781 , setting it in a background of classical statuary. This included a portrayal of the  Borghese Gladiator  (Mnageot probably having seen it at the  Villa Borghese  during his stay at the  French Academy in Rome  from 1769 to 1774), although this was an anachronism since Leonardo died in  1519 , about ninety years before the statue was discovered.           The Death of Leonardo  by Ingres, 1818.         [ edit ]   Ingres' version   In 1818 the French painter  Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres  depicted the scene of Leonardo's death which is shown taking place in the home ""Clos Luce"" provided for him at Blois by King  Francis I . The King is shown supporting Leonardo's head as he dies, as described by  Vasari , watched by the  Dauphin  who is comforted by a cardinal. A distraught young man may represent Leonardo's pupil Melzi.   The treatment of this subject by Ingres is indicative of Leonardo's iconic status and also specifically that he was of particular significance to the school of French Classicism. A number of his paintings had passed into the Royal collection and certain elements of them were much imitated. Leonado's manner of soft shading known as ""sfumato"" was particularly adapted by Ingres,  Jacques Louis David  and their followers. An influential painting was  Leda and the swan , now regarded as by a pupil of Leonardo but then generally accepted as the master's work.

Theodore Mathieson 's short story  Leonardo Da Vinci: Detective  portrays him using his genius to solve a murder during his time in France.   The novel  Pasquale's Angel  by  Paul J. McAuley , set in an  alternate universe  Florence, portrays Leonardo as ""the Great Engineer"", creating a premature  industrial revolution  (see  clockpunk ).

Donatella was the daughter of an Italian magician. No connection between Leonardo and Donatella has been stated since.   In Robert Heinlen's The Door Into Summer, Dr. Twitchell recounts a tale of a student whom he displaced in time by 500 years. While there was no way of knowing whether the student went to the past or the future, Dr. Twitchell hints that he believes it was the past due to the student's name -- Leonard Vincent.       [ edit ]   The Da Vinci Code   This work of fiction has been the centre of controversy over the accuracy of its depictions of Christianity and of Leonardo.   A bestselling 2003 novel by  Dan Brown , adapted and released as a major  motion picture  in 2006,  The Da Vinci Code  revolves around a conspiracy based on elements of Leonardo's  Last Supper  and other works. A preface to the novel claims that depictions of artworks, secret societies and rites described within the novel are factual. For this reason much of the content of the novel has been widely accepted by readers as authoritative. Because the theme involves a conspiracy within the  Church  over the life of  Jesus  and the suggestion that the Church has hidden the facts of his marriage, there has been a strong reaction against the novel and much material published examining and refuting its claims.   Within the novel it is claimed that from 1510-1519, Leonardo was the Grand Master of a secret society, the  Priory of Sion . In reality this society existed only as a 20th century hoax, but author Dan Brown used as a source the 1982  pseudohistory  book  The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail . The writers of this book had based their research on forged medieval documents that had been created as part of the Priory of Sion fraud. The mix of fact and fiction in the documents made it difficult to discount immediately as a forgery. For example, it was claimed that the Grand Master prior to Leonardo was  Botticelli , who had indeed had an association with Leonardo, as they were both students at the Florence workshop of  Andrea del Verrocchio .   The Priory of Sion story and the veracity of  The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail  was eventually debunked, and many of those involved publicly recanted, although Dan Brown continued to assert that the facts as presented were true.   In portraying the Priory of Sion as ""fact""  The Da Vinci Code  expanded on the claims in  The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail :     That there were additional secrets hidden in Leonardo's paintings, such as an ""M"" letter in the painting of  The Last Supper , indicating the presence of  Mary Magdalene  and that the figure to the left of Jesus traditionally said to represent  John the Evangelist  actually represents  Mary Magdalene .   That Leonardo's painting  The Mona Lisa  was actually a self-portrait.   That among the differences in the two versions of the painting of the  Virgin of the Rocks  which hang in the  Louvre  and London's  National Gallery , is the fact that in the Louvre painting the baby to the left of the picture depicts  Jesus , and to the right  John the Baptist , rather than the accepted view, which is the other way round.   That Leonardo invented a  cryptex  for carrying secret messages.     The book also used a variation of Leonardo's backwards handwriting to hide a secret message on the American bookjacket.   Among the many criticisms of Brown's writing is that he uses the name da Vinci (meaning ""from Vinci"") in the manner that surnames are commonly used nowadays. Leonardo would never have been referred to simply as  da Vinci  in his lifetime. Such designations were appended to common baptismal names in order to identify individuals.

David Davalos's 2002 play  Daedalus  tells a fantasized story of Leonardo's time as a military engineer in the service of Cesare Borgia.       [ edit ]   Music     Author Charles Anthony Silvestri and composer  Eric Whitacre  collaborated to create an ""opera brve"" based on text from da Vinci's journals and original text by Silvestri. This piece,  Leonardo Dreams of His Flying Machine,  was modeled after da Vinci's conceptual flying machine. This piece was written on commission by the  American Choral Directors Association  as the second piece in Whitacre's series of ""Element Works,"" the first being  Cloudburst , written in 1992.       [ edit ]   Television fiction     In the anime OVA: 'Mask of Zeguy' Leonardo da Vinci was one of the antagonists who sought out the Crown of Shamus in order to prevent Himiko from using her powers to open the Gate of Winds, because his inventions (i.e. dangerous weapons) will become useless.   In  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!  live-action segment ""The Painting"", the Mario Bros. find a painting which happens to be Leonardo da Vinci's painting "" The Last Supper "". They call up Howard Stevens (played by the show's producer  Andy Heyward ), and he explains that it's the ""second Last Supper"" by Leonardo da Vinci ""Rooney"". However, upon further examination, they discover that the painting is actually worthless because it was painted by an impostor, Leonard da Vinci ""Mahoney"". Howard was able to identify it as Mahoney's painting because one of the people in the painting is Mahoney's uncle,  Roy Orbisoni Mahoney . The information dealing with da Vinci in this episode is incorrect.   In the  Star Trek: The Original Series  episode "" Requiem for Methuselah "", Leonardo da Vinci is revealed to be one of many aliases to ""Flint"", an immortal man born in the year 3834 BC. Leonardo's abilities and knowledge are thus attributed to centuries of scientific and artistic study. Leonardo appears again in the Star Trek universe, in the series  Star Trek: Voyager , where his workshop is created as a  holographic  simulation. Actor  James Daly  played Flint/Leonardo in  Star Trek: The Original Series , while  John Rhys-Davies  portrayed Leonardo in  Star Trek: Voyager . Also, in the S.C.E. ( Starfleet Corps of Engineers ) novellas, the main starship of the series is called the  U.S.S. da Vinci  (NCC-81623), a Sabre-class vessel, named for the artist.   The 1979  Doctor Who  story  City of Death  features a theft of the  Mona Lisa .  The Doctor  goes back in time to visit Leonardo's workshop and claims to be an old acquaintance of the artist. Leonardo also appears as a character in several  Doctor Who  novels.   The cartoon  The Tick  features Leonardo in ""Leonardo DaVinci and his Fightin' Genius Time Commandos!"" (Season 2, Episode 17, 1995) in which a number of famous inventors are brought to the present by an inventor seeking to take credit for their work. (Other inventors include Ben Franklin, George Washington Carver, and the neolithic inventor of the wheel, named Wheel.) Leonardo is portrayed as being able to create fantastic flying devices about of rudimentary objects.   The television show  Alias  features a character  Milo Giacomo Rambaldi , a fictional character clearly based on Leonardo.

Birth name   Lionardo di Ser Piero da Vinci       Born   April 15 ,  1452   Anchiano ,  Province of Florence , in modern-day  Italy       Died   May 2 ,  1519   Amboise ,  Indre-et-Loire , in modern-day  France       Nationality   Italian       Field   Many and diverse fields of  arts  and  sciences       Movement   High Renaissance       Works   Mona Lisa ,  The Last Supper ,  The Vitruvian Man       Leonardo da Vinci  ( 15 April   1452    2 May   1519 ) was an  Italian Renaissance   painter  and  polymath  who achieved legendary fame and iconic status within his own lifetime. His renown primarily rests upon his brilliant achievements as a painter, the  Mona Lisa  and the  Last Supper , being two of the most famous artworks ever created, but also upon his diverse skills as a scientist and inventor. He became so highly valued during his lifetime that the King of France bore him home like a  trophy of war , supported him in his old age and, according to legend, cradled his head as he died.   Leonardo's portrait was used, within his own lifetime, as the iconic image of  Plato  in  Raphael 's  School of Athens . His biography was written in superlative terms by  Vasari . He has been repeatedly acclaimed the greatest genius to have lived. His painting of the  Mona Lisa  has been the most imitated artwork of all time and his drawing of the  Vitruvian Man  iconically represents the fusion of Art and Science.   Leonardo's biography has appeared in many forms, both scholarly and fictionalised. Every known aspect of his life has been scrutinised and analysed. His paintings, drawings and notebooks have been studied, reproduced and analysed for five centuries. The interest in and appreciation of the character of Leonardo and his talents has never waned.   Leonardo has appeared in many  fictional  works, such as  novels ,  television shows  and  movies , the first such fiction dating from the 16th century. Various characters have been named after him.

It has been suggested that it is Leonardo's portrait of his father or grandfather. On the other hand, an explanation that has been put forward to explain the apparent advanced age of the individual is that Leonardo deliberately drew himself as older than he really was, in order that  Raphael  might use it as the basis for his depiction of Leonardo as Plato in the  School of Athens .   The drawing has been the basis for other representations of Leonardo.           Mnageot 's  The Death of Leonardo da Vinci         [ edit ]   Death of Leonardo   The story of Leonardo dying in the arms of the French king  Francis I , although apochryphal [ 1 ] , appealed to French history painters of the 18th and 19th centuries.     [ edit ]   Mnageot's version   Mnageot  painted  The Death of Leonardo da Vinci in the arms of Francis I  in  1781 , setting it in a background of classical statuary. This included a portrayal of the  Borghese Gladiator  (Mnageot probably having seen it at the  Villa Borghese  during his stay at the  French Academy in Rome  from 1769 to 1774), although this was an anachronism since Leonardo died in  1519 , about ninety years before the statue was discovered.           The Death of Leonardo  by Ingres, 1818.         [ edit ]   Ingres' version   In 1818 the French painter  Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres  depicted the scene of Leonardo's death which is shown taking place in the home ""Clos Luce"" provided for him at Blois by King  Francis I . The King is shown supporting Leonardo's head as he dies, as described by  Vasari , watched by the  Dauphin  who is comforted by a cardinal. A distraught young man may represent Leonardo's pupil Melzi.   The treatment of this subject by Ingres is indicative of Leonardo's iconic status and also specifically that he was of particular significance to the school of French Classicism. A number of his paintings had passed into the Royal collection and certain elements of them were much imitated. Leonado's manner of soft shading known as ""sfumato"" was particularly adapted by Ingres,  Jacques Louis David  and their followers. An influential painting was  Leda and the swan , now regarded as by a pupil of Leonardo but then generally accepted as the master's work.

Theodore Mathieson 's short story  Leonardo Da Vinci: Detective  portrays him using his genius to solve a murder during his time in France.   The novel  Pasquale's Angel  by  Paul J. McAuley , set in an  alternate universe  Florence, portrays Leonardo as ""the Great Engineer"", creating a premature  industrial revolution  (see  clockpunk ).   The novel  The Memory Cathedral  by  Jack Dann  is a fictional account of a ""lost year"" in the life of Leonardo. Dann has his genius protagonist actually create his flying machine.   The novel  Pilgrim  by  Timothy Findley  describes the encounters of an immortal named Pilgrim with Leonardo da Vinci among others, as told to  Carl Jung .   Terry Pratchett 's character  Leonard of Quirm  is a  pastiche  of Leonardo.

The Secret Supper  (2006) by Javier Sierra explores the symbology of Leonardo's  Last Supper , and its threat to the Catholic Church, as he is painting the fresco in 15th century Milan.   Black Madonna  (1996) by  Carl Sargent  and  Marc Gascoigne , is set in the  Shadowrun  game universe and portrays Leonardo as still living in the 21st century, blackmailing corporations to finance his inventions.   The Medici Seal , a children's novel by  Theresa Breslin  (2006).   In the  Children of the Red King  series, a Donatella Di Vinci married a Bertram Babbington-Bloor. Donatella was the daughter of an Italian magician. No connection between Leonardo and Donatella has been stated since.   In Robert Heinlen's The Door Into Summer, Dr. Twitchell recounts a tale of a student whom he displaced in time by 500 years. While there was no way of knowing whether the student went to the past or the future, Dr. Twitchell hints that he believes it was the past due to the student's name -- Leonard Vincent.       [ edit ]   The Da Vinci Code   This work of fiction has been the centre of controversy over the accuracy of its depictions of Christianity and of Leonardo.   A bestselling 2003 novel by  Dan Brown , adapted and released as a major  motion picture  in 2006,  The Da Vinci Code  revolves around a conspiracy based on elements of Leonardo's  Last Supper  and other works. A preface to the novel claims that depictions of artworks, secret societies and rites described within the novel are factual. For this reason much of the content of the novel has been widely accepted by readers as authoritative. Because the theme involves a conspiracy within the  Church  over the life of  Jesus  and the suggestion that the Church has hidden the facts of his marriage, there has been a strong reaction against the novel and much material published examining and refuting its claims.   Within the novel it is claimed that from 1510-1519, Leonardo was the Grand Master of a secret society, the  Priory of Sion . In reality this society existed only as a 20th century hoax, but author Dan Brown used as a source the 1982  pseudohistory  book  The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail . The writers of this book had based their research on forged medieval documents that had been created as part of the Priory of Sion fraud. The mix of fact and fiction in the documents made it difficult to discount immediately as a forgery. For example, it was claimed that the Grand Master prior to Leonardo was  Botticelli , who had indeed had an association with Leonardo, as they were both students at the Florence workshop of  Andrea del Verrocchio .   The Priory of Sion story and the veracity of  The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail  was eventually debunked, and many of those involved publicly recanted, although Dan Brown continued to assert that the facts as presented were true.   In portraying the Priory of Sion as ""fact""  The Da Vinci Code  expanded on the claims in  The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail :     That there were additional secrets hidden in Leonardo's paintings, such as an ""M"" letter in the painting of  The Last Supper , indicating the presence of  Mary Magdalene  and that the figure to the left of Jesus traditionally said to represent  John the Evangelist  actually represents  Mary Magdalene .   That Leonardo's painting  The Mona Lisa  was actually a self-portrait.   That among the differences in the two versions of the painting of the  Virgin of the Rocks  which hang in the  Louvre  and London's  National Gallery , is the fact that in the Louvre painting the baby to the left of the picture depicts  Jesus , and to the right  John the Baptist , rather than the accepted view, which is the other way round.   That Leonardo invented a  cryptex  for carrying secret messages.     The book also used a variation of Leonardo's backwards handwriting to hide a secret message on the American bookjacket.   Among the many criticisms of Brown's writing is that he uses the name da Vinci (meaning ""from Vinci"") in the manner that surnames are commonly used nowadays. Leonardo would never have been referred to simply as  da Vinci  in his lifetime. Such designations were appended to common baptismal names in order to identify individuals.     [ edit ]   Movies     Ever After  from 1998 starring  Drew Barrymore  and  Patrick Godfrey  as Leonardo da Vinci.   Hudson Hawk  starring  Bruce Willis  and  Danny Aiello  revolves around Leonardo da Vinci's inventions.   The Da Vinci Code  starring  Tom Hanks   The Da Vinci Treasure  depicts Da Vinci's paintings as clues that lead to  Enlightenment   Quest of the Delta Knights  depicting a fictional version of the young Leonardo   Animated Hero Classics: Leonardo Da Vinci(1996)  at the  Internet Movie Database   Christie Malry's Own Double-Entry  at the  Internet Movie Database       [ edit ]   Theatre     Peter Barnes 's 1969 play  Leonardo's Last Supper  centres on Leonardo being ""resurrected"" in a filthy charnel house after being prematurely declared dead.   David Davalos's 2002 play  Daedalus  tells a fantasized story of Leonardo's time as a military engineer in the service of Cesare Borgia.       [ edit ]   Music     Author Charles Anthony Silvestri and composer  Eric Whitacre  collaborated to create an ""opera brve"" based on text from da Vinci's journals and original text by Silvestri. This piece,  Leonardo Dreams of His Flying Machine,  was modeled after da Vinci's conceptual flying machine. This piece was written on commission by the  American Choral Directors Association  as the second piece in Whitacre's series of ""Element Works,"" the first being  Cloudburst , written in 1992.       [ edit ]   Television fiction     In the anime OVA: 'Mask of Zeguy' Leonardo da Vinci was one of the antagonists who sought out the Crown of Shamus in order to prevent Himiko from using her powers to open the Gate of Winds, because his inventions (i.e. dangerous weapons) will become useless.   In  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!  live-action segment ""The Painting"", the Mario Bros. find a painting which happens to be Leonardo da Vinci's painting "" The Last Supper "". They call up Howard Stevens (played by the show's producer  Andy Heyward ), and he explains that it's the ""second Last Supper"" by Leonardo da Vinci ""Rooney"". However, upon further examination, they discover that the painting is actually worthless because it was painted by an impostor, Leonard da Vinci ""Mahoney"". Howard was able to identify it as Mahoney's painting because one of the people in the painting is Mahoney's uncle,  Roy Orbisoni Mahoney . The information dealing with da Vinci in this episode is incorrect.   In the  Star Trek: The Original Series  episode "" Requiem for Methuselah "", Leonardo da Vinci is revealed to be one of many aliases to ""Flint"", an immortal man born in the year 3834 BC. Leonardo's abilities and knowledge are thus attributed to centuries of scientific and artistic study. Leonardo appears again in the Star Trek universe, in the series  Star Trek: Voyager , where his workshop is created as a  holographic  simulation. Actor  James Daly  played Flint/Leonardo in  Star Trek: The Original Series , while  John Rhys-Davies  portrayed Leonardo in  Star Trek: Voyager . Also, in the S.C.E. ( Starfleet Corps of Engineers ) novellas, the main starship of the series is called the  U.S.S. da Vinci  (NCC-81623), a Sabre-class vessel, named for the artist.   The 1979  Doctor Who  story  City of Death  features a theft of the  Mona Lisa .  The Doctor  goes back in time to visit Leonardo's workshop and claims to be an old acquaintance of the artist. Leonardo also appears as a character in several  Doctor Who  novels.   The cartoon  The Tick  features Leonardo in ""Leonardo DaVinci and his Fightin' Genius Time Commandos!"" (Season 2, Episode 17, 1995) in which a number of famous inventors are brought to the present by an inventor seeking to take credit for their work. (Other inventors include Ben Franklin, George Washington Carver, and the neolithic inventor of the wheel, named Wheel.) Leonardo is portrayed as being able to create fantastic flying devices about of rudimentary objects.   The television show  Alias  features a character  Milo Giacomo Rambaldi , a fictional character clearly based on Leonardo. [ citation needed ]   In the animated television series  Dilbert  episode "" Art "" has Leonardo as the secret ruler of the art world. He reveals that he discovered immortality centuries ago through the invention of the  fountain of youth .   An episode of  Histeria!  focusing on  the Renaissance  featured a cartoon caricature of Leonardo as a host. Over the course of the episode, he is criticized by  World's Oldest Woman  for  wearing a dress , and also parodies  the 1960s  Batman  series  as Renaissance Man, with  Loud Kiddington  as his sidekick.

This monumental bronze horse, 7 metres (24 feet) high, is a conjectural re-creation of a clay horse that was created in Milan by Leonardo da Vinci for the Duke Ludovico il Moro and was intended to be cast in bronze. Leonardo never finished the project because of war with France, and the clay horse was ruined. This representation was based on a number of Leonardo's preparatory drawings. It was created in 1999 in New York and given to the city of Milan.

Throughout his years he went through moments of despair, but he also found          glory when he was welcomed in Florence as a great painter of the day.          While only a few of Leonardo's works remain intact for us to see, and          while his life was long lived and sometimes filled with sadness, we are          blessed with the gift of the beautiful pieces that Da Vinci left behind.          The few paintings of Da Vinci's as well as the many notebooks are scattered          in different places throughout the world, one of his notebooks is even          owned by software tycoon,  Bill Gates . While we can't all buy the          actual pieces, we can still all take in a little bit of Da Vinci through          art prints of his works. Many Da Vinci art prints and posters exist, and          we can purchase the masterful  The Last Supper , or  The Mona Lisa           to bring a little bit of Da Vinci into our own homes.         While Da Vinci's paintings may express numerous thoughts, and may evoke          a multitude of feelings for the viewer, it becomes important to understand          what was going on in the painter's life when the work was made. Even a          Da Vinci poster alone may trigger a conversation about the painter, so          here are the facts you'll want to know:                                                                                                 1452               Leonardo is born on April 15 in the village of Anchiano,                near the town of Vinci.                                    1467               At 15 Leonardo is sent to Florence to work as apprentice                to Andrea De Verrocchio.                                     1472               20 year-old Leonardo is accepted into the painters'                guild of Florence.                                    1476               Leonardo is accused of sodomy; he is publicly humiliated                although the charges are later dropped.                                    1478               The Annunciation is painted. The work, initially                credited to Da Vinci, is now believed to have been painted by Lorenzo                di Credi.                                    1481               Leonardo begins work on The Adoration of the Magi,                an altarpiece for the Monastery of San Donato at Scopeto.

The Italian word  “ Cenacolo” comes from the Latin  “Caena” which means dinner, supper. In English “last supper” means the last  meal of Jesus Christ with his Apostles, but id does not give the idea of its  location. On the contrary with the word “cenacolo” we mean the picture of a  Last Supper and the place where it is located. This place is the dining hall of  a monastery.      The first extra expenses of a religious community  after the built of a monastery were for the decoration of the church, the next  for the decoration of the chapterhouse and the main dining hall (also named  cenacolo) which were the official representative halls of the monastery. These  decoration were always in fresco. In the centuries many of them were torn off  and placed into museums. But while for many pictures and altar pieces this  behaviour was common and often useful, the last suppers need their own location  to be understood and valued. The frescoes of this part are all in their  original location.       San  Marco Last Supper  (Piazza San Marco,  1)      In 1482 Domenico Ghirlandaio painted this Last Supper  to decorate the small refectory of the Dominican Convent       Santa  Apollonia Last Supper  (Via XXVII  Aprile, 1)      Andrea Del Castagno painted this masterpiece under a  Crucifixion a Deposition and a Resurrection before 1450       Affresco  del Perugino = Fresco by Perugino       This is not a last supper but a crucifixion; as it is  located in a dining hall of the ancient monastery, and as it is a remarkable  painting, I like to include it in the tour. You find it in Borgo Pinti (near  Via della Colonna, at your left going to the centre of the own. First you find  a cloister, a peaceful and nice cloister, then the hall with the painting.  Sometime you can also meet an old friar who knows many things about the  painting and the place and who’ll be happy to talk with you.       Fuligno  Last Supper  (Via Faenza 42)      Il Perugino painted this Last Supper in 1495 with a  bright background which recall Umbria’s landscape.       S. Croce Last Supper       In the large dining hall, in 1340 Taddeo Gaddi  painted this Lst Supper, over it the Tree of the Cross. This fresco was  originally ascribed to Giotto and is the first big “Supper” in Florence.       Andrea  del Sarto Last Supper in San Salvi  (Via  San Salvi, 16)      In the old refectory of the Vallombrosan Abbey on the  outskirts of Florence, Andrea del Sarto painted the life-like Last Supper , his  most spectacular masterpiece and ""one of the most beautiful paintings in  the world"". The Last Supper was begun in 1519 and was finished between  1526 and 1527       Santo Spirito Last Supper       Under the Crucifixion there is a part of the Last  Supper painted by Andrea Orcagna about 1370       Ognissanti Last Supper  (Borgognissanti,42)      In 1480 Domenico Ghirlandaio paited this famous Last  Supper in the big convent of this precious church.       Last Supper in Badia di Passignano       Do you remember Domenico Ghirlandaio, the one who  painted Holy Mary and St John histories behind the main altar of Santa Maria  Novella? Here, in this village near Tavarnelle Val di Pesa, he painted this  fresco inside the dining hall of the convent.

He was one of the greatest minds of the Italian Renaissance, and his influence on the painting of the following generations was enormous. Leonardo da Vinci was born on April 15, 1452, near the village of Vinci about 25 miles west of Florence. He was the illegitimate son of Ser Piero da Vinci, a prominent notary of Florence, who had no other children until much later. Ser Piero raised his son himself, a common practice at the time, arranging for Leonardo's mother to marry a villager. When Leonardo was 15, his father apprenticed him to Andrea del Verrocchio, the leading artist of Florence and a characteristic talent of the early Renaissance. Verrocchio, a sculptor, painter, and goldsmith, was a remarkable craftsman, and his great skill and passionate concern for                  quality of execution, as well as his interest in expressing the vital mobility of the human figure, were important element. Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian Renaissance architect, musician, anatomist, inventor, engineer, sculptor, geometer, and painter. He has been described as the archetype of the ""Renaissance man"" and as a universal genius. Leonardo is famous for his masterly paintings, such as The Last Supper and Mona Lisa. He is also known for designing many inventions that anticipated modern technology but were rarely constructed in his lifetime. In addition, he helped advance the study of anatomy, astronomy, and civil engineering.                  Leonardo da Vinci was born on April 15, 1452, in Anchiano, near Vinci, Italy. He was an illegitimate child. His father, Ser Piero da Vinci was a young lawyer and his mother,Caterina, was probably a peasant girl. It has also been suggested, albeit on scanty evidence, that she was a Middle Eastern slave owned by Piero. However, the lattertheory is unlikely to be true. As he was born before modern naming conventions developed in Europe, his full name was ""Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci"", which means""Leonardo, son of Mister Piero, from Vinci"". Leonardo himself simply signed his works ""Leonardo"" or ""Io, Leonardo"" (""I, Leonardo""). Most authorities therefore refer to hisworks as ""Leonardos"", not ""da Vincis"". Presumably he did not use his father's name because of his illegitimate status.                   Leonardo grew up with his father in Florence. Here, he started drawing and painting. His early sketches were of such quality that his father soon showed them to the painterAndrea del Verrocchio who subsequently took the fourteen-year old Leonardo on as an apprentice. Later, he became an independent painter in Florence. Modern criticscontend that Leonardo's love of boys was well-known even in the sixteenth century. Rocke reports that in a fictional dialogue on l'amore masculino (male love) written by the contemporary art critic and theorist Gian Paolo Lomazzo, Leonardo appears as one of the protagonists and declares, ""Know that male love is exclusively the product ofvirtue which, joining men together with the diverse affections of friendship, makes it so that from a tender age they would enter into the manly one as more stalwart friends."" In the dialogue, the interlocutor inquires of Leonardo about his relations with his assistant, Salai, ""Did you play the game from behind which the Florentines love so much?""                   From around 1482 to 1499 Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan employed Leonardo and permitted him to operate his own workshop complete with apprentices. It was here thatseventy tons of bronze that had been set aside for Leonardo's ""Gran Cavallo"" horse statue (see below) were cast into weapons for the Duke in an attempt to save Milan fromthe French under Charles VIII in 1495. When the French returned under Louis XII in 1498, Milan fell without a fight, overthrowing Sforza. Leonardo stayed in Milan for a time,until one morning when he found French archers using his life-size clay model of the ""Gran Cavallo"" for target practice. He left with Salai and his friend (and the first man todescribe double-entry bookkeeping) Luca Pacioli for Mantua, moving on after 2 months to Venice (where he was hired as a military engineer), then briefly returning toFlorence at the end of April 1500.                   In Florence he entered the services of Cesare Borgia (also called ""Duca Valentino"", the son of Pope Alexander VI) as a military architect and engineer with whom he travelled throughout Italy. In 1506 he returned to Milan, now in the hands of Maximilian Sforza after Swiss mercenaries had driven out the French.                 From 1513 to 1516 he lived in Rome, where painters like Raphael and Michelangelo were active at the time, though he did not have much contact with these artists. However, he was probably of pivotal importance in relocation of 'David', one of Michelangelo's masterpieces, against the artist's will. In 1515 Francis I of France retook Milan, and Leonardo was commissioned to make a centrepiece (a mechanical lion) for the peace talks between the French King and Pope Leo X in Bologna, where he must have first met the King. In 1516, he entered Francis' service, being given the use of the manor house Clos Lucé next to the king's residence at the Royal Chateau at Amboise The King granted Leonardo and his entourage generous pensions: the surviving document lists 1000 ecus for the artist, 400 for Melzi (named ""apprentice"") and 100 for Salai                  (named ""servant""). In 1518 Salai left Leonardo and returned to Milan, where he eventually perished in a duel. Francis became a close friend.                 Leonardo da Vinci died in Cloux, France on 2nd May, 1519, in the arms of King Francis. According to his wish, 60 beggars followed his casket. He was buried in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert in the castle of Amboise. Melzi was his principal heir and executor, but Salai was not forgotten: he received half of Leonardo's vineyard. Leonardo is well known for his artistry and paintings, such as Last Supper (Ultima Cena or Cenacolo, in Milan) 1498, and the Mona Lisa (also known as La Gioconda, now at the Louvre in Paris), 1503-1506. Though there is significant debate whether Leonardo himself painted the Mona Lisa, or whether it was the work of his students, it is known that it was probably his favorite piece. He most likely kept it with him at all times, and not travelling without it. Thousands of people see it each year in the Louvre, perhaps drawing their own interpretation on what is known as the Mona Lisa's most infamous and enigmatic feature - her smile. Leonardo often planned grandiose paintings with many drawings and sketches, only to leave the projects unfinished. For example, in 1481 he was commissioned to paint the altarpiece ""The Adoration of the Magi"". After extensive, bitious plans and many drawings, the painting was left unfinished and Leonardo left for Milan. Only seventeen of his paintings and none of his statues survived.                 In Milan he spent 17 years making plans and models for a monumental seven-metre (24-foot) high horse statue in bronze (""Gran Cavallo"". Because of war with France, the project was never finished. Based on private initiative, a similar statue was completed according to some of his plans in 1999 in New York, given to Milan and erected there. The Hunt Museum in Limerick, Ireland has a small bronze horse, thought to be the work of an apprentice from Leonardo's original design. After returning to Florence, he was commissioned for a large public mural, the ""Battle of Anghiari""; his rival Michelangelo was to paint the opposite wall. After producing a fantastic variety of studies in preparation for the work, he left the city, with the mural unfinished due to technical difficulties.                 Leonardo pioneered new painting techniques in many of his pieces. One of them, a colour shading technique called ""Sfumato"", used a series of custom-made glazes by Leonardo. It is characterized by subtle, almost infinitesimal, transitions between color areas, creating a atmospheric haze or smoky effect.

Transverse view along a narrow terrace, Villa Carlotta, Tremezzo,  Lake Como : stairs from an upper level are inset in the  retaining wall .       In  gardening , a  terrace  is an element where a raised flat paved or gravelled section overlooks a  prospect . A raised terrace keeps a house dry and provides a transition between the hard materials of the  architecture  and softer ones of the garden.           Contents       1   History   2   References     2.1   Notes   2.2   Bibliography   2.3   External links                   [ edit ]   History   Since a level site is generally regarded as a requisite for comfort and repose, the terrace as a raised viewing platform made an early appearance in the  Persian  gardening tradition, where the enclosed orchard, or  paradise , was to be viewed from a ceremonial tent. Such a terrace had its origins in the far older agricultural practice of terracing a sloping site: see  Terrace (agriculture) . The  Hanging Gardens of Babylon  must have been built on an artificial mountain with stepped terraces, like those on a  ziggurat .  Lucullus  brought back to Rome first-hand experience of Persian gardening in the hilly sites of Asia Minor; the villa  gardens of Maecenas , which included libraries open to scholars, incurred the disdain of  Seneca . At  Praeneste  during the early Imperial period, the sanctuary of  Fortuna  was enlarged and elaborated, the natural slope being shaped into a series of terraces linked by stairs.          Steep ground at  Powys Castle , North Wales, falls away in a series of terraces, some supported on  vaulted  undercrofts.       The imperial villas at  Capri  were built to take advantage of varied terraces. At the seaside  Villa of the Papyri  in Herculaneum, the villa gardens of  Julius Caesar 's father-in-law fell away in a series of terraces, giving pleasant and varied views of the Bay of Naples. Only some of them have been excavated.   During the  Italian Renaissance , the formalized, civilizing imprint of human control over wild nature expressed in terracing that was combined with stairs and water features, drew villa patrons and garden designers to escarpments that surveyed a handsome prospect. At the influential  Cortile del Belvedere  at the  Vatican Palace , perfected under a series of popes from the earliest 16th century, the backdrop within the enclosed court was a raised terrace. The view in this case was from the  Stanze of Raphael  on an upper floor of the Palace.   Even in the most naturalistic  landscape gardens  of  Capability Brown , a raised gravelled or paved terrace along the garden front offered a dry walk in damp weather and a transition between the hard materials of the architecture and the rolling greensward beyond.   Modern terrace gardens often occur in urban areas and are structures that extend out from an apartment or residence at any floor level other than ground level. They are often discussed in conjunction with  roof gardens , although they are not true roof gardens because they are an extension of a building itself. These outdoor spaces can be turned into surprisingly lush gardens through the use of  container gardening , automated  drip irrigation  systems, and furnishings. Landscapers creating terraces today, such as New York City landscape designer  Amber Freda , often combine elements to create an effect not unlike that of an outdoor garden room.

Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (January 2008)       Sir  Robert Dudley 's  Dell'Arcano del Mare  is a 17th-century maritime encyclopedia, the sixth part of which comprises a maritime  atlas  of the entire  world  which is the first such in print, the first made by an Englishman, and the first to use the  Mercator projection . The work was first published in  Italian  at  Florence  in 1645 and 1646 in three  folio  volumes. Among other things, it is remarkable for its inclusion of a proposal for the construction of a  navy  in five rates which Dudley designed and described. It was reprinted in Florence in a two volume folio edition in 1661 without the charts of the first edition.   The six-part work covered  navigation ,  shipbuilding  and  astronomy , with 130  maps  in two volumes (nos. 2 and 6) . Unlike the vast majority of his contemporaries, Dudley's maps are all his own and were not copied from other mapmakers. They have an instantly recognizable style, closer to the pre-17th-century manuscript  portolan charts  than the richly decorated maps of  Mercator ,  Hondius  and  Blaeu .   The distinctive  Baroque  style of Dudley's charts is in part attributable to the elegant engraving of  Antonio Francesco Lucini .   Later map-makers chose not to copy Dudley's style and so it remains unique in the annals of cartography. The engraving by Antonio Francesco Lucini, who stated that he spent 12 years and used 5,000 pounds of copper to produce the plates, is of exceptional quality, as is the calligraphy.     [ edit ]   Individual maps   ""Carta Particolare Che Mosta Il Capo Buona Speranza"" is a very large sea chart of southwest  Africa  from  Cape Fria  to  Cape of Good Hope , including  Tristan da Cunha . Engraved by Antonio Lucini for Sir Robert Dudley's sea atlas  Dell' Arcano del Mare , ""the first English sea-atlas, the first sea-atlas of the whole World, and the first on Mercator's projection"". Decorated with ships and swash lettering. Florence 1646   ""Carta Quarta Generale di Europa"", 1646 is one of the larger scale, generalized (Carta Generale) maps and shows the West coast of  France , southward from  La Rochelle , and the Northern coast of  Spain . This is the least ornate of the styles adopted by Dudley with no adornment other than the cartouche and a compass rose and fairly plain  calligraphy .   Four additional maps represent the majority of the smaller scale, more specific ( Carta Particolare ) maps and include sailing ships, notes on prevailing  winds  and  currents  and more stylized calligraphy.   ""Carta Particolare della Costa Australe scoperta dalla Ollandesia"", 1646. According to Tooley, this map is the first separately printed map of  Australia  and is consequently of great value. It shows, in addition to the west side of the  Cape York  peninsula, much of the island of  New Guinea . By labeling the  Torres Strait  ""Golfo Incognito"" Dudley leaves open the question of whether New Guinea is connected to the Southern continent.   ""Carta Particolare della Rio d' Amazone con la costa sin al fiume Maranhan"" of 1646 shows the mouth of the  Amazon River .   ""Carta particolare che comincia con l' Isola di S. Tomaso o Tome....Clara e finisce con Il c. d' Aldeas"". This map of the shoreline of the African  Congo  includes an elegant cartouche, and islands off the coastline.   ""Carta particolare della Brasilia Australe che comincia dala Poro del Spirito Santo e finisce con il capo Bianco"" reveals a strip of the southern  Brazil  coastline and includes  So Paulo  and the area later to become  Rio de Janeiro . Noted for some of the most peculiar representations of mountains near the coastline found on any Dudley map.   French Guiana ,  Guyana  and a small portion of Brazil.   The seventh map is one of only two in the atlas which have no title but instead dedications to the  Grand Duke of Tuscany  and, in this case, the Grand Duchess, Dudley's patrons. This is another double page map and probably comes from the 1646 edition. These two maps are probably different because they are the only ones where Dudley was able to use his own observations as they cover the North East coast of  South America , the area he visited in 1594. This map shows the coasts of French Guiana, Guyana and a small portion of Brazil. Considerably more elaborate than the others, this map includes soundings and numerous illustrations, namely: two  ships , a  canoe , two magnificent  sea monsters , a (?)  cougar  and two natives. It also has a legend stating that Monoa - more often known as  El Dorado  is only 12 days journey up-river from the coast.

He was the son of a  lieutenant  of the  Italian Army , Carlo Alberto (1892   Rome , December 19, 1958), who had become famous for saving  Benito Mussolini 's life, and an elementary school teacher, married in 1921, Susanna Colussi ( Casarsa , 1891 ) [ citation needed ] , and was named after his paternal uncle. His grandfather was Argobasto dei Conti Pasolini Dall'Onda, born in  Ravenna  in 1870. His family moved to  Conegliano  in 1923 and, two years later, to  Belluno , where another son, Guidalberto, was born. In 1926, however, Pasolini's father was arrested for gambling debts, and his mother moved to her family's house in  Casarsa della Delizia , in the  Friuli  region.   Pasolini began writing poems at the age of seven, inspired by the natural beauty of Casarsa. One of his early influences was the work of  Arthur Rimbaud . In 1933 his father was transferred to  Cremona , and later to  Scandiano  and  Reggio Emilia . Pasolini found it difficult to adapt to all these moves, though in the meantime he enlarged his poetry and literature readings ( Dostoevsky ,  Tolstoy ,  Shakespeare ,  Coleridge ,  Novalis ) and left behind the religious fervor of his early years. In the Reggio Emilia high school he met his first true friend, Luciano Serra. The two met again in Bologna, where Pasolini spent seven years while completing the high school: here he cultivated new passions, including  football . With other friends, including Ermes Parini, Franco Farolfi, Elio Meli, he formed a group dedicated to literary discussions.   In 1939 he graduated and entered the Literature College of the  University of Bologna , discovering new themes like  philology  and  aesthetics  of  figurative arts . He also frequented the local cinema club. Pasolini always showed his friends a virile and strong exterior, totally hiding his interior travail. He took part in the  Fascist  government's culture and sports competitions. In 1941, together with  Francesco Leonetti ,  Roberto Roversi  and others, he attempted to publish a poetry magazine, but the attempt failed due to paper shortages. In his poems of this period, Pasolini started to include fragments in  Friulian , which he had learned from his mother.     [ edit ]   First poetical works   After the summer in Casarsa, in 1941 Pasolini published at his own expense a collection of poems in Friulian,  Versi a Casarsa . The work was noted and appreciated by intellectuals and critics like  Gianfranco Contini ,  Alfonso Gatto  and  Antonio Russi . His pictures had also been well received. Pasolini was chief editor of the  Il Setaccio  (""The Sieve"") magazine, but was fired after conflicts with the director, who was aligned with the Fascist regime. A trip to Germany helped him also to discover the ""provincial"" status of Italian culture in that era. These experiences led Pasolini to rethink his opinion about the cultural politics of Fascism, and to switch gradually to a  Communist  position.   In 1942, the family took shelter in Casarsa, considered a more tranquil place to wait for the conclusion of the  war , a decision common among Italian military families. Here, for the first time, Pasolini had to face the erotic disquiet he had suppressed during his adolescent years. He wrote: ""A continuous perturbation without images or words beats at my temples and obscures me"".   In the weeks before the 8 September  armistice , Pasolini was drafted in  World War II . He was captured and imprisoned by the  Germans . He managed to escape disguised as a peasant, and found his way to Casarsa. Here he joined a group of other young fans of the Friulian language who wanted to give Casarsa Friulian a status equal to that of  Udine , the official regional dialect. From May 1944 they issued a magazine entitled  Stroligt di c da l'aga . In the meantime, Casarsa suffered Allied bombardments and forced enrollments by the  Italian Social Republic , as well as  partisan  activity.   Pasolini tried to remain apart from these events. He and his mother taught students unable to reach the schools in  Pordenone  or  Udine . He experienced his first  homosexual  love for one of his students. At the same time, a  Slovenian  schoolgirl, Pina Kal, was falling in love with Pasolini. On February 12, 1945, his brother Guido was killed in an ambush. Six days later Pasolinia and others founded the Friulian Language Academy ( Academiuta di lenga furlana ). In the same year Pasolini joined the Association for the Autonomy of Friuli. He graduated after completing a final thesis about  Giovanni Pascoli 's works.   In 1946 Pasolini published a small poetry collection,  I Diarii  (""The Diaries""), with the Academiuta. In October he traveled to  Rome . The following May he began the so-called  Quaderni Rossi , handwritten in old school exercise-books with red covers. He completed a drama in Italian,  Il Cappellano . His poetry collection,  I Pianti  (""The cries""), was also published by the Academiuta.     [ edit ]   Adherence to the Italian Communist Party   On January 26, 1947, Pasolini wrote a controversial declaration for the front page of the newspaper  Libert : ""In our opinion, we think that currently only Communism is able to provide a new culture"". The controversy was partially due to the fact he was still not a member of the  Italian Communist Party  (PCI).   He was also planning to extend the work of the Academiuta to other  Romance language  literatures and knew the exiled  Catalan  poet,  Carles Card . After his adherence to the PCI, he took part in several demonstrations and, in May 1949, attended the Peace Congress in  Paris . Observing the struggles of workers and peasants, and watching the clashes of protesters with Italian police, he began to create his first novel.   However, in October of the same year, Pasolini was charged with the corruption of minors and obscene acts in public places. As a result, he was expelled by the Udine section of the Communist Party and lost the teaching job he had obtained the previous year in Valvasone. Living a difficult situation, in January 1950 Pasolini moved to Rome with his mother.   He later described this period of his life as a very difficult one. ""I came to Rome from the Friulian countryside. Unemployed for many years; ignored by everybody; riven by the fear to be not as life needed to be"". Instead of asking for help from other writers, Pasolini preferred to go his own way. He found a job as a worker in the  Cinecitt  studios, and sold his books in the 'bancarelle' (""sidewalk shops"") of Rome. Finally, through the help of the  Abruzzese -language poet  Vittorio Clemente , he found a job as a teacher in  Ciampino , a suburb of the capital.   In these years Pasolini transferred his Friulian countryside inspiration to Rome's suburbs, the infamous  borgate  where poor  proletarian  immigrants lived in often horrendous sanitary and social conditions.     [ edit ]   Success and charges   In 1954, Pasolini, who now worked for the literature section of the Italian state radio, left his teaching job and moved to the Monteverde quarter, publishing  La meglio giovent , his first important collection of dialect poems. His first novel,  Ragazzi di vita  (English:  Boys of Life ), was published in 1955. The work had great success, but was poorly received by the PCI establishment and, most importantly, by the Italian government, which even initiated a lawsuit against Pasolini and his editor, Garzanti.   Though totally exculpated of any charge, Pasolini became a favourite victim of insinuations, especially by the  tabloid press .   In 1957, together with  Sergio Citti , Pasolini collaborated on  Federico Fellini 's film  Le Notti di Cabiria , writing dialogue for the  Roman dialect  parts. In 1960, he made his debut as an actor in  Il gobbo , and co-wrote  Long Night in 1943 .   His first film as director and screenwriter is  Accattone  of 1961, again set in Rome's marginal quarters. The movie again aroused controversy and scandal. In 1963, the episode ""La ricotta"", included in the collective movie  RoGoPaG , was censored, and Pasolini was tried for offence to the Italian state.   During this period, Pasolini was frequently abroad: in 1961, with  Elsa Morante  and  Alberto Moravia  in  India  (where he went again seven years later); in 1962 in  Sudan  and  Kenya ; in 1963, in  Ghana ,  Nigeria ,  Guinea ,  Jordan , and  Palestine  (where he shot the documentary,  Sopralluoghi in Palestina ). In 1970, he traveled again to  Africa  to shoot the documentary,  Appunti per un'Orestiade africana .   The late 1960s and early 1970s were the era of the so-called ""student movement."" Pasolini, though acknowledging the ideological motivations of the students, thought them ""anthropologically middle-class"" and, therefore destined to fail in their attempts at revolutionary change. He went so far as to state, regarding the  Battle of Valle Giulia , which took place in Rome in March, 1968, that he sympathized with the police, as they were ""children of the poor"", while the young militants were exponents of what he called ""left-wing fascism."" His film of that year,  Teorema , was shown at the annual  Venice Film Festival  in a hot political climate, as Pasolini had proclaimed that the festival would be managed by the directors themselves (see also  Works section ).   In 1970, Pasolini bought an old castle near  Viterbo , several kilometers north of Rome, where he began to write his last novel,  Petrolio,  which was never finished. In 1972, he started to collaborate with the extreme-left association  Lotta Continua , producing a documentary,  12 dicembre  concerning the  Piazza Fontana bombing . The following year, he began a collaboration for Italy's most renowned newspaper,  Il Corriere della Sera .   At the beginning of 1975, Garzanti published a collection of critical essays,  Scritti corsari  (""Corsair Writings"").     [ edit ]   Death   Pasolini was brutally murdered by being run over several times with his own car, dying on November 2, 1975 on the beach at  Ostia , near  Rome . Pasolini was buried in Casarsa, in his beloved  Friuli . He was buried wearing the jersey of the Italian Showmen national team, a charity soccer team he founded. [ citation needed ]   Giuseppe Pelosi, a seventeen-year-old  hustler , was arrested and confessed to murdering Pasolini. Thirty years later on May 7, 2005, he retracted his confession, which he said was made under the threat of violence to his family. He claimed that three people ""with a southern accent"" had committed the murder, insulting Pasolini as a ""dirty communist"". [ 1 ]   Following Pelosi's retraction, the investigation into Pasolini's death was reopened. The murder is still not completely explained. Contradictions in Pelosi's statements, a strange intervention by Italian secret services during the investigations, and some lack of coherence in related documents during different parts of the judicial procedures brought some of Pasolini's friends to suspect that it had been a contract killing. [ citation needed ]  His friend  Oriana Fallaci  exposed inefficiency in the investigations, writing in  Europeo  magazine. Many clues suggest that it was unlikely that Pelosi killed Pasolini alone. [ citation needed ]   Other evidence uncovered in 2005 pointed to Pasolini having been murdered by an extortionist. Testimony by Pasolini's friend Sergio Citti indicated that some of the rolls of film from  Sal  had been stolen, and that Pasolini had been going to meet with the thieves after a visit to  Stockholm , November 2, 1975.   Others theorize that Pasolini may have wanted to be killed and staged his death. Proponents of this theory include Pasolini's lifelong friend painter and writer Giuseppe Zigaina. Zigaina claims that ""Pasolini himself was the 'organizer' of his own death, which, conceived as a form of expression, was intended to give meaning to his entire oeuvre."" [ 2 ]  Zigaina argued that Pasolini had been planning his death for many years and planted codes in his works that revealed when and how it would happen. Alberto Moravia also found striking similarities between Pasolini's death and his work. In 1977, Moravia wrote a book about the murder. He said he recognized the Ostia murder scene from Pasolini's descriptions of similar landscapes in his two novels  Ragazzi di vita (The Ragazzi)  and  Una vita violenta (A Violent Life) , and in an image from his first film  Accattone . Pasolini shot footage of the site a year earlier, for use in his film  Il fiore delle mille e una notte (A Thousand and One Nights) . Unlike Zigaina, however, Moravia considered those similarities as no more than poetic irony. [ 3 ]   Despite the Roman police's reopening of the murder case following Pelosi's statement of May 2005, the judges charged with investigating it determined the new elements insufficient for them to continue the inquiry.   On the 30th anniversary of his death in 2005,  Mario Verger  released an animated biographical cartoon, entitled  Pasolini requiem , with passages drawn from  Mamma Roma ,  Uccellacci e uccellini , and  La Terra vista dalla Luna . It ends with a description of the Ostia murder.     [ edit ]   Works   Pasolini's first novel  Ragazzi di vita  (1955) dealt with the Roman  lumpen proletariat . The resulting  obscenity  charges against him were the first of many instances where his  art  provoked legal problems.  Accattone  (1961), also about the  Roman  underworld, also provoked controversy with conservatives, who demanded stricter  censorship .   He then directed the black-and-white  The Gospel According To St. Matthew  (1964). This film is widely hailed as the best cinematic adaptation of the life of  Jesus  ( Enrique Irazoqui ). Whilst filming it, Pasolini vowed to direct it from the ""believer's point of view"", but later, upon viewing the completed work, saw he had instead expressed his own beliefs.   In his  1966  film,  Uccellacci e uccellini  (literally  Bad Birds and Little Birds  but translated in English as  The Hawks and the Sparrows ), a picaresque - and at the same time mystic - fable, he hired the great Italian  comedian   Tot  to work with one of his preferred ""naif"" actors,  Ninetto Davoli . It was a unique opportunity for Tot to demonstrate that he was a great dramatic actor as well.   In  Teorema  ( Theorem , 1968), starring  Terence Stamp  as a mysterious stranger, he depicted the sexual coming-apart of a  bourgeois  family (later repeated by  Franois Ozon  in  Sitcom ).   Later movies centered on sex-laden  folklore , such as  Boccaccio 's  Decameron  (1971) and  Chaucer 's  Canterbury Tales  (1972), and  Il fiore delle mille e una notte  (literally  The Flower of 1001 Nights , released in English as  Arabian Nights , 1974). These films are usually grouped as the  Trilogy of Life . His final work,  Sal  ( Sal, or the 120 Days of Sodom , 1975), exceeded what most viewers could then stomach in its explicit scenes of intensely sadistic violence. Based on the novel  120 Days of Sodom  by the  Marquis de Sade , it is considered his most controversial film. In May 2006,  Time Out ' s Film Guide named it the Most Controversial Film of all time.     [ edit ]   Significance   As a director, Pasolini created a  picaresque   neorealism , showing a sad reality. Many people did not want to see such portrayals in artistic work for public distribution.  Mamma Roma  (1962), featuring  Anna Magnani  and telling the story of a prostitute and her son, was an affront to the morality of those times. His works, with their unequaled poetry applied to cruel realities, showing that such realities are less distant from us than we imagine, made a major contribution to change in the Italian psyche. [ citation needed ]   The director also promoted in his works the concept of ""natural sacredness,"" the idea that the world is holy in and of itself. He suggested there was no need for spiritual essence or supernatural blessing to attain this state. Pasolini was an avowed  atheist .   General disapproval of Pasolini's work was perhaps caused primarily by his frequent focus on sexual mores, and the contrast between what he presented and publicly sanctioned behavior. While Pasolini's poetry often dealt with his same-sex love interests, this was not the only, or even main, theme. Much of the poetry was about his highly revered mother. As a sensitive and intelligent man, he depicted certain corners of the contemporary reality as few other poets could do. His poetry was not as well-known as his films outside Italy. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Legacy and honors   His films won awards at the  Berlin Film Festival ,  Cannes Film Festival ,  Venice Film Festival , Italian National Syndicate for Film Journalists,  Jussi Awards , Kinema Junpo Awards, International Catholic Film Office and  New York Film Critics Circle .     [ edit ]   Political views   Pasolini generated heated public discussion with controversial analyses of public affairs. For instance, during the disorders of 1969, when the  autonomist  university students were carrying on a guerrilla-like uprising against the police in the streets of Rome and all the leftist forces declared their complete support for the students, describing the disorders as a civil fight of proletariat against the System, Pasolini, alone among the communists, declared that he was with the police; or, more precisely, with the policemen. He considered them true proletariat, sent to fight for a poor salary and for reasons which they could not understand, against pampered boys of their same age, because they had not had the fortune of being able to study, referring to  poliziotti figli di proletari meridionali picchiati da figli di pap in vena di bravate  (lit.  policemen, sons of proletarian southerners, beaten up by arrogant daddy's boys  ). This ironic statement, however, did not stop him from contributing to the autonomist  Lotta continua  movement.   Pasolini was also an ardent critic of  consumismo , i.e.  consumerism , which he felt had rapidly destroyed Italian society in the late 1960s/early 1970s. He was particularly concerned about the class of the  subproletariat , which he portrayed in  Accattone , and to which he felt both sexually and artistically drawn. Pasolini observed that the kind of purity which he perceived in the pre-industrial popular culture was rapidly vanishing, a process that he named  la scomparsa delle lucciole  (lit. "" the disappearance of glow-worms ""). The  joie de vivre  of the boys was being rapidly replaced with more  bourgeois  ambitions such as a house and a family. He described the  coprophagia  scenes in  Sal  as a comment on the processed food industry.   He was angered by economic  globalization  and the cultural domination of the  North of Italy  (around  Milan ) over other regions, especially the South. He felt this was accomplished through the power of  TV . He opposed the gradual disappearance of Italian  dialects  by writing some of his poetry in  Friulian , the regional language of his childhood. Despite his left-wing views, Pasolini opposed  abortion  and  radicalism . [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Sexuality   The  glbtq  encyclopedia states the following regarding Pasolini's  homosexuality :     While openly gay from the very start of his career (thanks to a gay sex scandal that sent him packing from his provincial hometown to live and work in  Rome ), Pasolini rarely dealt with homosexuality in his movies. The subject is featured prominently in  Teorema  (1968), where  Terence Stamp 's mysterious God-like visitor seduces the son of an upper-middle-class family; passingly in  Arabian Nights  (1974), in an idyll between a king and a commoner that ends in death; and, most darkly of all, in  Sal  (1975), his infamous rendition of the  Marquis de Sade 's compendium of sexual horrors,  The 120 Days of Sodom . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Quotes   ""If you know that I am an unbeliever, then you know me better than I do myself. I may be an unbeliever, but I am an unbeliever who has a nostalgia for a belief."" (1966)   ""The mark which has dominated all my work is this longing for life, this sense of exclusion, which doesn't lessen but augments this love of life.""

He was the son of a  lieutenant  of the  Italian Army , Carlo Alberto (1892   Rome , December 19, 1958), who had become famous for saving  Benito Mussolini 's life, and an elementary school teacher, married in 1921, Susanna Colussi ( Casarsa , 1891 ) [ citation needed ] , and was named after his paternal uncle. His grandfather was Argobasto dei Conti Pasolini Dall'Onda, born in  Ravenna  in 1870. His family moved to  Conegliano  in 1923 and, two years later, to  Belluno , where another son, Guidalberto, was born. In 1926, however, Pasolini's father was arrested for gambling debts, and his mother moved to her family's house in  Casarsa della Delizia , in the  Friuli  region.   Pasolini began writing poems at the age of seven, inspired by the natural beauty of Casarsa. One of his early influences was the work of  Arthur Rimbaud . In 1933 his father was transferred to  Cremona , and later to  Scandiano  and  Reggio Emilia . Pasolini found it difficult to adapt to all these moves, though in the meantime he enlarged his poetry and literature readings ( Dostoevsky ,  Tolstoy ,  Shakespeare ,  Coleridge ,  Novalis ) and left behind the religious fervor of his early years. In the Reggio Emilia high school he met his first true friend, Luciano Serra. The two met again in Bologna, where Pasolini spent seven years while completing the high school: here he cultivated new passions, including  football . With other friends, including Ermes Parini, Franco Farolfi, Elio Meli, he formed a group dedicated to literary discussions.   In 1939 he graduated and entered the Literature College of the  University of Bologna , discovering new themes like  philology  and  aesthetics  of  figurative arts . He also frequented the local cinema club. Pasolini always showed his friends a virile and strong exterior, totally hiding his interior travail. He took part in the  Fascist  government's culture and sports competitions. In 1941, together with  Francesco Leonetti ,  Roberto Roversi  and others, he attempted to publish a poetry magazine, but the attempt failed due to paper shortages. In his poems of this period, Pasolini started to include fragments in  Friulian , which he had learned from his mother.     [ edit ]   First poetical works   After the summer in Casarsa, in 1941 Pasolini published at his own expense a collection of poems in Friulian,  Versi a Casarsa . The work was noted and appreciated by intellectuals and critics like  Gianfranco Contini ,  Alfonso Gatto  and  Antonio Russi . His pictures had also been well received. Pasolini was chief editor of the  Il Setaccio  (""The Sieve"") magazine, but was fired after conflicts with the director, who was aligned with the Fascist regime. A trip to Germany helped him also to discover the ""provincial"" status of Italian culture in that era. These experiences led Pasolini to rethink his opinion about the cultural politics of Fascism, and to switch gradually to a  Communist  position.   In 1942, the family took shelter in Casarsa, considered a more tranquil place to wait for the conclusion of the  war , a decision common among Italian military families. Here, for the first time, Pasolini had to face the erotic disquiet he had suppressed during his adolescent years. He wrote: ""A continuous perturbation without images or words beats at my temples and obscures me"".   In the weeks before the 8 September  armistice , Pasolini was drafted in  World War II . He was captured and imprisoned by the  Germans . He managed to escape disguised as a peasant, and found his way to Casarsa. Here he joined a group of other young fans of the Friulian language who wanted to give Casarsa Friulian a status equal to that of  Udine , the official regional dialect. From May 1944 they issued a magazine entitled  Stroligt di c da l'aga . In the meantime, Casarsa suffered Allied bombardments and forced enrollments by the  Italian Social Republic , as well as  partisan  activity.   Pasolini tried to remain apart from these events. He and his mother taught students unable to reach the schools in  Pordenone  or  Udine . He experienced his first  homosexual  love for one of his students. At the same time, a  Slovenian  schoolgirl, Pina Kal, was falling in love with Pasolini. On February 12, 1945, his brother Guido was killed in an ambush. Six days later Pasolinia and others founded the Friulian Language Academy ( Academiuta di lenga furlana ). In the same year Pasolini joined the Association for the Autonomy of Friuli. He graduated after completing a final thesis about  Giovanni Pascoli 's works.   In 1946 Pasolini published a small poetry collection,  I Diarii  (""The Diaries""), with the Academiuta. In October he traveled to  Rome . The following May he began the so-called  Quaderni Rossi , handwritten in old school exercise-books with red covers. He completed a drama in Italian,  Il Cappellano . His poetry collection,  I Pianti  (""The cries""), was also published by the Academiuta.     [ edit ]   Adherence to the Italian Communist Party   On January 26, 1947, Pasolini wrote a controversial declaration for the front page of the newspaper  Libert : ""In our opinion, we think that currently only Communism is able to provide a new culture"". The controversy was partially due to the fact he was still not a member of the  Italian Communist Party  (PCI).   He was also planning to extend the work of the Academiuta to other  Romance language  literatures and knew the exiled  Catalan  poet,  Carles Card . After his adherence to the PCI, he took part in several demonstrations and, in May 1949, attended the Peace Congress in  Paris . Observing the struggles of workers and peasants, and watching the clashes of protesters with Italian police, he began to create his first novel.   However, in October of the same year, Pasolini was charged with the corruption of minors and obscene acts in public places. As a result, he was expelled by the Udine section of the Communist Party and lost the teaching job he had obtained the previous year in Valvasone. Living a difficult situation, in January 1950 Pasolini moved to Rome with his mother.   He later described this period of his life as a very difficult one. ""I came to Rome from the Friulian countryside. Unemployed for many years; ignored by everybody; riven by the fear to be not as life needed to be"". Instead of asking for help from other writers, Pasolini preferred to go his own way. He found a job as a worker in the  Cinecitt  studios, and sold his books in the 'bancarelle' (""sidewalk shops"") of Rome. Finally, through the help of the  Abruzzese -language poet  Vittorio Clemente , he found a job as a teacher in  Ciampino , a suburb of the capital.   In these years Pasolini transferred his Friulian countryside inspiration to Rome's suburbs, the infamous  borgate  where poor  proletarian  immigrants lived in often horrendous sanitary and social conditions.     [ edit ]   Success and charges   In 1954, Pasolini, who now worked for the literature section of the Italian state radio, left his teaching job and moved to the Monteverde quarter, publishing  La meglio giovent , his first important collection of dialect poems. His first novel,  Ragazzi di vita  (English:  Boys of Life ), was published in 1955. The work had great success, but was poorly received by the PCI establishment and, most importantly, by the Italian government, which even initiated a lawsuit against Pasolini and his editor, Garzanti.   Though totally exculpated of any charge, Pasolini became a favourite victim of insinuations, especially by the  tabloid press .   In 1957, together with  Sergio Citti , Pasolini collaborated on  Federico Fellini 's film  Le Notti di Cabiria , writing dialogue for the  Roman dialect  parts. In 1960, he made his debut as an actor in  Il gobbo , and co-wrote  Long Night in 1943 .   His first film as director and screenwriter is  Accattone  of 1961, again set in Rome's marginal quarters. The movie again aroused controversy and scandal. In 1963, the episode ""La ricotta"", included in the collective movie  RoGoPaG , was censored, and Pasolini was tried for offence to the Italian state.   During this period, Pasolini was frequently abroad: in 1961, with  Elsa Morante  and  Alberto Moravia  in  India  (where he went again seven years later); in 1962 in  Sudan  and  Kenya ; in 1963, in  Ghana ,  Nigeria ,  Guinea ,  Jordan , and  Palestine  (where he shot the documentary,  Sopralluoghi in Palestina ). In 1970, he traveled again to  Africa  to shoot the documentary,  Appunti per un'Orestiade africana .   The late 1960s and early 1970s were the era of the so-called ""student movement."" Pasolini, though acknowledging the ideological motivations of the students, thought them ""anthropologically middle-class"" and, therefore destined to fail in their attempts at revolutionary change. He went so far as to state, regarding the  Battle of Valle Giulia , which took place in Rome in March, 1968, that he sympathized with the police, as they were ""children of the poor"", while the young militants were exponents of what he called ""left-wing fascism."" His film of that year,  Teorema , was shown at the annual  Venice Film Festival  in a hot political climate, as Pasolini had proclaimed that the festival would be managed by the directors themselves (see also  Works section ).   In 1970, Pasolini bought an old castle near  Viterbo , several kilometers north of Rome, where he began to write his last novel,  Petrolio,  which was never finished. In 1972, he started to collaborate with the extreme-left association  Lotta Continua , producing a documentary,  12 dicembre  concerning the  Piazza Fontana bombing . The following year, he began a collaboration for Italy's most renowned newspaper,  Il Corriere della Sera .   At the beginning of 1975, Garzanti published a collection of critical essays,  Scritti corsari  (""Corsair Writings"").     [ edit ]   Death   Pasolini was brutally murdered by being run over several times with his own car, dying on November 2, 1975 on the beach at  Ostia , near  Rome . Pasolini was buried in Casarsa, in his beloved  Friuli . He was buried wearing the jersey of the Italian Showmen national team, a charity soccer team he founded. [ citation needed ]   Giuseppe Pelosi, a seventeen-year-old  hustler , was arrested and confessed to murdering Pasolini. Thirty years later on May 7, 2005, he retracted his confession, which he said was made under the threat of violence to his family. He claimed that three people ""with a southern accent"" had committed the murder, insulting Pasolini as a ""dirty communist"". [ 1 ]   Following Pelosi's retraction, the investigation into Pasolini's death was reopened. The murder is still not completely explained. Contradictions in Pelosi's statements, a strange intervention by Italian secret services during the investigations, and some lack of coherence in related documents during different parts of the judicial procedures brought some of Pasolini's friends to suspect that it had been a contract killing. [ citation needed ]  His friend  Oriana Fallaci  exposed inefficiency in the investigations, writing in  Europeo  magazine. Many clues suggest that it was unlikely that Pelosi killed Pasolini alone. [ citation needed ]   Other evidence uncovered in 2005 pointed to Pasolini having been murdered by an extortionist. Testimony by Pasolini's friend Sergio Citti indicated that some of the rolls of film from  Sal  had been stolen, and that Pasolini had been going to meet with the thieves after a visit to  Stockholm , November 2, 1975.   Others theorize that Pasolini may have wanted to be killed and staged his death. Proponents of this theory include Pasolini's lifelong friend painter and writer Giuseppe Zigaina. Zigaina claims that ""Pasolini himself was the 'organizer' of his own death, which, conceived as a form of expression, was intended to give meaning to his entire oeuvre."" [ 2 ]  Zigaina argued that Pasolini had been planning his death for many years and planted codes in his works that revealed when and how it would happen. Alberto Moravia also found striking similarities between Pasolini's death and his work. In 1977, Moravia wrote a book about the murder. He said he recognized the Ostia murder scene from Pasolini's descriptions of similar landscapes in his two novels  Ragazzi di vita (The Ragazzi)  and  Una vita violenta (A Violent Life) , and in an image from his first film  Accattone . Pasolini shot footage of the site a year earlier, for use in his film  Il fiore delle mille e una notte (A Thousand and One Nights) . Unlike Zigaina, however, Moravia considered those similarities as no more than poetic irony. [ 3 ]   Despite the Roman police's reopening of the murder case following Pelosi's statement of May 2005, the judges charged with investigating it determined the new elements insufficient for them to continue the inquiry.   On the 30th anniversary of his death in 2005,  Mario Verger  released an animated biographical cartoon, entitled  Pasolini requiem , with passages drawn from  Mamma Roma ,  Uccellacci e uccellini , and  La Terra vista dalla Luna . It ends with a description of the Ostia murder.     [ edit ]   Works   Pasolini's first novel  Ragazzi di vita  (1955) dealt with the Roman  lumpen proletariat . The resulting  obscenity  charges against him were the first of many instances where his  art  provoked legal problems.  Accattone  (1961), also about the  Roman  underworld, also provoked controversy with conservatives, who demanded stricter  censorship .   He then directed the black-and-white  The Gospel According To St. Matthew  (1964). This film is widely hailed as the best cinematic adaptation of the life of  Jesus  ( Enrique Irazoqui ). Whilst filming it, Pasolini vowed to direct it from the ""believer's point of view"", but later, upon viewing the completed work, saw he had instead expressed his own beliefs.   In his  1966  film,  Uccellacci e uccellini  (literally  Bad Birds and Little Birds  but translated in English as  The Hawks and the Sparrows ), a picaresque - and at the same time mystic - fable, he hired the great Italian  comedian   Tot  to work with one of his preferred ""naif"" actors,  Ninetto Davoli . It was a unique opportunity for Tot to demonstrate that he was a great dramatic actor as well.   In  Teorema  ( Theorem , 1968), starring  Terence Stamp  as a mysterious stranger, he depicted the sexual coming-apart of a  bourgeois  family (later repeated by  Franois Ozon  in  Sitcom ).   Later movies centered on sex-laden  folklore , such as  Boccaccio 's  Decameron  (1971) and  Chaucer 's  Canterbury Tales  (1972), and  Il fiore delle mille e una notte  (literally  The Flower of 1001 Nights , released in English as  Arabian Nights , 1974). These films are usually grouped as the  Trilogy of Life . His final work,  Sal  ( Sal, or the 120 Days of Sodom , 1975), exceeded what most viewers could then stomach in its explicit scenes of intensely sadistic violence. Based on the novel  120 Days of Sodom  by the  Marquis de Sade , it is considered his most controversial film. In May 2006,  Time Out ' s Film Guide named it the Most Controversial Film of all time.     [ edit ]   Significance   As a director, Pasolini created a  picaresque   neorealism , showing a sad reality. Many people did not want to see such portrayals in artistic work for public distribution.  Mamma Roma  (1962), featuring  Anna Magnani  and telling the story of a prostitute and her son, was an affront to the morality of those times. His works, with their unequaled poetry applied to cruel realities, showing that such realities are less distant from us than we imagine, made a major contribution to change in the Italian psyche. [ citation needed ]   The director also promoted in his works the concept of ""natural sacredness,"" the idea that the world is holy in and of itself. He suggested there was no need for spiritual essence or supernatural blessing to attain this state. Pasolini was an avowed  atheist .   General disapproval of Pasolini's work was perhaps caused primarily by his frequent focus on sexual mores, and the contrast between what he presented and publicly sanctioned behavior. While Pasolini's poetry often dealt with his same-sex love interests, this was not the only, or even main, theme. Much of the poetry was about his highly revered mother. As a sensitive and intelligent man, he depicted certain corners of the contemporary reality as few other poets could do. His poetry was not as well-known as his films outside Italy. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Legacy and honors   His films won awards at the  Berlin Film Festival ,  Cannes Film Festival ,  Venice Film Festival , Italian National Syndicate for Film Journalists,  Jussi Awards , Kinema Junpo Awards, International Catholic Film Office and  New York Film Critics Circle .     [ edit ]   Political views   Pasolini generated heated public discussion with controversial analyses of public affairs. For instance, during the disorders of 1969, when the  autonomist  university students were carrying on a guerrilla-like uprising against the police in the streets of Rome and all the leftist forces declared their complete support for the students, describing the disorders as a civil fight of proletariat against the System, Pasolini, alone among the communists, declared that he was with the police; or, more precisely, with the policemen. He considered them true proletariat, sent to fight for a poor salary and for reasons which they could not understand, against pampered boys of their same age, because they had not had the fortune of being able to study, referring to  poliziotti figli di proletari meridionali picchiati da figli di pap in vena di bravate  (lit.  policemen, sons of proletarian southerners, beaten up by arrogant daddy's boys  ). This ironic statement, however, did not stop him from contributing to the autonomist  Lotta continua  movement.   Pasolini was also an ardent critic of  consumismo , i.e.  consumerism , which he felt had rapidly destroyed Italian society in the late 1960s/early 1970s. He was particularly concerned about the class of the  subproletariat , which he portrayed in  Accattone , and to which he felt both sexually and artistically drawn. Pasolini observed that the kind of purity which he perceived in the pre-industrial popular culture was rapidly vanishing, a process that he named  la scomparsa delle lucciole  (lit. "" the disappearance of glow-worms ""). The  joie de vivre  of the boys was being rapidly replaced with more  bourgeois  ambitions such as a house and a family. He described the  coprophagia  scenes in  Sal  as a comment on the processed food industry.   He was angered by economic  globalization  and the cultural domination of the  North of Italy  (around  Milan ) over other regions, especially the South. He felt this was accomplished through the power of  TV . He opposed the gradual disappearance of Italian  dialects  by writing some of his poetry in  Friulian , the regional language of his childhood. Despite his left-wing views, Pasolini opposed  abortion  and  radicalism . [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Sexuality   The  glbtq  encyclopedia states the following regarding Pasolini's  homosexuality :     While openly gay from the very start of his career (thanks to a gay sex scandal that sent him packing from his provincial hometown to live and work in  Rome ), Pasolini rarely dealt with homosexuality in his movies. The subject is featured prominently in  Teorema  (1968), where  Terence Stamp 's mysterious God-like visitor seduces the son of an upper-middle-class family; passingly in  Arabian Nights  (1974), in an idyll between a king and a commoner that ends in death; and, most darkly of all, in  Sal  (1975), his infamous rendition of the  Marquis de Sade 's compendium of sexual horrors,  The 120 Days of Sodom . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Quotes   ""If you know that I am an unbeliever, then you know me better than I do myself. I may be an unbeliever, but I am an unbeliever who has a nostalgia for a belief."" (1966)   ""The mark which has dominated all my work is this longing for life, this sense of exclusion, which doesn't lessen but augments this love of life."" (Interview in documentary, late 1960s)     [ edit ]   Filmography     [ edit ]   Feature films   All titles listed below were written and directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini unless stated otherwise. Although obviously  Oedipus Rex  and  Medea  are loosely based on plays by  Sophocles  and  Euripides  respectively, significant liberties were taken with original texts and titles do not credit anyone except Pasolini.

If using a mac, you need Flip for Mac.  I suggest you download the whole program, then watch.  You can save on your desktop until you shut down.   I learned about it in a chat at About Italian.

January 15, 2009 at 9:25 pm (7)   Peter Cole  says:    While Rai Click worked perfectly with a Mac, today all the content was switched to RAI.TV, and nothing works.  Has anyone discovered how to run the RAI.tv site from a Mac?  I have tried 4 or 5 browsers, with no success.  In each case I get a message from the Quicktime Player that the URL is invalid.       January 15, 2009 at 9:57 pm (8)   Peter  says:    For those of you who are not succeeding in receiving programs in  Italian on your Mac due to the switch from Rai Click to Rai.tv, the following works for me.   1) Open System preferences (Apple Menu) and click on the Flip for Mac icon.  2) UNCLICK the box that says Launch Quicktime Player (or similar).  3) Close System Preferences.  3) Go to RAI.tv and choose your program.   You will see the show in the Flip for Mac Player, not the Quicktime Player.  This might be OK for most users, but if you have upgraded to Quicktime Pro, you are used to having a full screen mode.  To get that you need one more step:   4) In the lower right hand corner of the player there is a down arrow.  Click that arrow and choose “Save as Quicktime Movie.”   5) When that save is complete (it is VERY slow), you can click on the saved quicktime movie and watch the movie in the Quicktime Player, including in full screen mode.

In 1997 the Hochschule Liechtenstein introduced the European Union SOCRATES / ERASMUS system for transferring and accumulating credits  (ECTS - European Credit Transfer System. The basis is the workload required of students to reach the academic programme goals, best reflected in the form of academic achievement and acquired expertise. It facilitates the quantifying and qualifying of academic achievement demonstrated at host universities or in cases where an assessment is required following a transfer to the Hochschule Liechtenstein. The host university or former home university must, however, also employ ECTS. The Hochschule Liechtenstein  ECTS Course Catalogue  provides complete information necessary for studying at the Hochschule Liechtenstein. It also supplies Hochschule Liechtenstein students with essential ECTS information for understanding the system and using it in connection with a semester abroad. Academic achievements demonstrated in a degree programme are attested in a  Diploma Supplement .

Leonardo's Last Supper: Eel Meal the Real Deal?   Scholar Proposes Artist Included Fish in Famous Italian Fresco   ©   Stan Parchin   Oct 2, 2008               In Winter 2008's issue of ""Gastronomica,"" John L. Varriano conjectures that the repast on the table of Leonardo da Vinci's ""Last Supper "" includes eel and orange slices.       In his erudite five-page and color-illustrated study, Varriano, the Idella Plimpton Kendall Professor of Art at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, speculates at some length about certain foods depicted by the Italian Renaissance  master  (1452-1519) in his famous  fresco  (ca. 1495-98). The scholar proposes that the artist painted grilled eel garnished with orange slices, common in parts of Renaissance Italy, on the Eucharistic table of Jesus Christ and his apostles.   Last Supper : Creation and Restoration   Leonardo painted his  Last Supper , commissioned by Milan's Duke  Ludovico Sforza  (1452-1508), on the back wall of the  refectory  of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie. The combination of the inquisitive artist's experimental painting techniques and the dining hall's humidity greatly accelerated the fresco's deterioration shortly after its completion. The oil and tempera on plaster work's most recent restoration, completed in 1999, stemmed the mural's degeneration and revealed the composition's true colors. Details of the table's objects, previously obscured by accumulated layers of overpaint, lacquer and soot, were uncovered after the restorers' extensive treatment.   Marine Cuisine   In  At Supper with Leonardo , John Varriano contends that in the artist's  Last Supper , the meal in front of Christ and his disciples is not one of bread or Pascal lamb, but in fact a menu that included grilled eel with a garnish of orange slices. It was not uncommon for Renaissance artists to portray Biblical figures in 15th-century attire to make them more spiritually relevant to those who observed them. If Varriano's thesis is correct, this style of artistic expression could apply to the presumed fish dish, a popular Renaissance repast in regions of the Italian peninsula, resting on three serving plates that Leonardo painted on the table's right-hand side.   Leonardo da Vinci is known to have composed at least one dozen grocery lists that included eel, bread and fruit. Perhaps what Dr. Varriano discerns as eel on Christ's table in the artist's  Last Supper  is a reflection of Leonardo's own culinary preferences. According to one inventory, the prolific polymath possessed a copy of  De honesta voluptate et valetudine  or  On Right Pleasure and Good Health  (1470), a cookbook of sorts compiled by Bartolomeo Sacchi, called  Platina  (1421-1481). The author and revered tutor of the Gonzaga of Mantua, eventually appointed prefect of the Vatican Library by Pope Sixtus IV della Rovere (r. 1471-1484), included a number of recipes for  anguilla  (eel) in his text.   Toward a New Understanding of Leonardo's Symbolism   John Varriano proposes that Leonardo's presumed introduction of eels into the  Last Supper  was iconographically consonant with the Early Christian imagery of fish, a centuries-old symbol identified with the Savior. He also notes that the snakelike creatures from the shores of Comacchio, near the Duchy of Ferrara, were popular with Renaissance Italians because once captured, they could survive for days without water and also be preserved in brine before preparation for consumption. The author concludes that Leonardo forsook historical accuracy for contemporary realism in his mural, having substituted non-kosher eel for the traditional meal of lamb, bitter herbs and sweet pasty haroset   Once again, despite scientific restoration and intense study, Leonardo da Vinci's  Last Supper  has managed to elude precise interpretation by modern scholars of Italian Renaissance art and culture. If indeed Leonardo incorporated eels into his masterpiece, perhaps they were a subtle pictorial reference to Beatrice d'Este (1475-1497), the bride of Duke Ludovico Sforza (Leonardo's ruthless Milanese patron) and a native of Ferrara, the region from where the serpentine fish was acquired for court consumption.

He worked as a sculptor and architect, and also painted a small number of pictures. He kept voluminous notebooks and wrote on many topics, with plans to publish treatises on painting, anatomy, mechanics, and water, among others. He is also left notes on geometry, bronze casting, ancient weapons, a bestiary, riddles, fables, and more, and was famed for his inventions. Although regarded as a Florentine artist, he worked mostly in Milan, as a military engineer for the Sforzas, and died in France at the court of Francis I.

In it Leonardo brilliantly succeeded in envisaging and reproducing the tormented anxiety of the apostles to know who had betrayed their master.""    The  Last Supper     Giorgio Vasari on Leonardo's  Last Supper    (scroll down)        Leonardo's  Mona Lisa      The portrait now in the Louvre is believed to be the same one that Vasari says Leonardo took to France with him. Upon Leonardo's death in 1519 it was there acquired by François I, the King of France, and later, as part of the royal collection, became part of the Louvre Museum. The portrait purportedly shows Mona Lisa, who had married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanoli del Giocondo in 1495. The portrait is also known by the title ""La Gioconda,"" after the surname of Mona Lisa's husband. Scholars have concluded that Leonardo worked on the portrait over a long period, starting around 1505-1506 in Florence. It was finished perhaps during Leonardo's stay in Milan or Rome.        Leonardo's  Mona Lisa        Leonardo's Writings      In his quest for knowledge, driven by a remarkable curiosity, Leonardo kept many notebooks filled with his own observations, explanations, comments, notes, outlines, musings, and jottings, many accompanied by pen-and-ink drawings, sketches, plans, diagrams, and preparatory studies. Most of Leonardo's notebooks have have been lost, but a number are preserved today in libraries and private collections. Leonardo was left-handed, and in order to facilitate his note-taking, he wrote in mirror-writing, from right to left.                        Further Reading          Richard A.
