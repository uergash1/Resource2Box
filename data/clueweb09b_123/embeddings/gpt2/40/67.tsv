Twenty Useful Tips To Help You Quit Smoking       1. Taking 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda 3 times a day will help you quit smoking.

Eating lots of salads and other fruits will also help. Avoid meat and alcohol.   3.

By Judy Brown   I often hear people say that they have smoked for so long that they can?t see what good it would do to quit now. So what is the big deal if you quit smoking? Will it do you any good or is it a pointless exercise in futility?   My answer always is that the benefits of quitting smoking are enormous. Here are some powerful reasons for quitting: The excess risk of developing heart disease as a result of smoking may be reduced by as much as half in the year or two after quitting. After 15 years, the former smoker's risk of heart disease approaches that of a person who has never smoked. Five to 15 years after quitting the risk of stroke returns to the level of those who have never smoked.>>> Read Full Article    ..........................................................................................................

Smoking is the number ONE preventable cause of premature death and morbidity in America. There is nothing more dangerous you can be doing to your health. And it isn?t just bad for you, smoking around your kids can cause severe health complications down the road and cause serious damage while their lungs and other vital organs are developing. All of this information is well documented by the AMA, American Lung and Heart Associations, and the American Cancer Society. >>> Read Full Article   ..........................................................................................................       What a Single Cigarette Can Do to Your Health      An average of 400,000 Americans die each year from frequently smoking cigarettes. This vast number implies that in every five deaths that occur in America one is caused by cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoking has also set a new mortality trend on modern day American society. It is roughly estimated that within 1960 and 1990, lung cancer deaths brought about by frequent cigarette smoking among women have exceeded breast cancer deaths by an astounding 400% during the mid-80's.     With these disturbing figures, you might find it alarming how a simple cigarette stick could inflict such damage over a huge number of the American population. Most smokers may be aware of the major risks and complications attributed to frequent cigarette smoking. What they lack, however, is knowledge that a simple cigarette practically inflicts varying degrees of damage on each vital part of the human body.    Lung cancer, emphysema, and bronchitis - these are the typical chronic diseases that are equated to smoking cigarettes. However, having knowledge about these three chronic diseases brought about by cigarette smoking is like scratching the mere surface of a looming greater damage that cigarette smoking is capable of. One major recipient of the fatal blow of cigarette smoking is the heart. The implications of cigarette smoking on the human cardiovascular system are quite vast: it lessens the HDL cholesterol, or which is commonly called as the ""good"" cholesterol, which is responsible for keeping a balance well-being of the heart. Frequent cigarette smoking also diminishes the elastic capabilities of the largest blood vessel in the body, the aorta, which increases the chances of fostering blood clots. Plus, have you ever heard anyone say that they smoke to release stress? This is usually the answer of most smokers; however, contrary to being a means of alleviating stress, smoking does the complete opposite.  Taking a single puff from a stick of cigarette dramatically increases the sympathetic nervous system's activity which in effect, creates more stress on the regulating system of the heart and blood vessels. Women smokers, on the other hand, face a much riskier condition because cigarette smoking diminishes the production of estrogen, which then increases the probability of having some form of cardiovascular ailments.    Other than the apparent negative effects of cigarette smoking to the lungs and the cardiovascular system, your bones and joints also face the same damage from constant smoking. Frequent cigarette smoking hampers the formation of new bones. But the most disturbing part of this is that women are most prone to this kind of damage. Women smokers involve themselves with a very high risk of developing osteoporosis and they are also vulnerable to fostering a case of rheumatoid arthritis. In general, however, both men and women smokers are susceptible to various degenerative disorders that can also lead to damages to the spine. Aside from bone and joint damages, constant cigarette smoking is also capable of causing peptic ulcers by reducing the production of prostaglandin and bicarbonate which in turn dramatically increases the acid secretion of the body. The mere act of holding a stick of cigarette in your mouth already poses dangers that may lead to mouth infections, bad breath, and tooth decay. Simply put, smoking cigarettes at a frequent period, radically affects your over-all well-being. Now, the best move or path that one must take is that path towards a cigarette smoking-free life.     To make your journey towards this path a lot easier, be sure that you employ the help of the  Cig-Arette System .  Being an active cigarette smoker for a very long period of time, the mere thought of quitting is capable enough to make you cringe. It is very true that quitting such nasty habit is one tough task; however, with the aid of the  Cig-Arette System , which involves undergoing a seven-day program, kicking off this vice can be quite easy. Unlike the common methods or cigarette substitute such as nicotine gums and nicotine patches,  Cig-Arette System  is compromised of organic and natural components only, that are proven to help you curb down on your cigarette dependence. In this way, you are completely free from any form or dose of nicotine that most of these conventional substitutes contain.  All it takes are 7-days of pure devotion to the program, and you will find yourself more rejuvenated and free from the nasty effects that cigarette smoking can bring.    Cigarette smoking is probably one of the most pointless activities that man ever came up with. You gain nothing from it except a swarm of harmful diseases that can eventually lead to death. Basically, the act of smoking gains you nothing but takes everything from you. Whatever your reasons are for opting to smoke cigarettes, it doesn't change the fact that you're pulling yourself into a downward spiral of death that is completely meaningless and futile.  Thus, through the act of unfastening the firm hold of cigarette smoking on your body, you profess that you value life and the other lives that coincide with yours.                After 3 hours, I really did Quit!

If you have made the decision to quit smoking, congratulations! Not only will you improve your own health, you will also protect the health of your loved ones by no longer exposing them to secondhand smoke.               We know how hard it can be to quit smoking. Did you know that many people try to quit two or three times before they give up smoking for good? Nicotine is a very addictive drug—as addictive as heroin and cocaine. The good news is that millions of people have given up smoking for good. It's hard work to quit, but you can do it! Freeing yourself of an expensive habit that is dangerous to your health and the health of others will make you feel great!               Many women who smoke worry that they will gain weight if they quit. In fact, nearly 80 percent of people who quit smoking do gain weight, but the average weight gain is just five pounds. Keep in mind, however, that 56 percent of people who continue to smoke will gain weight too. The bottom line: The health benefits of quitting far exceed any risks from the weight gain that may follow quitting.                            How to Quit               Research has shown that these five steps will help you to quit for good:                               Pick a date to stop smoking.  Before that day, get rid of all cigarettes, ashtrays, and lighters everywhere you smoke. Do not allow anyone to smoke in your home. Write down why you want to quit and keep this list as a reminder.                 Get support from your family, friends, and coworkers.  Studies have shown you will be more likely to quit if you have help. Let the people important to you know the date you will be quitting and ask them for their support. Ask them not to smoke around you or leave cigarettes out.  Get more support ideas .                  Find substitutes for smoking and vary your routine.  When you get the urge to smoke, do something to take your mind off smoking. Talk to a friend, go for a walk, or go to the movies. Reduce stress with exercise, meditation, hot baths, or reading. Try sugar-free gum or candy to help handle your cravings. Drink lots of water and juices. You might want to try changing your daily routine as well. Try drinking tea instead of coffee, eating your breakfast in a different place, or taking a different route to work.                 Talk to your doctor or nurse about medicines to help you quit.  Some people have withdrawal symptoms when they quit smoking. These symptoms can include depression, trouble sleeping, feeling irritable or restless, and trouble thinking clearly. There are medicines to help relieve these symptoms. Most medicines help you quit smoking by giving you small, steady doses of nicotine, the drug in cigarettes that causes addiction. Talk to your doctor or nurse to see if one of these medicines may be right for you:                                      nicotine patch : worn on the skin and supplies a steady amount of nicotine to the body through the skin                      nicotine gum or lozenge : releases nicotine into the bloodstream through the lining in your mouth                      nicotine nasal spray : inhaled through your nose and passes into your bloodstream                      nicotine inhaler : inhaled through the mouth and absorbed in the mouth and throat                      bupropion : an antidepressant medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the urge to smoke                      varenicline (Chantix™) : a medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the pleasurable effects of smoking                                                   Be prepared for relapse.  Most people relapse, or start smoking again, within the first three months after quitting. Don't get discouraged if you relapse. Remember, many people try to quit several times before quitting for good. Think of what helped and didn't help the last time you tried to quit. Figuring these out before you try to quit again will increase your chances for success. Certain situations can increase your chances of smoking. These include drinking alcohol, being around other smokers, gaining weight, stress, or becoming depressed. Talk to your doctor or nurse for ways to cope with these situations.                              Where to Get Help               Get more help if you need it.

First and foremost, set a quit date and quit COMPLETELY on that day. To prepare for that day: Identify the times you are most likely to smoke. For example, do you tend to smoke when feeling stressed? When you are out at night with friends? While you are drinking coffee or alcohol? When you are bored? While you are driving? Keep a diary to help you determine such risky times. Record each time you have a cigarette, including time of day and what you are doing. Make a plan about what you will do instead of smoking at those times when you are most likely to smoke. For example, drink tea instead of coffee -- tea may not trigger the desire for a cigarette. Or, take a walk when feeling stressed. Remove ashtrays and cigarettes from the car. Place pretzels or hard candies there instead. Pretend-smoke with a straw. Let all of your friends, family, and co-workers know of your plan to stop smoking and your quit date. Just being aware that they know can be a helpful reminder and motivator. Before your quit date, start reducing your cigarette use, including decreasing the number and strength of the cigarettes. However, DON'T do this simply to make your diary ""look good!"" Get rid of all of your cigarettes just before the quit date and clean out anything that smells like smoke, such as clothes and furniture. Other tips to help you quit smoking and stick to it: Enroll in a smoking cessation program (hospitals, health departments, community centers, and work sites often offer programs). Ask your health care provider for advice, including whether prescription medications (such as bupropion -- Zyban or Wellbutrin, or varenicline -- Chantix) are safe and appropriate for you. Find out about nicotine patches, gum, and sprays. Try hypnosis -- it works for some people. Avoid smoke-filled settings and situations in which you are more likely to smoke. Exercise to relieve urges to smoke. The American Cancer Society  is an excellent resource for smokers who are trying to quit, and the Great American Smokeout can help some smokers kick the habit. Above all, don't get discouraged if you aren't able to quit smoking the first time. Nicotine addiction is a hard habit to break. Try something different next time.

Although responsible for around  440,000 deaths each year , cigarettes and tobacco related products can be purchased at almost every corner store, supermarket, or liquor store in the country.      Because of the variety of  health problems  that are linked to smoking, the majority of those people would love to be able to quit [1] . But as with any addictive habit, this is often  easier said than done . People who quit smoking often experience severe  withdrawal symptoms  (both physical and mental) - making it hard for them to stick with their goal of quitting completely. [2]     But quitting smoking is  not  impossible.  Thousands of people successfully quit smoking each year . The following information is designed to help guide you through some of the most effective ways to quit smoking and to provide you with links to some of the best online resources for those that truly want to become smoke free.      Things to Keep in Mind        Try and pick a good time to quit . Don't try to quit during the holidays, during finals week, right before a big presentation, or any other time where stress levels are heightened. This will decrease your chances of success and give you an excuse to start smoking again.   You may gain a small amount of weight when quitting smoking. This is normal.  Most people gain between 5 to 10 pounds after quitting  due to the decreased metabolism that quitting nicotine can cause. [3]  Weight gains of more than 10 pounds are usually caused by people substituting food for cigarettes in their diet.  Be prepared to try quitting more than once . Most people are not fully successful the first time they try and need to attempt it a couple of times before they finally quit for good. Don't get discouraged if you aren't successful at first. Like anything worth doing, it may take you a few tries to get it right.      Step 1: Prepare to Quit      Quit Day!   Set a quit date . Decide on a day within the next two weeks in which you will stop smoking entirely. You may want to pick a day that has added significance, such as your birthday, wedding anniversary, or the first day of the New Year. If you smoke at work, you may want to consider quitting on the weekend, a vacation, or on a day off.  Remove all tobacco products , ashtrays, lighters and matches from your home, car and office. Having even one pack of cigarettes at your home will make it that much easier to start smoking again.   Notify friends and family  that you plan on quitting. Warn them that you may be irritable or have mood swings for a week or two. Ask them to be patient and supportive during the process. If someone close to you smokes, ask that they refrain from smoking around you (or even better - suggest that they try quitting with you).   Talk to your doctor  about your decision to quit smoking. [4]  Find out if this may have any affects on the medications you are currently taking. You may also want to inquire about medications that may help you overcome the withdrawal symptoms of quitting smoking.      Step 2: Find Medications to Help You Quit Smoking   ( Note:  All of the medications described in this section have been  FDA approved  for smoking cessation) [5]     Varenicline:  Marketed under the brand name  Chantix ,  Varenicline  is a prescription-only medication that helps smokers by blocking the rewarding effects of nicotine, while also helping people deal with the withdrawal symptoms of quitting. For more information, see the  Official Site .  Bupropion SR:  Also known as  Zyban  or  Wellbutrin ,  Bupropion  is a medication that is designed to help reduce nicotine cravings and may also relieve symptoms of depression that some people may feel when quitting. Burpropion is not recommended for those with a history of eating disorders or seizures.      Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRT)      Nicotine Patch   Patch:  A nicotine patch is a  Transdermal Patch  which releases a steady stream of nicotine into your bloodstream through your skin. Patches are usually used for a designated period of time (16-24 hours) and are available in differing strengths (depending on how many cigarettes you smoked). One of the benefits of the patch is that it provides a constant stream of nicotine to the system so that nicotine levels in your system stay consistent throughout the day.       Amazon:  Nicotine Patches   (Partner)          Nicotine Gum   Gum:   Nicotine gum  is a replacement therapy that allows nicotine to be delivered to the bloodstream by being absorbed by the tissues in your mouth. Users of nicotine gum may chew anywhere from 10 to 30 pieces a day, or may just have one anytime they feel a craving to smoke. Just like the patch, nicotine gum is available in different strengths. Nicotine gum often works well for people who have an oral fixation, or a psychological dependence on the physical act of smoking.        Amazon:  Nicotine Gum   (Partner)       Nicotrol Nicotine Inhaler   Inhaler:  A  Nicotine inhaler  allows the user to take small puffs of nicotine (as needed) from a small inhaler, without the harmful Carbon Monoxide found in cigarette smoke. Good for administering small doses of nicotine when cravings arrive. Also, inhalers also help by mimicking the act of raising a cigarette to your lips.       Commit Nicotine Lozenge   Lozenge:   Nicotine lozenges  come in the form of a hard candy which slowly dissolves in your mouth while releasing nicotine into your bloodstream. As with nicotine gum, lozenges deliver nicotine to the brain quicker than the patch, making it easier to respond to specific and powerful nicotine cravings.      Amazon:  Nicotine Lozenges   (Partner)         Step 3: Surviving Your First Week   Because  most people who start smoking again do so relatively soon after quitting , the first week is crucial to your success. Unfortunately, due to the effects of nicotine withdrawal - and the fact that they haven't yet become accustomed to life without cigarettes - this is also the most difficult period for most people. But, for those that survive the first week without smoking, staying smoke free will get that much easier. Here are a few tips to help you get through the first week:      Cigarette Substitutes      Lollipops   Because your mind and body have become accustomed to the physical act of smoking (holding the cigarette in your hand - putting it to your lips - taking a puff), it is often helpful to have a number of  items to substitute in their place . Whenever you feel a craving come on, use one of these items to help with the physical cravings of wanting a cigarette:    Toothpicks  Lollipops   Carrot  or  Celery  sticks  Sunflower seeds   Chewing Gum   Mints   Coffee Stirrers      Behavioral Changes   When looking back at your past as a smoker, you will begin to notice certain  behaviors and activities  that were directly linked - in one way or another - to smoking.     Coffee and Cigarettes Take a minute to think about the things in your life that usually involved smoking a cigarette - either before, after or during. Try to recognize some of the activities that you most commonly associate with smoking cigarettes and see if you can cut back, or eliminate them completely, from your daily routine. Some of these may be harder than others to eliminate, but identifying behaviors that lead to cravings can be a great way to help you predict when you may have a craving so that you can be prepared to deal with it. Here are some of the most common behaviors that people often associate with smoking:          Drinking  alcohol  or  coffee   On work breaks or between classes  During stressful situations  First thing in the morning  While driving  After meals      Dietary Changes      Drink 8 glasses of water a day   Because quitting smoking (and the effects of  nicotine withdrawal ) can wreak havoc on your body chemistry as your body begins to adjust to the decreased levels of nicotine, it is important to tailor your diet so that you provide yourself with the nutrients your body needs to help you feel good during this difficult time. [6]  Here are a few things you can do to help your body adjust:    Drink at least  8 glasses of water each day . This will help flush out the toxins in your body and will keep you hydrated and feeling refreshed.  Instead of  coffee  for breakfast, substitute  juice ,  milk  or  tea .  Caffeine  is a powerful drug and can affect your body's chemistry, as well as your mood.  Eat balanced, well-rounded meals. Avoid fast food, junk food, or any other type of food that could severely increase your  sugar  or  salt  intake.      Exercise   Besides being great for your body, your health, and your general well-being, exercise can also be a great diversion from smoking. You don't need to rush out and join a gym and starting working out 5 hours a day. Small, short bursts of exercise can help you overcome those sudden cravings that come out of nowhere.     Riding a bike  Besides helping with cravings, exercise can also do wonders to improve your overall mood and outlook. Here are a few types of exercise you can do when cravings arise:  1.

A nice, healthy meal Reward yourself  for not smoking by doing something special for yourself. With all of the money you are saving by not buying cigarettes, you should be able to afford to do something fun. Here are a few suggestions:    Take yourself out for a nice meal  Buy yourself some new clothes  Go see a movie  Go see a concert  Buy some new  music       Step 4: Staying Quit   Just because you've gotten through the first week without having a cigarette doesn't mean you're out of the clear yet. In order to eliminate the nicotine that was in your body, your  body produced a higher amount of certain chemicals and hormones . [7]  Even though the nicotine has left your system, your body hasn't quite gotten the message yet and is still producing those chemicals - which can cause continued cravings. That is why it is extremely important that you stay vigilant and continue with the methods that have gotten you this far. Here are a few tips on getting through this second stage and on fighting the continuing battle to stay smoke free:       No Smoking!   Make a list  of all of the reasons you want to quit (i.e. Your health, your family, finances, to impress girls) on a sturdy piece of paper and keep it with you at all times. When you feel a craving come on, take it out and slowly read through each item until you are reminded exactly why you are quitting.   Practice  deep breathing  techniques. When an urge arises, count slowly to ten while taking deep, full breathes of air. Concentrate on a comforting image in your mind and  let yourself work through the craving.   Learn to  recognize and anticipate triggers  - those situations that cause you to want to smoke a cigarette. If you can learn to anticipate those triggers, you will have a better chance of avoiding situations that cause them.  Find out  what relaxes you , helps you release stress, and makes you calm. Maybe it's soothing music, a hot bath,  meditation , prayer, reading a book, or a combination of more than one. Do these things often, especially if you feel a nicotine craving coming on.   Join a  Nicotine support group . Whether it is an in-person group meeting or an online discussion forum, having the support, encouragement and sympathy of other people in your situation will make the process of staying quit much easier. Go to the official site of  Nicotine Anonymous  to find a support group in your area, or see About.com's page on  Quit Smoking Support Groups .  Don't smoke!  Not even one cigarette. Not even a puff. You may be tempted to have just one cigarette to get you through a particularly stressful time, or because it's a special occasion, or any number of other excuses that you can use to justify smoking. Don't do it. This is the surest way to a relapse. Stop and think about all the work you've put in so far and how far you've come. Starting again will send you back to square one.      Stop Smoking Hotlines and Resources      Photo by Andrea Gomolak   One of the best things about quitting smoking  these days  is that there are lots of resources available to help people throughout the quitting process. Government and state sponsored programs have made millions of dollars in resources available to organizations that help individuals quit smoking. Whether you have a quick question on what medications may work best for you, or just need some encouraging words during a difficult period, Stop Smoking hotlines can be a valuable resource people who need professional help. Here are just a few of the resources available:      National Cancer Society   Instant Messaging:    LiveHelp  is an online resource for people who want to get real time information and advice on quitting smoking from a smoking cessation counselor. See their site for hours of operation.

Because of the lack of scientific research that has been done on many of these methods, we here at  Mahalo  can not vouch for the effectiveness of any of these methods. Here are a few of the most common:      Hypnosis      Hypnotherapy   Hypnotherapy  and Self-Hypnosis are methods that are used to help patients break through conditioned behaviors (such as smoking) and to replace them with new behaviors that don't involve harmful activities. During this process, patients are put into a deeply relaxed, sleep-like state of heightened awareness in which they are more susceptible to suggestions or prompting instructions. Certain keywords and phrases are introduced to the person under hypnosis that are aimed at reducing the patient's desire to smoke. There has been much debate about whether or not this method is effective after the hypnosis treatments have stopped. And success may also depend on each individuals natural susceptibility to hypnosis.    Amazon:  Stop Smoking Hypnosis (MP3 Downloads)   (Partner)       Acupuncture      Acupuncture   Acupuncture  is an alternative health technique in which fine needle points are inserted into the skin at different points. Proponents of acupuncture believe that placing needles at specific points on the body can help improve the patient's health and well-being. While acupuncture can lead to the release of  endorphins  into the body, producing a natural high, most health professionals do not believe that acupuncture is an effective long-term method for helping people quit smoking.

Aversion Therapy  is a form of behavioral modification that attempts to reinforce the negative aspects of smoking cigarettes and create negative associations whenever a smoker lights up. Some forms of aversion therapy include the rapid and constant smoking of cigarettes - while concentrating on the unpleasant sensations of smoking, using silver acetate to give cigarettes an unpleasant taste, and even the administering of brief electrical shocks whenever a smoker tries to light a cigarette.      Facts About Nicotine Addiction      Tobacco Crops   Nicotine  is the Psychoactive drug found in Tobacco products that, when ingested, gives the user a mildly euphoric feeling. It is also the chemical which users become addicted to. [8]   Research  has shown that nicotine is as addictive as heroin, cocaine or alcohol. [9]   Nicotine dependence is the   most common form of chemical dependence  in the United States. [10]   The average cigarette contains 1 to 2 mg of nicotine that, when ingested, is  rapidly distributed to the brain  within 10 seconds of inhalation. [11]   Nicotine increases the flow of  Dopamine  to the brain, which causes that ""euphoric"" feeling. [12]       Benefits of Quitting Smoking   Quitting smoking  decreases the risk of  lung cancer ,  heart attacks ,  stroke , chonic lung disease and a variety of other types of cancers. [13]     Quitting smoking  can help stop the effects of tobacco on your appearance, such as: premature wrinkling,  bad breath , stained teeth, yellow fingernails and  gum disease . [14]    Quitting smoking can decrease the health risk to loved ones and those around you. [15]    Quitting smoking can help improve your sense of smell and taste. [16]    With the price of cigarettes at an all-time high, quitting smoking can save you a ton of money. Use this  Smoking Cost Calculator  to see how much you spend on cigarettes, and what you could have bought with that money.

Thousands of people each year begin the difficult process of eliminating cigarettes and tobacco from their lives. Some may try to quit cold turkey, others may need the added help that a nicotine replacement therapy can provide, and some people may turn to alternative therapies to help them quit. But it is important to realize that each person is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. So find out what works best for you, and stick with it as long as you can. And if the first time doesn't work, then try again. Because the benefits of being smoke-free easily outweigh the tough times you will go through to get there. Good Luck!

If you have made the decision to quit smoking, congratulations! Not only will you improve your own health, you will also protect the health of your loved ones by no longer exposing them to secondhand smoke.               We know how hard it can be to quit smoking. Did you know that many people try to quit two or three times before they give up smoking for good? Nicotine is a very addictive drug—as addictive as heroin and cocaine. The good news is that millions of people have given up smoking for good. It's hard work to quit, but you can do it! Freeing yourself of an expensive habit that is dangerous to your health and the health of others will make you feel great!               Many women who smoke worry that they will gain weight if they quit. In fact, nearly 80 percent of people who quit smoking do gain weight, but the average weight gain is just five pounds. Keep in mind, however, that 56 percent of people who continue to smoke will gain weight too. The bottom line: The health benefits of quitting far exceed any risks from the weight gain that may follow quitting.                            How to Quit               Research has shown that these five steps will help you to quit for good:                               Pick a date to stop smoking.  Before that day, get rid of all cigarettes, ashtrays, and lighters everywhere you smoke. Do not allow anyone to smoke in your home. Write down why you want to quit and keep this list as a reminder.                 Get support from your family, friends, and coworkers.  Studies have shown you will be more likely to quit if you have help. Let the people important to you know the date you will be quitting and ask them for their support. Ask them not to smoke around you or leave cigarettes out.  Get more support ideas .                  Find substitutes for smoking and vary your routine.  When you get the urge to smoke, do something to take your mind off smoking. Talk to a friend, go for a walk, or go to the movies. Reduce stress with exercise, meditation, hot baths, or reading. Try sugar-free gum or candy to help handle your cravings. Drink lots of water and juices. You might want to try changing your daily routine as well. Try drinking tea instead of coffee, eating your breakfast in a different place, or taking a different route to work.                 Talk to your doctor or nurse about medicines to help you quit.  Some people have withdrawal symptoms when they quit smoking. These symptoms can include depression, trouble sleeping, feeling irritable or restless, and trouble thinking clearly. There are medicines to help relieve these symptoms. Most medicines help you quit smoking by giving you small, steady doses of nicotine, the drug in cigarettes that causes addiction. Talk to your doctor or nurse to see if one of these medicines may be right for you:                                      nicotine patch : worn on the skin and supplies a steady amount of nicotine to the body through the skin                      nicotine gum or lozenge : releases nicotine into the bloodstream through the lining in your mouth                      nicotine nasal spray : inhaled through your nose and passes into your bloodstream                      nicotine inhaler : inhaled through the mouth and absorbed in the mouth and throat                      bupropion : an antidepressant medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the urge to smoke                      varenicline (Chantix™) : a medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the pleasurable effects of smoking                                                   Be prepared for relapse.  Most people relapse, or start smoking again, within the first three months after quitting. Don't get discouraged if you relapse. Remember, many people try to quit several times before quitting for good. Think of what helped and didn't help the last time you tried to quit. Figuring these out before you try to quit again will increase your chances for success. Certain situations can increase your chances of smoking. These include drinking alcohol, being around other smokers, gaining weight, stress, or becoming depressed. Talk to your doctor or nurse for ways to cope with these situations.                              Where to Get Help               Get more help if you need it. Join a quit-smoking program or support group to help you quit. These programs can help you handle withdrawal and stress and teach you skills to resist the urge to smoke. Contact your local hospital, health center, or health department for information about quit-smoking programs and support groups in your area.

To read the full review and see our findings and results, click on the name of the quit smoking product below.      As you can see from our list, we only chose to include those products that satisfied a majority of our criteria. This year, we only chose to include only the top four over-the-counter quit smoking brands. These four products not only demonstrated high overall effectiveness, but also were easy to use, had low occurrences of side effects, and had a high success rate. All four are also backed by the companies that make them, as evidenced by their 100% money back guarantees.                   Quit Smoking Product Ratings                       1.

This product really has become the ""supplement of choice"" for those looking to quit smoking. Not only did Nicocure prove itself very effective, it was also well-tolerated by all of our test subjects.        Another reason for this products high rank is it's very high success rate, meaning nearly everyone we had try this product saw results to some degree. In fact, a number of respondents experienced reduced withdrawal symptoms to a degree you would normally not expect from an all-natural product. We attribute this to not only the combination of ingredients found in this product but also the quality of these ingredients.        As for the makers of Nicocure, we have nothing but good things to say. They offer a host of convenient customer service and ordering options such as live chat and a 1-800 number.

""I Felt Like I Had Turned into a Monster...""    My Body And Mind Were Focused On One Thing, and One Thing Only...              When the cravings hit me, it felt like nothing else mattered. My family's wants and needs were suddenly irritants and aggravations. Small frustrations, like misplacing my car keys, became massive headaches. I'd snap at my children for no reason.   My short-temperedness would inevitably lead me right where I didn't want to go. It was so inviting, so calming. ""Just one"" I'd tell myself, ""I'll start quitting tomorrow"".    Tomorrow became Monday, Monday became next week...Next week became next month...   The hold that cigarettes have on your body is unmistakable. You start smoking to be part of the ""in"" crowd, but more and more, you begin to feel alienated. You're suddenly ousted and barred from restaurants, buildings and meetings where No Smoking signs glare at you mockingly.   Is There Any Proven, Successful Way to Quit?   You may have tried them all before: Patches, gums, ""cold turkey""...and felt as if nothing worked. But the more you help prepare your body for the realization that it will soon be ""going without"" nicotine, the more likely you are to quit - once and for all. Remember, it's not your lack of dedication or determination that keeps you from quitting, but the vicious hold that nicotine has over your body.   The Symptoms of Withdrawal WILL PASS!   Other smokers will gleefully tell you what you get to look forward to when you try to quit:     Intense cravings   Irritability   Insomnia Fatigue                                                                                            Inability to concentrate   Headache                                                                                                              Cough   Sore Throat   Constipation or other stomach problems     But think of those symptoms in relation to what you put  into  your body when you take a puff. Below are just a few of the thousands of chemicals (and common uses for them) that are dumped into your system every time you smoke a cigarette:     Acetone (nail polish remover)   Arsenic (rat poison)   Butane (lighter fluid)   Cadmium (rechargeable batteries)   Carbon monoxide (car exhaust fumes)   DDT (insecticide)                                                                                      Formaldehyde (used to embalm dead people)   Hydrogen cyanide (gas chamber poison)   Lead   Mercury   Vinyl chloride (plastic piping)                                                                          Here Are a Few All-Natural Ways to Help Your Body Cope!   Stopping smoking is often a difficult task, but within hours, your body will start to repair the damage that cigarettes and nicotine have done to it. To help you get your mind off of craving, try:     Telling yourself that you'll wait 5 more minutes. Usually by this time, the craving has passed!   Call a friend or, better yet,  go for a walk . The fresh air will do wonders for your lungs, and you'll get your mind off wanting that cigarette.   Drink more  water  which will naturally help you feel fuller and help your body flush out the toxins in your bloodstream resulting from cigarettes.   Get more rest. Remember, your body is fighting an addiction. Help it repair and restore its natural balance by giving it the ""downtime"" it needs.   Take  vitamins C, E and B Complex  to help your body get back what the toxins in cigarettes strip away.   Eat  well-balanced meals  to keep your body from moving from one craving (cigarettes) to another (fatty/sugary foods or caffeine).    Reward yourself by relaxing! Take a hot bath, read a good book, or listen to music. If a craving is intense, try some meditative tapes. We have several to choose from in our  Health Books, Audio and Video  department.

If you have made the decision to quit smoking, congratulations! Not only will you improve your own health, you will also protect the health of your loved ones by no longer exposing them to secondhand smoke.               We know how hard it can be to quit smoking. Did you know that many people try to quit two or three times before they give up smoking for good? Nicotine is a very addictive drug—as addictive as heroin and cocaine. The good news is that millions of people have given up smoking for good. It's hard work to quit, but you can do it! Freeing yourself of an expensive habit that is dangerous to your health and the health of others will make you feel great!               Many women who smoke worry that they will gain weight if they quit. In fact, nearly 80 percent of people who quit smoking do gain weight, but the average weight gain is just five pounds. Keep in mind, however, that 56 percent of people who continue to smoke will gain weight too. The bottom line: The health benefits of quitting far exceed any risks from the weight gain that may follow quitting.                            How to Quit               Research has shown that these five steps will help you to quit for good:                               Pick a date to stop smoking.  Before that day, get rid of all cigarettes, ashtrays, and lighters everywhere you smoke. Do not allow anyone to smoke in your home. Write down why you want to quit and keep this list as a reminder.                 Get support from your family, friends, and coworkers.  Studies have shown you will be more likely to quit if you have help. Let the people important to you know the date you will be quitting and ask them for their support. Ask them not to smoke around you or leave cigarettes out.  Get more support ideas .                  Find substitutes for smoking and vary your routine.  When you get the urge to smoke, do something to take your mind off smoking. Talk to a friend, go for a walk, or go to the movies. Reduce stress with exercise, meditation, hot baths, or reading. Try sugar-free gum or candy to help handle your cravings. Drink lots of water and juices. You might want to try changing your daily routine as well. Try drinking tea instead of coffee, eating your breakfast in a different place, or taking a different route to work.                 Talk to your doctor or nurse about medicines to help you quit.  Some people have withdrawal symptoms when they quit smoking. These symptoms can include depression, trouble sleeping, feeling irritable or restless, and trouble thinking clearly. There are medicines to help relieve these symptoms. Most medicines help you quit smoking by giving you small, steady doses of nicotine, the drug in cigarettes that causes addiction. Talk to your doctor or nurse to see if one of these medicines may be right for you:                                      nicotine patch : worn on the skin and supplies a steady amount of nicotine to the body through the skin                      nicotine gum or lozenge : releases nicotine into the bloodstream through the lining in your mouth                      nicotine nasal spray : inhaled through your nose and passes into your bloodstream                      nicotine inhaler : inhaled through the mouth and absorbed in the mouth and throat                      bupropion : an antidepressant medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the urge to smoke                      varenicline (Chantix™) : a medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the pleasurable effects of smoking                                                   Be prepared for relapse.  Most people relapse, or start smoking again, within the first three months after quitting. Don't get discouraged if you relapse. Remember, many people try to quit several times before quitting for good. Think of what helped and didn't help the last time you tried to quit. Figuring these out before you try to quit again will increase your chances for success. Certain situations can increase your chances of smoking. These include drinking alcohol, being around other smokers, gaining weight, stress, or becoming depressed. Talk to your doctor or nurse for ways to cope with these situations.                              Where to Get Help               Get more help if you need it. Join a quit-smoking program or support group to help you quit. These programs can help you handle withdrawal and stress and teach you skills to resist the urge to smoke. Contact your local hospital, health center, or health department for information about quit-smoking programs and support groups in your area.

I smoked, like                       a champion, for all but 10 of my 49 years of living. By the time I finally quit                       last year, I could hardly crawl up a flight of stairs without                       being barely able to catch my breath. Last year I had                       developed a smokers cough so bad that during a hacking fit                       I actually tore a chest muscle. Just a few weeks prior to                       quitting I began waking up in the middle of the night,                       gasping for breath. I had to borrow a friends asthma puffer.                       My teeth were a sickening yellow, my eyes disgustingly dull,                       my skin that ungodly grayish color that branded me ""a                       smoker"" and I always seemed to be the only one at                       social gatherings having to hide somewhere just to                       steal a few puffs. I had tried valiantly to quit twice before,                       but failed miserably.                                                                                                             The                               Tobacco Industry kills more people in North                               America from Monday to Thursday of each week than                               the terrorists murdered in total on Sept. 11, 2001                               Some                               family members and friends had started almost                               pleading with me to 'save my own life' but I was                               totally convinced that after failing to quit                               before, I was a lifelong 'nicotine                               addict' - and would probably be sucking on a                               cigarette with my dying breath. The way I had                               started to feel last year, it seemed like it wouldn't take too                               much longer.                                 In fact, these are                               the untouched words of my eldest daughter, a                               registered nurse, who was the MOST surprised of                               anyone that I had  really  quit smoking for                               good: ""Dad, you know how much I wanted you to quit                               smoking for a long time but especially after the                               birth of Corbin and Cameron. I couldn't be more                               proud of you, and happy for my sons, that their                               grandfather will now be around a lot longer to be a                               great influence in their lives.""  Sara                               N. Wilson RN                                                                                                       Well, this was                       Beneteau - the Smoker, just last year. Coughing, hacking,                       gasping for breath with everyone griping at him to ""just be a                       man and quit!"" But despite even this pressure and how                       bad my health was becoming, another attempt at quitting was not even close to                       being on my radar screen. Ahhh, the seductive power of                       puffing!!                                                                        A Chance Meeting                         In 2003, I met a                       man named  Rick                       Saruna . At the time, I had been looking for a local practitioner of                       NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) and relaxation therapy to help a                       relative of mine through a difficult time. I came across                       Rick and his clinic in my hometown of Windsor, Ontario.                      If you want to                       know the entire truth, Rick was flabbergasted when I                       called the first time as a few weeks prior he had written  my                        name down to contact me after buying a book at a                       conference he had attended in New Hampshire -  my                       company was listed in the book's resource section. So we                       had 2 reasons to meet.                         We met a few                       days later at his clinic and discussed a plan of action                       for my loved one. I noticed that a large part of his                       practice was devoted to helping people quit smoking and he                       claimed a 90% success rate. Knowing what I knew then about                       the horror stories of myself and others who tried to quit                       smoking, I was quite skeptical of this claim. Making one                       of my notoriously off-handed remarks, I commented about my                       being in the 10% -  the stereotypical, weak-minded,                       incurable addict.                         Rick replied SO                       matter-of-factly that the 10% who failed to quit represented those who                       didn't follow his simple program and that in a couple of hours he                       could get me to give up smoking for good!                      He added                       though that this time, I would quit  for good ,                         without  major stress and                         without  suffering through weeks or months of painful cravings and                       withdrawals (that eventually led to my failure before) and                   * without  gaining any extra weight                   whatsoever. In fact he said I would lose weight with his                   program if I wanted to!                         Sure I                       would:-)                                                                                                                                     90%                               of lung cancer occurs in those who have smoked.                               Each package delivers the equivalent of one chest                               x-ray.                                                               Look,                               I wasn't even close to thinking about making yet                               another                               mother-of-all-painful-decisions-to-quit-smoking,                               so Saruna's promise would have been an absolute                               miracle in my case! All he said I had to do to was                               set aside 3 hours of my time and pick the date for                               what I now call                               ""D-Day"", or ""done                               day"". I did just that. Afterall, what                               could having at least a semi-open mind and                               investing 3 hours really cost me in the bigger                               scheme of things?                                                                                                                                                           After                     3 hours, I really did Quit!                       My 9:00 a.m. session with                     Rick lasted 3 hours.                        As an early                     riser I had already been up for 5 hours when I arrived - without a                     cigarette - and I was not in a great                     mood. I believe in the power                     of the mind and all, but at this point I just 'knew what I                     knew' about cigarette addiction and it just felt like this                     exercise would be one of total futility. Actually, I saw myself taking a break to light up                     outside just as soon as I could:-)                       Maybe this is how                     you feel right now. Doubtful? Even skeptical? If that's                     true, I encourage you to                     please, please read on. Everything changed VERY quickly for me from                     this point forward!                     See, I made a commitment to                   at least have an open mind,                     the very same kind of commitment I will be asking you to make                     here, so I started listening to what Rick began telling me - the real truth about my                   addiction to tobacco.                       Everything                     he said soon made a whole lot of sense - including why                     it would be very easy for me to finally quit smoking this                     time.                       You are about to                     read just some of what I was shocked to learn. Afterall, it   IS  these ""truths"" that make the                     difference between smokers being able to quit, and not. And just so you know, I shook my head in                     disbelief at some of these the first time I heard them!                                                                   The Real Deal about Smoking                     and WHY You Can Quit Easily Too!                                                                                                                                                                                   Smoking                             cigarettes is   NOT  a natural or pleasurable thing to                             do. The body rejects it, ie: hack, cough, spit and                             did someone say, horrible taste? Your body tells you                             this is really bad stuff! However, I must have said                             a thousand times, ""I enjoy smoking"" or                             ""that cigarette will taste good right after                             dinner"", but that was because  they   (the                             Tobacco Industry) made                             me believe smoking cigarettes was a natural and                             pleasurable thing to do. What I soon learned was                             that   I really love NOT SMOKING!  You know, lungs full of clean air, tons more energy, no                             shortness of breath, nice bright white teeth,                             increased mental clarity, the amazing taste of foods, a more radiant                             complexion and increased self-esteem simply because                             of being victorious in the war of tobacco addiction!                                                                                                                                           It was  your                             mind  that convinced your body to start smoking                             in the first place so you could look cool/be                             accepted/whatever reason your mind came up with, and                             it is    only      your mind   that can convince                             your body to stop. This  IS  the focal                             point of our program and the reason it really works.                             No other program I am aware of takes  your belief                             system , the most important ingredient in the                             successful quit smoking equation, into consideration                             - hence the staggering failure rate of theirs and                             the  90% success of ours!                                                                                                                                              Here is                             something that has got to shock you - nicotine is  not                              what you are mainly addicted to in cigarettes! The tobacco                             companies and even the government and health care industry                             would have you believe this is true but there is another                             ingredient in the highly guarded, patent protected                             list (imagine that, it's the public's health at                             stake and this is a trade secret!) among  the                             1000's of chemicals  in each cigarette that  really  is the one                             responsible for your addiction - and - the terrible                             struggle for most people to quit. In our program we                             reveal this ingredient (it will amaze you!) and more                             importantly, we teach you how to control and easily                             counteract your addiction to this substance - a                             simple and painless thing to do.                                                                                                                                           While                             every other quit smoking program is                             focused on helping you fight off false cravings for                             nicotine, hundreds of thousands of people who are sincere about quitting are                             sadly spending millions of                             dollars buying up expensive pills, patches, inhalers,                             supplements and gums in a losing battle to save their own lives. Therefore,                              both  the smoking   and  the                             quit-smoking (pharmaceutical) industries (did                             someone say among the largest government lobbies in                             the U.S.?) are raking in billions and billions!                                                                                                                                           The main reason                             people fail to quit (and why it took almost 40 years of                             smoking for me to learn this) is that from the time we were                             little children we have been lied to and literally                             programmed by the powerful tobacco and                             pharmaceutical industries as well as the media to                             believe that we are heavily addicted and cannot quit. Between having you keep                             smoking, and, keep quitting, they have a vested                             interest in keeping you as a dying, sorry I mean paying,                             customer. Not a laughing matter at all but I                             couldn't resist.                                                                                                                     Believe me, no matter how                     strange or ""conspirial"" the above might seem to you                     right now, this will ALL  make total sense  when you experience just                     how easy it is to quit smoking using  The Quit Smoking                     Right Now Program .                                                                    In other words   . . . the proof is                     in the quitting!

One thing I                             know is that not everybody is motivated by the same                             things. One person may be motivated by the fact they                             might  add years to their life  while another may be                             scared by the grim statistics and horrible death                             that so many smokers ultimately face. Still others may be                             motivated by how much money they will save by                             quitting smoking. So, let's spend a few seconds                             talking about saving those thousands of                             dollars.                                                                                                                                        Smoking                     and Stopping Co$T You!                       Here's the money                     you will spend if you continue smoking (and of                     course the price of smoking never goes down). Incidentally,                     with what I am saving on cigarettes, I can take an all                     expense paid vacation for 2 to an exotic island every year!

Consider                 the 1990 Surgeon                     General's Report findings:                                                                                                                       When                             it comes                                right                             down to it,                               aren't                             you tired of                               being                             a slave                               to                             cigarettes?                                                                               After 1 year off                     cigarettes, the excess risk of heart disease and sudden                     death caused by smoking is  reduced by half . After 15                     years of abstinence, the risk of heart disease is similar to                     that of people who've never smoked.                       In 5 to 15                     years, the risk of stroke for ex-smokers returns to the                     level of those who've  never smoked .                       Male smokers who                     quit between ages 35 to 39 can add up to  15 years  to                     their life. Female quitters in this age group can add up to  12                     years . Men and women who quit at ages 65 to 69 increase                     their life expectancy by up to  3 years .                                                                                                                                         And here are some                   amazing facts   about the health benefits you can receive even 20 minutes after quitting.                   It really doesn't                 matter whose stats you read or believe the bottom line for most                 people is the                 same:                    Quitting smoking will probably extend the length and                 definitely improve the                 quality of your life and those around you!                                                                                                                          I believe                         it must also be said that as with all things in life, there                         are exceptions to the normal health issues associated                         with smoking. My aunt smoked almost her entire adult                         life and lived to be 89 years old. A friend of mine's                         close friend drank several martinis while chain smoking                         every day and lived to be 96. Rare cases such as these                         continue to baffle scientists.                                                                                                                                                                        Our                     90% Success Rate, Our 100% Promise!                   Now that I have                 experienced just how easy it really was for a die-hard smoker                 like me to quit, I can see why  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program   can proudly boast a 90%                 success rate. In fact, I wondered why it wasn't higher! But                 again, Rick                 explains this as a simple example of human nature, in that 10%                 of his clients just do not follow the simple steps of his                 program. If they did, he could probably claim a 100% success rate.                       So, for any customer                 who falls into this category and for whatever reason doesn't                 quit smoking in the first pass, we have a fail-safe back-up plan. We will                 send in the reinforcements and come to their rescue.   Our                     promise, and our mission,                 is to have you quit smoking - for Life!                                           What                     would it be worth to you to Take Back Your Life?                       What would the                             freedom of being tobacco-free for the rest of your                             life be worth to you? Interesting question,                     considering the claim we make here, don't you agree?                        In my case, and in all sincerity, I cannot put a                     price on my new found freedom. Neither can my daughters and my mother and my                     siblings and my friends. I feel GREAT physically and I feel                             GREAT spiritually because I quit. This, and the fact                     that it was so easy for me to quit for good was the entire reason                     I decided to stop everything else I was doing to ask Rick Saruna to help me put his program and this                             amazing product together. So, my answer to this                             question is,                     well,  priceless .                       I'm quite sure                     the people whose testimonials you've read who quit smoking                     using  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program , or the hundreds who have                     quit with the clinic program, would feel just as I do.     Speaking of                     which, in his clinic                     practice, Rick's retail price for this program is $800.00.                     Sometimes he has a special promotion where the price                     is reduced to $500.00.                     Thing is, you would not have a personal session with Rick with our digital product   but you also won't have to wait weeks                     for an appointment (my 2 day appt. time was partially                     business and not normal practice for his clinic) - you                     receive everything you would during that session either in                     written or audio form within hours. Plus, you can get  personal help                     by email and  ** even by phone if you require it.                       We also researched and found a wide range of prices for                     stop smoking programs.                     Many cost thousands of dollars and included 'medicines' such                     as the patch, pills, inhalers or gums, and/or supplements,                     all of which are very expensive. You read the approximate                     costs of some of the quit-industry pharmaceutical products a few minutes ago.                       We also had to                     consider that unlike the corner drug store who would not                     likely ever refund you hundreds of dollars on empty packages of                     Nicorettes or a Nicotrol inhaler because you claimed they                     didn't work,   we will refund you every penny  you paid                     us if you don't quit. You will                     soon read this in our 100% money-back guarantee.                       Also, unlike                     most programs that would not likely continue to support you in your quest to quit                     smoking for good after you have paid the price and completed                     the course,  we will !                       Ok, just one                     more thing. Rick and I spent                     the latter part of 2003 and the first part of 2004 putting  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program  together. Between his                     grueling clinic schedule and my crazy Internet hours, a lot                     of 'midnight oil' was burned in order to be able to present                     this amazing program to you. We also decided to have the                     audio portion of this program recorded in a professional                     recording studio, so no ""teleconference or                     headset-to-PC"" quality                     files here:-) Plus, we added some custom-written and                     produced music just to make you feel more                     ""energized"" from the moment you begin to Quit Smoking.                       Mostly though,                     we decided  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program  had to be priced fairly                     and within easy financial reach of every smoker,                     considering what every smoker pays right now for cigarettes                     every day, or, for all the costs associated with all the                     other quit-smoking programs and expensive pharmaceuticals                     and supplements out there.                        So, our  Special                     Introductory Price  to                     have  You Take Your Life Back  by guaranteeing that   You                     Will Quit Smoking Once and for All , is only  $197.00 , or the price of                     your supply of cigarettes at 2 packs a day for a single                     month. That's it!                                                                  I Want To Take Back My Life Right Now!                                                                   The                     Ultimate 'Stress Test'                                     I struggled with                 whether to include the following information in a sales                 presentation because it is based on very personal information                 but I decided that in the end, my desire to help you or a loved                 to quit smoking won out.                    The last part of                 2003 and the beginning of 2004 was very stressful for me. My                 mother was hospitalized for 3 long months with appendicitis, a                 broken foot from falling down when the rupture occurred and                 complications resulting from the toxins being released into her                 80+ year-old body. My youngest daughter was also hospitalized                 having had her normal round of                 seizures, which are always very nasty and physically damaging to                 her. Finally, my elderly aunt, who I had taken care of since                 1993, had fallen and had been alone on the floor for 2 1/2 days                 when I discovered her. Different hospitals all, of course.                   I am a                 ""lifeline"" of sorts to all 3 of my loved ones here and                 although I feel I have fairly broad shoulders, I could not begin                 to explain the level of stress I came to experience dealing with                 the intricacies of, and time associated with, each crucial                 situation. You know, daily visitations, doctor consults,                 specialist appointments, rehab appointments, discharge planner                 appointments etc., and ultimately with my aunt, the long process of                 having to select a nursing home and related services (dozens of                 phonecalls and meetings) etc.                   In January, my                 mother was thankfully released but my daughter was hospitalized                 again and                 then my aunt suffered a massive                 stroke just hours from being                 transported to the nursing home that I and her step daughter                 carefully chose for her, and near the end it became a matter of my                 almost living in the hospital. She passed peacefully on                 Feb. 1, 2004.                    If there ever was a                 time when logic and stress would seemingly dictate that a                 recently-quit smoker would slip up and start smoking again, believe me, it                 would have been anytime during these months! But I can                 honestly tell you that although I had fleeting thoughts of joining                 the few smokers I saw huddled outside the hospital in                 the bitter cold, I never even came close to                 acting upon them. Truth is, based on what I learned in  The Quit                     Smoking Right Now Program , I simply cannot see a                 circumstance under which I would ever go back to smoking                 cigarettes!                    Believe me, before these stressful                 months, I was totally                 convinced of the effectiveness of  The Quit                     Smoking Right Now Program   but while putting the finishing touches                 on this letter I realized just how awesome and truly                 powerful this program really is!                   Now, here's the                 bottom line for you  . . .

First, congratulate yourself. Just reading this article is a huge step toward becoming tobacco free. Many people don't quit smoking because they think it's too hard to do. They think they'll quit someday.    It's true, for most people quitting isn't easy. After all, the nicotine in cigarettes is a powerfully addictive drug. But with the right approach, you can overcome the cravings.    The Difficulty in Kicking the Habit    Smokers may have started smoking because their friends did or because it seemed cool. But they keep on smoking because they became addicted to nicotine, one of the chemicals in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Nicotine is both a stimulant and a depressant. That means nicotine increases the heart rate at first and makes people feel more alert (like caffeine, another stimulant). Then it causes depression and fatigue. The depression and fatigue — and the drug withdrawal from nicotine — make people crave another cigarette to perk up again. According to many experts, the nicotine in tobacco is as addictive as cocaine or heroin.    But don't be discouraged; millions of Americans have permanently quit smoking. These strategies can help you quit, too:    Put it in writing.  People who want to make a change often are more successful when they put it in writing. So write down all the reasons why you want to quit smoking, such as the money you will save or the stamina you'll gain for playing sports. Keep that list where you can see it, and add to it as you think of new reasons.    Get support.  People whose friends and family help them quit are much more likely to succeed. If you don't want to tell your parents or family that you smoke, make sure your friends know, and consider confiding in a counselor or other adult you trust. And if you're having a hard time finding people to support you (if, say, all your friends smoke and none of them is interested in quitting), you might consider joining a support group, either in person or online.    Set a quit date.  Pick a day that you'll stop smoking. Tell your friends (and your family, if they know you smoke) that you're going to quit smoking on that day. Just think of that day as a dividing line between the smoking you and the new and improved nonsmoker you'll become. Mark it on your calendar.       Throw away your cigarettes  —  all   of your cigarettes.  People can't stop smoking with cigarettes still around to tempt them. Even toss out that emergency pack you have stashed in the secret pocket of your backpack. Get rid of your ashtrays and lighters, too.    Wash all your clothes.  Get rid of the smell of cigarettes as much as you can by washing all your clothes and having your coats or sweaters dry-cleaned. If you smoked in your car, clean that out, too.    Think about your triggers.  You're probably aware of the situations when you tend to smoke, such as after meals, when you're at your best friend's house, while drinking coffee, or as you're driving. These situations are your triggers for smoking — it feels automatic to have a cigarette when you're in them. Once you've figured out your triggers, try these tips:      Avoid these situations.  For example, if you smoke when you drive, get a ride to school, walk, or take the bus for a few weeks. If you normally smoke after meals, make it a point to do something else after you eat, like read or call a friend.    Change the place.  If you and your friends usually smoke in restaurants or get takeout and eat in the car, suggest that you sit in the no-smoking section the next time you go out to eat.    Substitute something else for cigarettes.  It can be hard to get used to not holding something and having something in your mouth. If you have this problem, stock up on carrot sticks, sugar-free gum, mints, toothpicks, or even lollipops.      Expect some physical symptoms.  If you smoke regularly, you're probably physically addicted to nicotine and your body may experience some symptoms of withdrawal when you quit. These may include:      headaches or stomachaches    crabbiness, jumpiness, or  depression    lack of energy    dry mouth or sore throat    desire to pig out      Luckily, the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal will pass — so be patient. Try not to give in and sneak a smoke because you'll just have to deal with the symptoms longer.    Keep yourself busy.  Many people find it's best to quit on a Monday, when they have school or work to keep them busy. The more distracted you are, the less likely you'll be to crave cigarettes.  Staying active is also a good way to make sure you keep your weight down and your energy up ,  even as you're experiencing the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.    Quit gradually.  Some people find that gradually decreasing the number of cigarettes they smoke each day is an effective way to quit. However, this strategy doesn't work for everyone — you may find you have to stop completely at once. This is known as ""cold turkey.""    Use a nicotine replacement if you need to.  If you find that none of these strategies is working, you might talk to your doctor about treatments. Using a nicotine replacement, such as gum, patches, inhalers, or nasal sprays, can be very helpful. Sprays and inhalers are available by prescription only, and it's important to see your doctor before buying the patch and gum over the counter. That way, your doctor can help you find the solution that will work best for you. For example, the patch requires the least effort on your part, but it doesn't offer the almost instantaneous nicotine kick that gum does.    If you slip up, don't give up!  Major changes sometimes have false starts. If you're like many people, you may quit successfully for weeks or even months and then suddenly have a craving that's so strong you feel like you have to give in. Or maybe you accidentally find yourself in one of your trigger situations and give in to temptation. If you slip up, it doesn't mean you've failed, it just means you're human. Here are some ways to get back on track:      Think about your slip as one mistake.  Take notice of when and why it happened and move on.    Did you become a heavy smoker after one cigarette?  We didn't think so — it happened more gradually, over time. Keep in mind that one cigarette didn't make you a smoker to start with, so smoking one cigarette (or even two or three) after you've quit doesn't make you a smoker again.    Remind yourself why you've quit and how well you've done  — or have someone in your support group, family, or friends do this for you.      Reward yourself.  As you already know, quitting smoking isn't easy. Give yourself a well-deserved reward! Set aside the money you usually spend on cigarettes. When you've stayed tobacco free for a week, 2 weeks, or a month, buy yourself a treat like a new CD, book, movie, or some clothes. And every smoke-free year, celebrate again. You earned it.

The list below includes several common signs and symptoms of heart attacks. The victim does  not  need to have every item on the list in order to be having a heart attack, but if two or more of the items are present then it is important to  call 911  immediately.   Readers who've experienced a heart attack before know those classic symptoms don't always happen -- or they don't always feel the way we expect them to. If you've had a heart attack, let us know how it felt. Tell your story  below .   The classic symptoms are:    Chest pain  Pressure, heaviness or tightness in the chest  Pain or pressure in the neck or jaw  Pain or pressure in one or both arms (especially the left)  Shortness of breath   Sweating  Nausea  Pain or throbbing between the shoulder blades     If You Suspect You're Having a Heart Attack   If you suspect a heart attack,  do not  make an appointment to see the doctor. A private physician will probably not have the tools necessary to treat a heart attack. Instead,  call 911 immediately!   If you have chest pain, always go to the ER or call 911.   While waiting for the ambulance:      Sit down and rest . The more exercise or stress you put on the heart, the more damage the heart attack will do. Sit and rest until the ambulance arrives.     Have someone gather your medications . If there is someone with you, have them gather your medications or an updated list. It's a good idea to have personal medical information available at all times for the ambulance crew.     Take your nitroglycerin . If you have a prescription for  nitroglycerin , this is why you have it. Take it as directed by your physician. Usually, you put a tablet under your tongue and let it dissolve.  Do not  take another person's nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin can make some people's blood pressure drop dangerously low.    WARNING: Taking nitroglycerin within 36 hours of taking  Viagra® ,  Cialis® , or  Levitra®  (drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction) may cause a sudden drop in blood pressure. Do not take nitroglycerine within 36 hours of taking erectile dysfunction drugs unless directed by a physician.     There are many medical conditions in which calling the doctor is not always the best option. Often, it's better to skip the doctor and call 911 instead. Here are some other medical complaints that tell you  when to call 911 .

OCD Medication: Children                                            When Should Medication Be Considered For Children With OCD?   Medication treatment should only be considered when children are experiencing significant OCD impairment or distress. Also when cognitive-behavioral therapy is unavailable or only partially effective.   Each of the seven available anti-OCD medications is discussed separately on this web page. The following are some general principles that apply to them all:         Anti-OCD medications work because they affect the brain chemical serotonin. Serotonin is used by certain nerve cells in the brain to communicate with other brain cells. These nerve cells (called neurons) release serotonin, which then affects neighboring cells. After the serotonin is released, the serotonin is taken back up into the cell so that it can be used again. Each of the anti-OCD drugs interferes with serotonin being recycled once it has been released. This allows serotonin to spend more time outside of the cell, where it continues to affect neighboring cells. How or why this reduces obsessions and compulsions is still unknown.        The best dose of anti-OCD medication should be determined on an individual, case-by-case basis. It is always best to use the smallest amount of medicine that effectively treats the child's OCD.  Most children metabolize medications quite rapidly, and relieving the child's OCD symptoms often necessitates the use of higher, adult-sized doses.        Anti-OCD medications control symptoms, but do not ""cure"" the disorder. This means that the positive effects of an anti-OCD medication occur as long as the drug is being taken. That some symptoms often remain, but with lower severity.      When the child stops taking the anti-OCD medication, symptoms usually return. At this point, there is no known cure for OCD.              Each of the anti-OCD medications is also an antidepressant. With clomipramine (Anafranil ®), it was discovered that certain antidepressant medications  helped control OCD symptoms. Not all antidepressant medications have anti-OCD effects, only those that strongly affect serotonin.        Cognitive-behavioral therapy, if available, should  be considered in addition to medication. This type of therapy (see discussion later in this booklet) is a safe and effective treatment for OCD. Medication alone is usually not as effective, nor are the benefits as long-lasting as medication plus cognitive-behavior therapy. Sometimes, finding a behavior therapist who treats childhood OCD is challenging. For this reason, many children with OCD are treated solely with medications.        All anti-OCD medications work slowly. Medication is often considered when the child's OCD is severe. Both the child and family are in distress. These drugs are not ""quick fixes."" It takes two to three months to see improvement in the OCD!  Recent studies show that ongoing improvement of OCD continues between twelve weeks and one year after starting medication.        No two children respond to anti-OCD medication in  the same way. An occasional child will not respond to any medication. It is common for children to respond individually to each of the anti-OCD medications. Some work well for a particular child, and some not at all. The occurrence of side effects  varies greatly. It is impossible to pick which medication will work best for a particular child. It is important to understand that if the first medication does not improve OCD, another one should be tried. The child may need a trial of each of the seven available anti-OCD medications to find the one that works best. The drug clomipramine is likely to cause bothersome side effects. Physicians often reserve prescribing it until several of the other anti-OCD drugs have been tried and failed.      This is not a hard and fast rule. There are valid reasons why a doctor may choose to prescribe it first. An individual child's response to these medications, as well as the occurrence of side effects, varies greatly from drug to drug.              Not all the anti-OCD drugs have the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in children and adolescents. Presently, four anti-OCD medications have been approved by the FDA for use in children. They are clomipramine (Anafranil ®), fluoxetine (Prozac ®), fluvoxamine (Luvox ®) and sertraline (Zoloft ®). The FDA grants this approval when large studies have been completed using pediatric patients. These large studies are very expensive and difficult to accomplish. They have not been conducted with all the anti-OCD medications. Doctors still prescribe any of the seven available medications to children of any age they deem appropriate. Most physicians prefer to use medication the FDA has specifically approved for use in children.      Let's take a closer look at each of the anti-OCD medications. Because each drug has two names, the first listed is the chemical name; the second, in (parentheses) is the brand name. Common pronunciation is in [brackets]. Each drug's customary dosing range for childhood OCD follows the drug names.    Clomipramine   Clomipramine [Clo-MIP'-raw-meen] — (Anafranil ®) [An-AF'-rah-nil] Customary dose range: 25 to 250 milligrams/day.     Clomipramine was the first anti-OCD medication to become widely available. It is the medication that has been most studied in children with OCD. Prior to its release in the United States, it was available for many years in Europe. It has the most long-term data of any of the drugs used to treat childhood OCD. Clomipramine affects the brain chemical serotonin. It also affects additional brain chemicals such as norepinephrine, histamine, acetylcholine, and dopamine. The effects on serotonin appear to be the most important in helping those with OCD. Clomipramine's effect on other brain chemicals may help to reduce OCD symptoms in particular children.    What Are Clomipramine'S Side Effects?   Clomipramine has a number of side effects, and most children will experience a few. The most common are sleepiness, dry mouth, or constipation. If children become excessively sleepy on clomipramine, the doctor will typically lower the dose. Often, the child's body adapts to this side effect and the sleepiness will lessen. Dry mouth can occur because clomipramine reduces the amount of saliva produced. A dry mouth is uncomfortable, but not medically dangerous. It, too, often diminishs in severity over time. If it doesn't, chewing sugarless gum to stimulate saliva production should make the child more comfortable. Dry mouth  becomes a problem if the child has orthodontic braces. The combination of reduced saliva production and braces leads to an increased rate of tooth decay. If clomipramine is started in a child with braces, the child's dentist should be informed. This is so they can watch more closely for tooth decay and try to prevent or correct it.    Parents can  prevent constipation from becoming a problem by being aware of the child's bowel habits. This is particularly true for younger children, who do not complain until several days have gone by without a bowel movement. A high-fiber diet, plenty of fluids, and regular exercise helps to prevent constipation. If constipation is a problem, parents should talk with the child's doctor. They may prescribe a stool-softening agent.    Clomipramine can cause irregular heartbeats, especially in children who have pre-existing heart abnormalities. Prior to starting a child on clomipramine, physicians should ask that the child have an electrocardiogram (ECG).  This is to ensure that the child's heart is beating normally. An ECG is a simple and painless test in which the heart's electrical activity is measured. The child's physician should order an ECG from time to time during clomipramine treatment. Especaily if a child is on a higher than usual dose, or if a child is experiencing heart-related side effects. The risk of clomipramine-related heart problems is very small, so most physicians believe that routinely obtaining ECGs is unnecessary.    Fluoxetine   Fluoxetine [Flu-OX-a-teen] — (Prozac ®) / PRO-zak]  Customary dose range: 5 to 60 milligrams/day.     Fluoxetine was the first selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SRIs) to be available in the United States. Drugs in this class of medications only affect the brain chemical serotonin. Although it is not specifically approved for use in treating childhood OCD, this drug is often prescribed to children with OCD. This is usually produces few side effects and many physicians are very comfortable prescribing it. It is also available in a liquid preparation. Sertraline has FDA approval for use in childhood OCD.    What Are Fluoxetine's Side Effects?   Most children take fluoxetine without experiencing any side effects. Occasionally, children develop an upset stomach, a rash, a headache, jitteriness, or insomnia. Fluoxetine can lead to changes in some children's behavior. Called behavioral side effects (BSEs),  are impulsive, silly, or defiant and aggressive behaviors (see description later in this guide). BSEs may be related to the dose of medication that the child is taking, as well as the child's age.    Fluvoxamine   Fluvoxamine [Flu-VOX-a-meen] — (Luvox ®) [LU-vox] Customary dose range: 25 to 250 milligrams/day.     Fluvoxamine is another of the selective SRI medications, similar to citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline. It acts specifically on serotonin, and has very limited effects on any of the other brain neurochemicals.    Fluvoxamine was the first selective SRI to receive FDA approval for use in children (down to age 8). This drug was available in Canada and Europe for many years prior to becoming available for use in the United States. Fluvoxamine has a long track record of safety for children.    What Are Fluvoxamine's Side Effects?   Most children can take fluvoxamine without  bothersome side effects. Still side effects can occur. The side effects reported in a recent study of childhood OCD include sleepiness insomnia, tremor, nervousness, and upset stomach. Fluvoxamine can lead to BSEs (see description later in this guide).    Sertraline   Sertraline [SIR-traw-leen]  — (Zoloft ®) [ZO-loft] Customary dose range: 50 to 150 milligrams/day.     Sertraline is also a selective SRI medication, similar in many ways to citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine. Sertraline acts specifically on serotonin, and has little if any effects on other brain chemicals. Sertraline has been used in studies specifically designed to research its safety and effectiveness in children with OCD. Sertraline has FDA approval for use in childhood OCD.    What Are Sertraline's Side Effects?   Most children take sertraline without experiencing side effects. However, side effects can occur. These are nervousness, upset stomach, or insomnia.    Fluvoxamine can lead to BSEs (see description later in this guide).    Paroxetine   Paroxetine [Paw-ROX-uh-teen] — (Paxil ®) [PACKS-il]  Customary dose range: 10 to 30 milligrams/day.     Paroxetine is another selective SRI medications, similar to citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline.    Paroxetine has been effective for OCD in adults, but it has not been systematically studied in children with the disorder.    What Are Paroxetine's Side Effects?   There is scant information about paroxetine's side effects in childhood OCD. In adults with OCD, paroxetine's side effects are similar to those of the other selective SRIs. This drug may be more likely to lead to dizziness and unsteadiness if the drug is abruptly stopped, which may be due to the drug's short half-life.    Citalopram   Citalopram [CIT-TAL-O-PRAM] — (Celexa ®) [CELL-X-A] Customary dose range: 20 to 60 milligrams/day.    Based on clinical research performed mainly in Europe, Celexa has proven to be useful for many psychiatric conditions. This includes depression (major depression, post-stroke dep, bipolar depression, etc), OCD, and panic disorder. In open label trials, Celexa showed promise in treating disorders such as social phobia, trichotillomania, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Many new research initiatives will occur. Celexa only has an FDA approved indication for depression. Celexa is available in liquid form.    Based on European and now US anecdotal responses and clinical trial information, Celexa is very well tolerated. Side effects of  nausea, dry mouth, somnolence, and ejaculatory delay are documented as commonly observed. The FDA determined definition of a commonly observed side effect is an incidence of greater than 5%. These side effects, from clinical experience, are normally mild and transient. They dissipate usually  after several weeks.    Drug Interactions: Due to low protein binding and minimal to no activity at the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system there is little potential for clinically significant drug interactions.    What Are Citalopram's Side Effects?   The most frequent side effects reported with Citalopram (Celexa) are nausea, dry mouth, drowsiness, insomnia, increased sweating, tremor, diarrhea and problems with ejaculation. People taking Citalopram (Celexa) generally do not suffer from insomnia, agitation, nervousness, or anxiety. There have been no reports of any significant change in weight when taking this drug.    There have been a few European studies of citalopram in pediatric/adolescent populations, that demonstrate effectiveness for obsessive-compulsive disorder.    Important Note: Forest Laboratories does not make any claims to the effectiveness or safety of using Celexa to treat OCD as this medication is not indicated by the FDA to treat any OCD condition.    Escitalopram   Escitalopram [EEE-CIT-TAL-O-PRAM] — (Lexapro ®) [LEX-A-PRO] Customary dose range: 10 to 20 milligrams/day.     Lexapro is the most recently developed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It is very closely related to Celexa, which is made up of a mixture of ""mirror image"" molecules. Lexapro consists of only one (the ""s"" form) of these Celexa molecules and has similar effectiveness and side effects. Lexapro has been found to be effective in social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and anxiety symptoms associated with major depression. No studies have been published on the use of Lexapro for obsessive-compulsive disorder, or on use in children.    What Are Escitalopram's Side Effects?   Side effects of Lexapro are similar to those reported for the other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (described above).    Is It Possible To Treat Childhood OCD Without Using Medication?   Sometimes. Drugs are not the only treatment for OCD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), has been shown to be effective. The cognitive-therapy component of CBT helps by challenging the catastrophic thinking and exaggerated sense of responsibility often seen in children with OCD.  A child may believe that taking his temperature many times per day prevents him and others from getting sick and dying. Cognitive therapy helps him to challenge the faulty assumptions behind this compulsion.    The behavioral component of CBT exposes the child to real-life things that  typically leads to a compulsive ritual.  A child who repeatedly takes his temperature would be encouraged to be around people he thinks are ill then the child is encouraged to refrain from taking his temperature. By being exposed to ""ill"" people, and not taking his temperature, the child learns from experience that the feared outcome of becoming sick and dying doesn't occur.    Children who don't respond adequately to cognitive-behavioral therapy alone, may find a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and medication helpful.    Are There Delayed Side Effects From Anti-OCD Medication?   Probably not, although no one knows for certain. There is no reason to expect long-term problems to develop. Most of these medications haven't been around long enough to answer this question with complete assurance. Clomipramine has been in use the longest (about 30 years). It has delayed side effects reported of gradual weight gain in some individuals. Fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been in widespread use for more than 10 years primarily in Europe and Canada. The delayed problems have not been reported. Sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram and escitalopram have not been available as long. The delayed side effects have not been reported with these medications either.    Which Anti-OCD Medication Should Be Tried First?   A child's response to each of the anti-OCD medications varies. Some children will respond to all of them, some will respond to only one, and some respond to none at all. Side effects vary from child to child, there is no ""best"" drug to start with. The decision of which drug to use first is made on a case-by-case basis. There are some considerations that guide physician decision-making regarding the selection of medication. These include:          Whether there was a positive response to a particular drug by other family members.        The presence of other problems besides OCD (i.e., clomipramine may help a child with insomnia get to sleep).        The potential for side effects (i.e., clomipramine's potential to cause constipation).        The physician's prior successes or experience with a particular drug.        Concerns about the child attempting suicide via an overdose.        The cost or availability of the drug (i.e., some health-care providers only allow their pharmacies to dispense a particular anti-OCD drug).        The FDA approval status of the drug (presently favors clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline)      What Should Be Done If The First Medication Tried Doesn't Seem To Work?   When this happens, several things should be considered:         Has enough time passed? All anti-OCD medications take time to work. If the child has been taking the medication less than 8 weeks, the best course may be simply to do nothing but wait until at least 12 weeks have passed that is assuming that the child has been taking an adequate dose.        Is the child actually taking the medication? A common saying among physicians is, ""Half of the patients take half of the medication, half of the time."" An anti-OCD medication will not work if it is not taken. This is a problem for adolescents who may be busy distracted, or ambivalent about taking medication.        Is the dose appropriate? The best dose of anti-OCD medication varies widely from child to child. If there has been no benefit and no side effects a dose increase may help. Childhood OCD uses the same doses of medication used to treat adult OCD. However, ""going low and slow"" in regard to drug treatment is always a prudent maxim to follow.        Is a cognitive-behavioral therapy program in place? A few children will feel better but continue to perform their OCD compulsions out of habit. It is as though they are better, but don't know it. The behavioral-therapy component of cognitive-behavioral therapy helps  the child experience the fact that they are better. It helps them to realize that they need not perform these rituals.      Sometimes, after all of the above considerations have been explored, the first medication chosen does not work. A trial of one of the other anti-OCD medications is often a reasonable choice.  This process may need to be repeated once or twice before a satisfactory anti-OCD response is achieved.    Is It Important To Obtain Blood Levels Of anti-OCD Drugs?   Sometimes blood levels are useful. Clomipramine is unique among anti-OCD medications in that excessively high blood levels can be medically dangerous. Due to the danger of seizures or heart problems, many physicians obtain blood levels to ensure that the dose being used is resulting in blood levels that fall within a safe range. This ensures a margin of safety for children taking higher than usual doses of this medication.    Blood levels of other anti-OCD medications are only used in special circumstances.  If there is a suspicion that a teenager is not taking the medication, obtaining a blood level of the drug definitively answers this question. Blood levels are helpful when drug combinations being used, have unusual side effects.    What If My Child Won't Swallow Pills?   One approach would be to use the liquid preparation of fluoxetine or citalopram. It is also possible to have the pharmacist compound fluvoxamine.    Liquids are dispensed in small amounts the child can tolerate. This avoids the discomfort of taking pills. An alternative approach would be to crush a tablet between two spoons, or pull apart and empty a gelatin capsule. They can  be added to a spoonful of apple sauce or jelly.    Can Very Young Children (Under The Age Of 6) Take These Medications?   It is difficult to make the diagnosis of OCD in very young children. Because of this medications are rarely considered for this age group. OCD can be diagnosed in a very young child, and medication may be recommended. There is little information in the medical literature regarding the use of anti-OCD medications in preschool children. It should only be considered in situations where the child is experiencing significant disability and/or distress. These situations, warrant a second medical opinion. This is often helpful.   What Are Behavioral Side Effects (BSEs)?   These side effects occur with any of the anti-OCD drugs. They are characterized by a significant change in the child's behavior. Some parents have described their child as being ""too happy"" or ""giddy."" Some have said their child became ""mouthy,"" impertinent, or provocative while taking an anti-OCD medication. Increased aggressiveness has been described. Some degree of BSE  probably occurs in 50 percent of children treated with anti-OCD medication. Most of the time, these side effects are mild and require no specific treatment. Occasionally they can be severe.    High anti-OCD medication doses or the age of the child may be contributing factors, so starting low and going slow when administering medication should always be a consideration.    If a marked behavioral change occurs that seems ""out of character,"" BSEs should be considered. When treating BSEs, reducing the dose is usually the first step. If that is not helpful, switching to an alternative medication is another option. There is probably an increased likelihood that the new drug will cause BSEs. Sometimes, adding a medication to control the BSEs (such as lithium) may be the best alternative. This is only done if the OCD symptoms are much improved by the anti-OCD drug.    Will My Child Have To Take These Medications Forever?   Perhaps OCD is a chronic condition and anti-OCD medications do not typically ""cure"" it the child. They may need to take medication indefinitely. This is because when medication is withdrawn, the OCD symptoms usually return to their pre-drug level of severity.    Many physicians advocate that anti-OCD treatment should continue for at least one year.  After a year of treatment, often during summer vacation or at another time the dose of the drug can be slowly lowered to see if it is still being helpful. If OCD symptoms return, the dose is raised again. Lowering the dose on a yearly basis benefits the child in several ways:          Assures the doctor, child, and parents that the drug is still needed.        Adjusts the dose of medication to the lowest effective level.        Prevents needless medication taking (occasionally OCD does go away).        Allows the child the opportunity to see if cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques (without medication) will be effective if OCD symptoms recur.        Minimizes the child's exposure to anti-OCD drugs.      The anti-OCD Drug Has Helped A Little, but My Child Still Has OCD Symptoms. What Should Be Done?   Perhaps nothing. These medications can take up to 12 weeks to become effective, and waiting is the best option. It is important to understand that these medications do not completely eliminate OCD symptoms. They reduce them to a manageable level.  These residual OCD symptoms are effectively controlled with cognitive-behavior therapy.    Do The SSRIS Have Withdrawal Effects?   On rare occasions, yes. Withdrawal adverse effects have been reported with nearly all the anti-OCD drugs. Especially when they are abruptly discontinued. This side effect seems to occur most often with paroxetine, the anti-OCD drug with the shortest half-life. Withdrawal symptoms are dizziness or unsteadiness, although unusual neurological symptoms have been reported on rare occasions.    Fluoxetine is the only SRI that has not been linked to adverse withdrawal effects. This is because this drug's long half-life makes it self-tapering. Even if the drug is stopped abruptly, the blood levels fall gradually over weeks to months.    Are These Drugs Dangerous In Overdose?   Yes, although clomipramine is the most dangerous. Any medication overdose should be viewed as a medical emergency. The child should be taken to an emergency room without delay. With proper treatment, complete recovery is the rule, although clomipramine overdoses can result in seizures, cardiac arrest, and even death. To avoid overdose, medications should always be kept safely out of the reach of small children, and an adult should always supervise the medication taken  by a child.    Combining Other Drugs With SRIS Prescription Drug   As many as 40 to 60 percent of those treated with one anti-OCD drug will have residual symptoms. In some instances, these remaining symptoms can be severe, despite trying several of the available medications along with cognitive-behavioral therapy. Drug combinations are sometimes tried called augmentation. The use of such medication combinations is only modestly researched in the treatment of adult OCD. There is essentially no research on this practice for the treatment of childhood OCD. When augmentation strategies are used in the treatment of childhood OCD, they are based primarily on the clinical experience of the child's doctor, and on applying to childhood OCD what is known about the treatment of treatment- resistant OCD in adults.    The use of medication augmentation is the exception rather than the rule. There are a number of circumstances in which this becomes a consideration. These include:          An unsatisfactory response to numerous single-drug treatments.        The presence of significant symptoms that are due to other disorder(s) in addition to OCD.        Treating the bothersome side effects from an anti-OCD medication While it is impossible to list all the possible medication combinations, a few of the more commonly used are listed below:                Adding clonazepam (Klonopin®) or buspirone (BuSpar®) to treat severe anxiety.            Adding methylphenidate (Ritalin®) to treat symptoms of ADHD.            Adding a major tranquilizer, such as Haloperidol (Haldol®), to treat tic symptoms, Tourette's syndrome, or psychosis.            Adding lithium carbonate to treat severe mood instability.            Combining clomipramine with an SRI to achieve a synergistic drug effect at lower than usual doses of each In addition to the drug augmentation strategies used to treat OCD, medication combinations are often necessary when treating additional illnesses children develop such as rashes, the flu, ear infections, etc.                  Combining anti-OCD medication with a drug used to treat a childhood illness is called adjunctive medication treatment. Sometimes these drugs can interact with anti-OCD drugs.    It is usually OK to treat children with OCD that have an occasional headache with acetaminophen (Tylenol®). Other medications may contain ingredients that interact adversely with anti-OCD drugs. A complete list of medications that can interact with anti-OCD medications is impossible to list in a pamphlet of this size. It is always best to consult with the doctor or pharmacist before combining medications. The following is a list of some of the common ingredients found in many medications that are known to interact with anti-OCD medications:          Caffeine (Interaction primarily with Fluvoxamine [Luvox®]: Probably OK with other anti-OCD medications), and can lead to sweating, nervousness, trembling, and insomnia.        Dextromethorphan: Can lead to extreme anxiety, chest, and abdominal discomfort.        Phenylpropanolamine: Can lead to extreme nervousness.      It is important to be aware that combining medications of any kind including over-the-counter ones can complicate the treatment of OCD.    If unanticipated side effects occur, it can be difficult to determine which of the medications is the culprit. All of the physicians involved in the health care of the child should be made aware of all the medications the child is taking. This includes psychiatric medications, but also asthma medications, antibiotics, over-the-counter cough medicines, anti-acne medications, and all others.    OCD symptoms are often a significant problem for children treated with single anti-OCD medications. Because the symptoms of comorbid psychiatric disorders or additional illnesses can be significant problems, drug combinations are sometimes required when treating children with OCD. The use of medication combinations is not well researched in children.  It is difficult to make specific recommendations on the use of medication combinations.  The decision to use them should be determined on a case-by-case basis in collaboration with a physician familiar with the treatment of childhood OCD.

Quitting smoking is one of the most difficult addiction-breaking processes that anyone can go through. Nicotine and tobacco are very addictive substances that can take months or even years to truly get out of a person's system. Even after quitting some smokers say they continue to have urges to start smoking again and many people do give in months after they have managed to quit. The most common method of to quit smoking is good old fashioned cold turkey. This is most often done by setting a date to quit, preparing oneself for that day and then using your brute willpower to overcome your desire to smoke.

Nicotine replacement therapies    Nicotine replacement therapies come in many different forms: skin patches, gum, sprays and inhalers. They have small amounts of nicotine in them and can help take the edge of cravings. These products work by slowly reducing the amount of nicotine delivered to your body to help you handle withdrawal symptoms more easily. Research shows these are effective in helping people to quit smoking, especially when combined with counselling or self-help.    More about  nicotine replacement therapies    Antidepressant drugs    Bupropion SR (Zyban) is a prescription antidepressant drug that can reduce the urge to smoke in some people. It's most effective in helping people quit when it's combined with other quit methods like counselling.    More about  medication to help you quit smoking    Unproven methods to quit smoking    Acupuncture and related therapies : Acupuncture is based on traditional Chinese healing. It uses needles to stimulate energy points in the body. Acupuncture is promoted as a way to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms in people who quit smoking. Some related therapies that have also been used as quit smoking aids are:        Acupressure     Electrostimulation     Laser therapy       There is not enough evidence to recommend these therapies to quit smoking 2 . More studies are needed before we can say if acupunture or related treatments help people quit smoking. 3 . It's best to check with your doctor before spending money on these therapies.      Hypnosis : Hypnosis or hypnotherapy is often promoted as a way to help people stop smoking. There are different types of hypnotherapies - some are meant to lessen the desire to smoke and others aim to increase the will to quit.    There is no evidence to show that hypnotherapy works as a treatment for helping people quit smoking 4 .         Nicotine withdrawal      Withdrawal is your body's response to being without the drug nicotine. Everyone who quits smoking should expect some withdrawal symptoms.       Common withdrawal symptoms:        Craving for a cigarette     Feeling tired     Cough     Gas/stomach pain     Hunger     Headache     Feeling irritable (bad mood)     Trouble concentrating       Symptoms of withdrawal and how long they last are different for everyone. In general, symptoms begin within hours of stopping smoking and can be worse in the evening. Symptoms tend to decrease over the first 4-5 days. Some people have stronger symptoms than others.    Withdrawal symptoms & remedies              Signs & symptoms      Causes      How long it lasts      What you can do              Irritability  (bad mood)      Body's craving for nicotine      2-4 weeks      Walks, hot baths, relaxation techniques e.g. soft music, stretching              Feeling tired, lack of energy      Nicotine is a stimulant - it keeps your brain active. It can take a couple of weeks for your body to learn to live without the boost from nicotine.      2-4 weeks      Take a nap if you're tired Don't push yourself              Trouble sleeping      Nicotine affects brain waves and sleep patterns      1 week      Avoid caffeine (e.g. coffee or sodas)              Cough Dry throat Nasal drip  (mucus slides down back of the throat)      Your body is getting rid of the mucus that has been trapped in your air ways      A few days      Drink lots of water or juice              Feeling dizzy      Your body is getting more oxygen      1 or 2 days      When you've been sitting in a chair or lying down, get up slowly              Trouble concentrating      Your body needs time to get used to being without the constant stimulation (boost) from nicotine      A few weeks      Reduce your workload and take lots of breaks              Tightness in chest      May be caused by sore muscles form coughing or tense muscles from nicotine cravings      A few weeks      Deep breathing              Gas Stomach pain Constipation      Bowel (intestinal) movement drops briefly             Drink lots of water and eat high-fibre foods e.g. fruits and vegetables              Hunger      You can confuse craving for cigarettes with hunger Your mouth is getting used to having nothing to do      2-4 weeks      Drink water and eat low calorie snacks: raw veggies, pretzels, popcorn, fruit              Craving for a cigarette      Withdrawal from the highly addictive drug, nicotine      Cravings occur most often in the first few days; some people have cravings occasionally for months or years      Wait out urges - they tend to last only a few minutes. Try another activity - have a drink of water, take a walk, call a friend or use a nicotine replacement product (e.g. gum)           Coping with cravings: the 4-D Solution    When you have the urge to smoke try the 4-D Solution:    1.  Drink water    Drink lots of water. This flushes the nicotine and other chemicals out of your system faster. It can help to keep your mouth busy.    2.  Deep breaths    Take a deep breath break instead of a smoke break. Take a few deep breaths. Hold the last one. Breathe out slowly.    3.  Delay    As a smoker you were not always in control. You smoked when your body wanted nicotine. By delaying or holding off, you are calling the shots. Often the craving for a cigarette can pass in a few minutes.    4.  Do something different    When a craving hits, it helps to get out of your current situation. Change what you're doing. Step outside. Call a friend. Read a book. Do something different. Some people find it helpful to do something with their hands when a craving strikes like squeezing a stress ball or knitting.     Quitting checklist        Pick a quit date and mark it on your calendar or post it on your fridge.    Write your personal reasons for quitting on a card. Carry that card with you and look at it when you are feeling unsure about your decision to quit or have the urge to smoke.     Before you quit record the time, location and your feelings (bored, stressed, angry) for each cigarette you smoke. Try and do this for a couple of days. Look at your smoking patterns and plan how you will handle everyday situations in which you normally smoke.     Make smoking less comfortable and easy: Switch hands when you smoke, carry cigarettes in a different place, switch to a brand you don't like, don't carry a lighter or matches.     Find things to replace your most important cigarettes. For example, if you always smoke first thing in the morning try chewing a piece of nicotine gum or go for a walk instead.     Make an appointment to have your teeth cleaned on quit day. The fresh taste in your mouth and whiter teeth will help keep you motivated.     Remind yourself that quitting is a process. You had to learn to smoke. You need to take the time to learn how not to smoke.            References :    1.  Fiore MC, Bailey WC, Cohen SJ, et al. Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence.

The vast majority of smokers quit without external assistance. Research from the United States has estimated that more than 90% of successful quitters do so unassisted, and that those who quit unassisted are twice as likely to succeed as those who attend a quit program (although this is likely to reflect the fact that those who attend special programs are more likely to be heavily addicted). Stopping 'cold turkey' (that is, stopping smoking completely) appears to be a more successful strategy than attempting to quit by reducing consumption gradually or switching to lower tar cigarettes. The desire to quit                                                                                                                                              might be triggered by a wide range of influences or events, such as a cough or other unpleasant symptoms due to smoking, advice from a health worker or family and friends, or adverse publicity about smoking. Smokers may find 'self-help' guides with brief instructions or advice about how to stop, and lifestyle advice useful. Provision of this information is a cost effective way to help motivated smokers quit. Indicators for success with quitting smoking are: being highly motivated and expecting to succeed, having a supportive environment, and having the skills to cope with adaptation and change. Many smokers try several times before successful quitting. This does not have to be viewed negatively: smokers may learn from relapse and be successful next time.                                              Role of cessation clinics                      Some smokers find attending a quit course helpful. These courses generally provide trained counsellors who assist intending quitters with skills to help them quit successfully. They may provide further information about smoking, teach relaxation techniques, provide advice about diet, exercise and managing withdrawal symptoms in an atmosphere of group support. Cessation clinics are sometimes criticised because of the expense taken to run them, compared with their overall impact on reducing national smoking rates. It is argued that if the money spent on running quit clinics were instead put into public education campaigns, a far higher impact would be made on the smoking rates of the community; and that as the majority of smokers are able to quit unassisted by professional guidance, a finite proportion of funding should be allocated to assist those who cannot. Proponents of this view recommend that existing contact with health professionals should be maximised to provide personal and expert help to smokers.                      Cessation clinics are more likely to be used by those having special difficulty in quitting, particularly heavy, more addicted smokers, and there is counter argument that they serve a limited but nonetheless important role by providing intensive cessation programs for those who need them most. However a fault of the programs may be that they are inaccessible to high risk target groups (for example to the poor, the less educated, or high risk subgroups in the population such as pregnant women).                                               Nicotine replacement therapies                      Nicotine replacement therapies (NRT), whether provided through oral gum or via skin patch, are intended to aid heavily dependent smokers in quitting smoking. NRT provides a replacement dose of nicotine, helping to ease nicotine withdrawal symptoms such as craving and mood changes when the smoker stops smoking. However they do not offer a 'magic bullet'. As with all smoking cessation programs, most quitters will take more than one attempt to quit successfully. Nicotine polacrilex ('chewing gum'): The nicotine released from the gum is intended to prevent the onset of nicotine withdrawal symptoms, allowing the patient to concentrate on breaking the psychological aspects of the smoking habit. Through a successive reduction in consumption of the tablets, the patient is then taken off the nicotine. Highly nicotine dependent patients benefit most from nicotine gum replacement therapy. The benefits are not clear for those who are less dependent, so gum is not recommended for this subgroup unless other cessation methods fail. Gum use may cause a sore throat or mouth, tired jaws, hiccups, nausea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, palpitations, and rarely, mouth ulcers. Some of these symptoms are relieved by encouraging slower chewing and having rest periods, allowing maximal absorption of nicotine through the lining of the mouth (and for less to be swallowed). Research has shown that consuming acidic foods or drinks prior to using gum can impair nicotine absorption, so as a general rule, gum use should be delayed at least 15 minutes after eating or drinking.                      Transdermal nicotine (nicotine 'patches') : Adhesive nicotine patches provide replacement nicotine from a reservoir for absorption through the skin. As with nicotine chewing gum, the patches are intended to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms while the smoker becomes accustomed to no longer smoking. Patches may be more effective than gum in that patient compliance is likely to be higher because they are simpler to use; further, since they provide a steady level of nicotine, the risk of long term use caused by the reinforcing effects of receiving a bolus of nicotine when craving starts is avoided. In general, rate of success increases with intensity of behavioural intervention (through physician's advice, provision of educational information, counselling, follow-up and so on). Highly dependent smokers are more likely to succeed with quitting if dosages of NRT are extended and modified to suit their requirements, and if behavioural intervention is included in their treatment.                       Nicotine aerosols : Nicotine aerosols for administration orally, nasally or by inhalation, are currently undergoing clinical testing and are not yet commercially available. The aerosols produce rapid increases in blood-nicotine level, which may make them more effective for heavily addicted smokers, or in combination with other nicotine replacement or other therapies. Although there has been concern that they may cause too great an elevation in blood-nicotine levels and local irritation, recent research on the effectiveness of nasal nicotine spray is encouraging.                       Roll-on tobacco products : Tobacco extract in roll-on form is available over the counter in some states. It differs from the transdermal nicotine patches in that it contains full tobacco extract, rather than nicotine alone. Success of these products has not been supported by any appropriately controlled studies. Further, topical carcinogenicity of tobacco is well established (for example oral carcinomas in those who chew tobacco) so use of tobacco extract on the skin cannot be regarded as safe. Nicotine is not carcinogenic in its own right, and is the only useful constituent of tobacco derived smoking cessation products.                                               Nicotine blockade                      Blockade therapy aims to reduce the rewarding effects gained through cigarette use. Drugs are used to block the nicotine receptors in the central nervous system, so that smoking delivers no pharmacological benefit to the smoker. One such drug is mecamylamine, but it is unlikely to develop as a viable cessation aid as it has major incapacitating side effects, and does not alleviate the behavioural aspects of smoking.                                              Aversion therapy                      There are a number of methods for inducing aversion to smoking, the aim of which is to reduce the incentive to smoke. These include associating smoking with unpleasant imagery (covert sensitisation), with discomfort caused through electric shock or other stimuli, or with the unpleasant effects produced by smoking itself (directed smoking procedures). Strategies used to induce aversion include satiation smoking in which the smoker dramatically increases consumption prior to quitting; rapid smoking in which the smoker inhales frequently and consistently until reaching the point of nausea; and variations on smoking technique designed to engender distaste, displeasure or disgust ('reduced aversion' techniques). Rapid smoking should not be practised by those with a history of cardiovascular disease or other risk factors. Aversion therapy has shown mixed success. Satiation smoking does not appear to be successful, but rapid smoking is effective at least in the short term, especially if combined with appropriate counselling. Reduced aversion techniques produce effects similar to rapid smoking. Shock treatments have not been shown to be successful.                                              Acupuncture                      Acupuncturists commonly treat smoking by applying needles or surgical staples to the surface of the nose, the ears or the wrist. Acupuncture is intended to provide relief from withdrawal symptoms, rather than to cure the addiction itself, and is more effective when combined with appropriate counselling.                                              Hypnosis                      As with acupuncture, the success of hypnosis has been poorly evaluated. It appears, however, that when used in isolation, hypnosis does not produce high rates of success. Rates rise if hypnosis is used in conjunction with counselling and follow-up support, and if the quitter is highly motivated and expects to succeed. Hypnosis generally involves giving smokers direct suggestions to change and suggesting alternative behaviours, fostering an aversion to smoking, and teaching self-hypnosis and relaxation techniques.                                                                                                                                        More information on quitting smoking   How to quit smoking?  - Many smokers know they need to quid smoking to avoid health risk. Smoking cessation is of the most importance for people who is suffering from unpleasant smoking symptoms.   What health effects are associated with smoking?  - The main health risks in tobacco smoking pertain to diseases of the respiratory tract and also to diseases of the cardiovascular system, in particular smoking being a major risk factor for a myocardial infarction (heart attack).    What're the constituents of tobacco smoke?  - Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of several thousand chemical compounds. These include particulates (tar) of sticky solids, gases such as carbon monoxide, and volatiles. Most importantly, the smoke contains nicotine  the addictive drug.   Smoking and lung cancer  - Lung cancer is directly related to smoking. Over 40 carcinogens have been identified in cigarette smoke. The risk of developing lung cancer is directly related to the number of cigarettes smoked.    Smoking and cardiovascular disease  - There are a number of cardiovascular diseases that can be related to smoking. They include heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Smoking aggravates and accelerates of the development of atherosclerotic lesions in the arterial walls.   Smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease in which the lung is damaged, making it hard to breathe. Prolonged tobacco use causes lung inflammation and variable degrees of air sack (alveoli) destruction.   Other cancers caused by or associated with smoking  - Cigarette smoking is a major cause of cancers of the oral cavity, oesophagus and larynx. Smoking is a cause of bladder cancer. Cigarette smoking is at least a contributory and may be a causal factor in the development of pancreatic cancer.    Women's health and smoking  - Women smokers suffer all the consequences of smoking that men do such as increased of risk various cancers (lung, mouth, larynx, pharynx, esophagus, kidney, pancreas, kidney, and bladder) and respiratory diseases.   Harm to human body by smoking  - Chemicals in tobacco cause damage to the macula (the most sensitive part of the retina, the back of the eye). Smoking is a risk factor for all cancers associated with the larynx, oral cavity and oesophagus.   What is passive smoking?  - ""Passive smoking"" or ""secondhand smoke"" - also known as ""environmental tobacco smoke"" (ETS) or ""involuntary smoking"" - occurs when the ambient smoke from one person's cigarette is inhaled by other people.   Health hazards of passive smoking  - Some of the immediate effects of passive smoking include eye irritation, headache, cough, sore throat, dizziness and nausea. Adults with asthma can experience a significant decline in lung function when exposed, while new cases of asthma may be induced in children whose parents smoke.   How to avoid passive smoking?  - Let your visitors know your home is a smoke-free zone, request them to smoke outside. Ask your visitors to put off the cigarette before entering your room. Ask to be seated in non-smoking areas as far from smokers as possible when dining out.   What is a smoking addiction?  - A smoking addiction means a person has formed an uncontrollable dependence on cigarettes to the point where stopping smoking would cause severe emotional, mental, or physical reactions.    Why quit smoking?  - Smoking increases the risk of respiratory diseases such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Smokers have twice the risk of dying of heart attacks, as do non-smokers.   How to stop smoking?  - Quitting smoking is a lot like losing weight; it takes a strong commitment over a long period of time. Withdrawal from nicotine has two parts - the physical and the psychological.   Cigar smoking and health  - A cigar is defined, for tax purposes, as ""any roll of tobacco wrapped in leaf tobacco or in any substance containing tobacco,"" while a cigarette is ""any roll of tobacco wrapped in paper or any substance not containing tobacco.   What smoking cessation medications are available?  - Nicotine for NRT is available by prescription as an inhaler or nasal spray (Nicotrol Inhaler and Nicotrol NS).    Changes in body weight and smoking cessation  - Smokers weigh, on average, around 3 kg less than non-smokers, although heavy smokers are more likely to be moderately or severely overweight. For many people, the fear of gaining weight prevents them from quitting smoking.   Health benefits of quitting smoking  - Smoking cessation has major and immediate health benefits for men and women of all ages. The health benefits of smoking cessation far exceed any risks from the average 2.3 kg (5 pound) weight gain or any adverse psychological effects that may follow quitting.

The US Surgeon General has said, ""Smoking cessation [stopping smoking] represents the single most important step that smokers can take to enhance the length and quality of their lives.""    Quitting smoking is not easy, but you can do it. To have the best chance of success in quitting, you need to know what you’re up against, what your options are, and where to go for help. You'll find this information here.    Why is it so hard to quit smoking?    Mark Twain said, ""Quitting smoking is easy. I've done it a thousand times."" Maybe you've tried to quit, too. Why is quitting and staying quit hard for so many people? The answer is nicotine.    Nicotine    Nicotine is a drug found naturally in tobacco. It is highly addictive -- as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Over time, a person becomes physically and emotionally addicted to (dependent on) nicotine. Studies have shown that smokers must deal with both the physical and psychological (mental) dependence to quit and stay quit.    How nicotine gets in, where it goes, and how long it stays    When you inhale smoke, nicotine is carried deep into your lungs. There it is absorbed quickly into the bloodstream and carried throughout your body. Nicotine affects many parts of the body, including your heart and blood vessels, your hormones, your metabolism, and your brain. Nicotine can be found in breast milk and even in mucus from the cervix of a female smoker. During pregnancy, nicotine freely crosses the placenta and has been found in amniotic fluid and the umbilical cord blood of newborn infants.    Several different factors can affect how long it takes the body to remove nicotine and its by-products. In most cases, regular smokers will still have nicotine or its by-products, such as cotinine, in their bodies for about 3 to 4 days after stopping.    How nicotine hooks smokers    Nicotine produces pleasant feelings that make the smoker want to smoke more. It also acts as a kind of depressant by interfering with the flow of information between nerve cells. As the nervous system adapts to nicotine, smokers tend to increase the number of cigarettes they smoke. This, in turn, increases the amount of nicotine in the smoker's blood. After a while, the smoker develops a tolerance to the drug. Tolerance means that it takes more nicotine to get the same effect that the smoker used to get from smaller amounts. This leads to an increase in smoking over time. The smoker reaches a certain nicotine level and then keeps smoking to maintain this level of nicotine. In fact, nicotine inhaled in cigarette smoke reaches the brain faster than drugs that enter the body intravenously (IV).    Nicotine withdrawal symptoms can lead quitters back to smoking    When smokers try to cut back or quit, the lack of nicotine leads to withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal is both physical and mental. Physically, the body reacts to the absence of nicotine. Mentally, the smoker is faced with giving up a habit, which calls for a major change in behavior. The physical and mental both must be addressed for the quitting process to work.    Those who have smoked regularly for a few weeks or longer, and suddenly stop using tobacco or greatly reduce the amount smoked, will have withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms usually start within a few hours of the last cigarette and peak about 2 to 3 days later when most of the nicotine and its by-products are out of the body. Withdrawal symptoms can last for a few days to up to several weeks.    Withdrawal symptoms can include any of the following:        dizziness (which may only last 1 to 2 days after quitting)      depression      feelings of frustration, impatience, and anger      anxiety      irritability      sleep disturbances, including having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, and having bad dreams or even nightmares      trouble concentrating      restlessness      headaches      tiredness      increased appetite      These symptoms can lead the smoker to start smoking cigarettes again to boost blood levels of nicotine back to a level where there are no symptoms. (For information on coping with withdrawal, see the section, "" How to quit ."")    Smoking also makes your body get rid of certain drugs faster than usual. When you quit smoking, it changes the way your body handles some medicines. Ask your doctor if any medicines you take regularly need to be checked or changed after you quit.    Why should I quit?    Your health    Health concerns usually top the list of reasons people give for quitting smoking. This is a very real concern: About half of all smokers who keep smoking will end up dying from a smoking-related illness.    Cancer    Nearly everyone knows that smoking can cause lung cancer, but few people realize it is also a risk factor for many other kinds of cancer too, including cancer of the mouth, voice box (larynx), throat (pharynx), esophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, cervix, stomach, and some leukemias.    Lung diseases    Pneumonia has been included in the list of diseases known to be caused by smoking since 2004. Smoking also increases your risk of getting lung diseases like emphysema and chronic bronchitis. These diseases are grouped together under the term COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD causes chronic illness and disability, and worsens over time -- sometimes becoming fatal. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis can be found in people as young as 40, but are usually found later in life, when the symptoms get much worse. Long-term smokers have the highest risk of developing severe COPD.    Heart attacks, strokes, and blood vessel diseases    Smokers are twice as likely to die from heart attacks as are non-smokers. And smoking is a major risk factor for peripheral vascular disease, a narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood to the leg and arm muscles. Smoking also affects the walls of the vessels that carry blood to the brain (carotid arteries), which can cause strokes. Men who smoke are more likely to develop erectile dysfunction (impotence) because of blood vessel disease.    Blindness and other problems    Smoking causes an increased risk of macular degeneration, one of the most common causes of blindness in older people. It also causes premature wrinkling of the skin, bad breath, bad-smelling clothes and hair, yellow fingernails.    Special risks to women and babies    Women have some unique risks linked to smoking. Women over 35 who smoke and use birth control pills have a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and blood clots of the legs. Women who smoke are more likely to miscarry (lose the baby) or have a lower birth-weight baby. And low birth-weight babies are more likely to die, or have learning and physical problems.    Years of life lost due to smoking    Based on data collected in the late 1990s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that adult male smokers lost an average of 13.2 years of life and female smokers lost 14.5 years of life because of smoking. And given the diseases that smoking can cause, it can steal your quality of life long before you die. Smoking-related illness can limit your activities by making it harder to breathe, get around, work, or play.    Why quit now?    No matter how old you are or how long you've smoked, quitting can help you live longer and be healthier. People who stop smoking before age 50 cut their risk of dying in the next 15 years in half compared with those who keep smoking. Ex-smokers enjoy a higher quality of life with fewer illnesses from cold and flu viruses, better self-reported health, and reduced rates of bronchitis and pneumonia.    For decades the Surgeon General has reported the health risks linked to smoking. In 1990, the Surgeon General concluded:        Quitting smoking has major and immediate health benefits for men and women of all ages. These benefits apply to people who already have smoking-related disease and those who don't.          Ex-smokers live longer than people who keep smoking.          Quitting smoking lowers the risk of lung cancer, other cancers, heart attack, stroke, and chronic lung disease.          Women who stop smoking before pregnancy or during the first 3 to 4 months of pregnancy reduce their risk of having a low birth-weight baby to that of women who never smoked.          The health benefits of quitting smoking are far greater than any risks from the small weight gain (usually less than 10 pounds) or any emotional or psychological problems that may follow quitting.      When smokers quit -- What are the benefits over time?    20 minutes after quitting:  Your heart rate and blood pressure drops.    (Effect of Smoking on Arterial Stiffness and Pulse Pressure Amplification, Mahmud, A, Feely, J. 2003.  Hypertension :41:183.)     12 hours after quitting:  The carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal.    ( US Surgeon General's Report , 1988, p. 202)     2 weeks to 3 months after quitting:  Your circulation improves and your lung function increases.     ( US Surgeon General's Report , 1990, pp.193, 194,196, 285, 323)     1 to 9 months after quitting:  Coughing and shortness of breath decrease; cilia (tiny hair-like structures that move mucus out of the lungs) regain normal function in the lungs, increasing the ability to handle mucus, clean the lungs, and reduce the risk of infection.     ( US Surgeon General's Report , 1990, pp. 285-287, 304)     1 year after quitting:  The excess risk of coronary heart disease is half that of a smoker's.    ( US Surgeon General's Report , 1990, p. vi)     5 years after quitting:  Your stroke risk is reduced to that of a non-smoker 5 to 15 years after quitting.    ( US Surgeon General's Report , 1990, p. vi)     10 years after quitting:  The lung cancer death rate is about half that of a continuing smoker's. The risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, cervix, and pancreas decrease, too.    ( US Surgeon General's Report , 1990, pp. vi, 131, 148, 152, 155, 164,166)     15 years after quitting:  The risk of coronary heart disease is the same as a non-smoker's.    ( US Surgeon General's Report , 1990, p. vi)     Immediate rewards of quitting    Kicking the tobacco habit offers some benefits that you'll notice right away and some that will develop over time. These rewards can improve your day-to-day life a great deal.        your breath smells better      stained teeth get whiter      bad smelling clothes and hair go away      your yellow fingers and fingernails disappear      food tastes better      your sense of smell returns to normal      everyday activities no longer leave you out of breath (such as climbing stairs or light housework)      Cost    The prospect of better health is a major reason for quitting, but there are other reasons, too.    Smoking is expensive. It isn't hard to figure out how much you spend on smoking: multiply how much money you spend on tobacco every day by 365 (days per year). The amount may surprise you. Now multiply that by the number of years you have been using tobacco and that amount will probably shock you.    Multiply the cost per year by 10 (for the next 10 years) and ask yourself what you would rather do with that much money.    And this doesn't include other possible costs, such as higher costs for health and life insurance, and likely health care costs due to tobacco-related problems.    Social acceptance    Smoking is less socially acceptable now than it was in the past.    Almost all workplaces now have some type of smoking rules. Some employers even prefer to hire non-smokers. Studies show smoking employees cost businesses more because they are out sick more. Employees who are ill more often than others can raise an employer's need for expensive short-term replacement workers. They can increase insurance costs both for other employees and for the employer, who often pays part of the workers’ insurance premiums. Smokers in a building also can increase the maintenance costs of keeping odors down, since residue from cigarette smoke clings to carpets, drapes, and other fabrics.    Landlords may choose not to rent to smokers since maintenance costs and insurance rates may rise when smokers live in buildings.    Friends may ask you not to smoke in their homes or cars. Public buildings, concerts, and even sporting events are largely smoke-free. And more and more communities are restricting smoking in all public places, including restaurants and bars. Like it or not, finding a place to smoke can be a hassle.    Smokers may also find their prospects for dating or romantic involvement, including marriage, are largely limited to other smokers, who make up less than 20% of the adult population.    Health of others    Smoking not only harms your health but it hurts the health of those around you. Exposure to secondhand smoke (also called environmental tobacco smoke or passive smoking) includes exhaled smoke as well as smoke from burning cigarettes.    Studies have shown that secondhand smoke causes thousands of deaths each year from lung cancer and heart disease in healthy non-smokers.    If a mother smokes, there is a higher risk of her baby developing asthma in childhood, especially if she smoked while she was pregnant. Smoking is also linked to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and low-birth weight infants. Babies and children raised in a household where there is smoking have more ear infections, colds, bronchitis, and other lung and breathing problems than children from non-smoking families. Secondhand smoke can also cause eye irritation, headaches, nausea, and dizziness.    Setting an example    If you have children, you probably want to set a good example for them. When asked, nearly all smokers say they don't want their children to smoke, but children whose parents smoke are more likely to start smoking themselves. You can become a good role model for them by quitting now.    Help is available    With the wide range of counseling services, self-help materials, and medicines available today, smokers have more tools than ever to help them quit smoking for good.    Remember, tobacco addiction is both mental and physical. For most people, the best way to quit will be some combination of medicine, a method to change personal habits, and emotional support. The following sections describe these tools and how they may be helpful to you.    Help with the mental part of addiction    Some people are able to quit on their own, without the help of others or the use of medicines. But for many smokers, it can be hard to break the social and emotional ties to smoking while getting over nicotine withdrawal symptoms at the same time. Fortunately, there are many sources of support out there -- both formal and informal.    Telephone-based help to stop smoking    As of 2008, all states run some type of free telephone-based program, such as the American Cancer Society's Quitline ®  tobacco cessation program that links callers with trained counselors. These specialists help plan a quit method that fits each person's unique smoking pattern. People who use telephone counseling are twice as likely to stop smoking as those who don't get this type of help. Help from a counselor can help quitters can avoid many common mistakes.    Telephone counseling is also easier to use than some other support programs. It doesn't require driving, transportation, or child care, and it's available nights and weekends.    Counselors may suggest a combination of methods including medicines, local classes, self-help brochures, and/or a network of family and friends.    Call us to get help finding a Quitline ®  or other phone counseling program in your area.    Support of family, friends, and quit programs    Many former smokers say a support network of family and friends was very important during their quit attempt. Other people who may offer support and encouragement are co-workers and your family doctor. Choose to spend time with non-smokers and ex-smokers who support your efforts to quit.    Members of support groups for quitters can be helpful to you as well. Nicotine Anonymous, for instance, is an open support group that offers a way to find others who are quitting tobacco. It also offers a long-term approach to quitting. (See the "" Additional resources "" section for contact information.) But it is only one of many types of support groups. You can check with your employer, health insurance company, or local hospital to find support groups. Or call the ACS at  1-800-ACS-2345  ( 1-800-227-2345 ).    What to look for in a stop smoking program    Stop smoking programs are designed to help smokers recognize and cope with problems that come up during quitting. They also provide support and encouragement in staying quit. Studies have shown that the best programs will include either one-on-one or group counseling. There is a strong link between how often and how long counseling lasts (its intensity) and the success rate. In general, the more intense the program, the greater the chance of success.    For example, intensity may be increased by having more or longer sessions or by increasing the number of weeks over which the sessions are given. So, when looking for programs, try and find one that has the following:        each session lasts at least 20 to 30 minutes      there are at least 4 to 7 sessions      the program lasts at least 2 weeks -- longer is usually better      Make sure the leader of the group has training in smoking cessation.    Some communities have a Nicotine Anonymous group that holds regular meetings. This group applies the 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) to the addiction of smoking. This may include admitting you are powerless over your addiction to nicotine and having a sponsor to talk with when you are tempted to smoke. These meetings are free, though most will take donations if you like.    Often your local American Cancer Society, American Lung Association, or your local health department will sponsor quit smoking classes. Call us for more information.    There are some programs to watch out for as well. Not all programs are ethical. Think twice about any programs that do the following:        promise instant, easy success with no effort on your part      use injections or pills, especially ""secret"" ingredients      charge a very high fee -- check with the Better Business Bureau if you have doubts      are not willing to give you references from people who have used the program      Help with the physical part of addiction: Nicotine replacement therapy and other medicines    Nicotine replacement therapy    As mentioned earlier, the nicotine in cigarettes leads to actual physical dependence. This can cause unpleasant symptoms when a person tries to quit. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) gives you nicotine -- in the form of gums, patches, sprays, inhalers, or lozenges -- but not the other harmful chemicals in tobacco. It can help relieve some of these symptoms so that you can focus on the psychological (emotional) aspects of quitting.    How nicotine replacement works    Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can help with the difficult withdrawal symptoms and cravings that 70% to 90% of smokers say is their only reason for not giving up cigarettes. Using NRT reduces a smoker's withdrawal symptoms.    Although many smokers can quit smoking without using NRT, most of those who attempt quitting cannot do it on the first try. In fact, smokers usually need many tries -- sometimes as many as 8 to 10 -- before they are able to quit for good.    Lack of success is often related to the onset of withdrawal symptoms. And most quitters go back to smoking within the first 3 months of quitting. So don't be discouraged if you start smoking again. Just try to stop again and make your attempt more successful by adding another method or technique to help you quit. You can reduce withdrawal symptoms with NRT and reduce their impact with support techniques. This gives you a better chance of quitting and staying quit.    Getting the most from nicotine replacement    Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) only deals with the physical addiction. It is not meant to be the only method used to help you quit smoking. You should combine it with other smoking cessation methods that help the psychological (emotional and habitual) part of smoking, such as a stop smoking program. Studies have shown that this approach -- pairing NRT with a program that helps to change behavior -- can double your chances of quitting and staying quit.    The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Clinical Practice Guideline on Smoking Cessation in 2000 recommended NRT for all adult smokers except pregnant women and people with heart or circulatory diseases. But more recent data suggest that NRT (specifically the nicotine patch) can be used safely under a doctor's careful monitoring, even in people who have heart or blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. These studies have found the benefits of quitting smoking outweigh the risks of NRT in patients with cardiovascular disease. When looking at these situations, the benefits of quitting smoking must outweigh the potential health risks of NRT for each person. As of late 2008, there is still not enough good evidence one way or the other to recommend using NRT in pregnant women. Pregnant smokers should talk with their doctors before using over-the-counter nicotine replacements.    The best time to start NRT is when you first quit. Many smokers ask if it is possible to start a program of nicotine replacement while they are still smoking. At this time the companies that make NRT products say that they should not be used if you are still smoking. There is some research being done with smokers using NRT while still smoking, but it is still too early to tell if this is dangerous to your health. The most important thing is to make sure that you are not overdosing on nicotine, which can affect your heart and blood circulation. It is safest to be under a doctor's care if you wish to try smoking and using NRT while you are tapering down your cigarette use.    Often smokers first try to quit on their own then decide to try NRT a day or more into quitting. This method does not give you the greatest chance of success, but do not let this discourage you. There are still many options available for quitting smoking and staying quit.    Note that NRT has not yet been proven to help people who smoke less than 10 cigarettes per day. You may want to talk with your doctor about a lower dose of NRT if you smoke less than half a pack per day but feel you need nicotine replacement.    When may I begin using nicotine replacement therapy?    You may start using NRT as soon as you throw away that last cigarette. You do not need to wait a certain length of time to put on the patch or start using the gum, lozenge, nasal spray, or inhaler. You should double-check this information with the instructions on your chosen method of nicotine replacement, but in general there is no need to wait to start using NRT.    How do I know if I'm a light, average, or heavy smoker?    Some NRT products make their recommendations based on what kind of smoker you are. But there is no formal category in any textbook or group that defines a light, average, or heavy smoker. In general, a light smoker is someone who smokes less than 10 cigarettes per day. Someone who smokes a pack a day or more is a heavy smoker. An average smoker falls in between.    Sometimes a doctor will use the term  pack year  to describe how long and how much a person has smoked. A pack year is defined as the number of packs of cigarettes a person has smoked every day multiplied by the number of years he or she has smoked. Since 1 pack is 20 cigarettes, a person who has smoked 20 cigarettes a day for a year is considered to have smoked 1 pack year. Someone who has smoked 30 cigarettes a day (1½ packs) for 3 years has smoked 4.5 pack years (1½ x 3), and so on. This is just another way to figure out how high your risk of smoking-related disease might be.    Types of nicotine replacement therapy    The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 5 types of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT):    Nicotine patches (transdermal nicotine systems):  Patches give a measured dose of nicotine through the skin. You are weaned off nicotine by switching to lower-dose patches over a course of weeks. Patches can be bought with or without a prescription. Many types and different strengths are available. Package inserts describe how to use the product, and list special considerations and possible side effects.    The 16-hour patch works well if you are a light-to-average smoker. It is less likely to cause side effects like skin irritation, racing heartbeat, sleep problems, and headache. But it does not deliver nicotine during the night, so it may not be right for those with early morning withdrawal symptoms.    The 24-hour patch provides a steady dose of nicotine, avoiding peaks and valleys. It helps with early morning withdrawal. But there may be more side effects such as disrupted sleep patterns and skin irritation.    Depending on body size, most smokers should start using a full-strength patch (15-22 mg of nicotine) daily for 4 weeks, and then use a weaker patch (5-14 mg of nicotine) for another 4 weeks. The patch should be put on in the morning on a clean, dry area of the skin without much hair. It should be placed below the neck and above the waist -- for example, on the upper arm or chest. The FDA recommends using the patch for a total of 3 to 5 months.    Side effects are related to:        the dose of nicotine      the brand of patch      skin characteristics (such as the person's tendency to have a skin reaction to the patch)      how long the patch is used      how it is applied      Some possible side effects of the nicotine patch include:        skin irritation -- redness and itching      dizziness      racing heartbeat      sleep problems or unusual dreams      headache      nausea      vomiting      muscle aches and stiffness      What to do about side effects:        Do not smoke while you are using a patch.            Try a different brand of patch if your skin becomes irritated.            Reduce the amount of nicotine by using a lower-dose patch.            Sleep problems may be short-term and go away in 3 or 4 days. If not, and you're using a 24-hour patch, try switching to a 16-hour patch.          Stop using the patch and try a different form of NRT.        Nicotine gum (nicotine polacrilex):  Nicotine gum is a fast-acting form of replacement in which nicotine is taken in through the mucous membrane of the mouth. You can buy it over the counter without a prescription. It comes in 2 mg and 4 mg strengths.    For best results, follow the instructions on the package insert. Chew the gum slowly until you note a peppery taste. Then ""park"" it inside your cheek, chewing it and parking it off and on for about 20 to 30 minutes. Food and drink can affect how well the nicotine is absorbed. You should avoid acidic foods and drinks such as coffee, juices, and soft drinks for at least 15 minutes before and during gum use.    If you smoke a pack or more per day, smoke within 30 minutes of waking up, or have trouble not smoking in restricted areas, you may need to start with the higher dose (4 mg). Chew no more than 20 pieces of gum in one day. Nicotine gum is usually recommended for 1 to 3 months, with the maximum being 6 months. Tapering the amount of gum chewed may help you stop using it.    If you have sensitive skin, you may prefer the gum to the patch.    Another advantage of nicotine gum is that it allows you to control the nicotine doses. The gum can be chewed as needed or on a fixed schedule during the day. The most recent research has shown that scheduled dosing works better. A schedule of 1 to 2 pieces per hour is common. On the other hand, with an as-needed schedule, you can chew when you need it most -- when you have cravings.    Some possible side effects of nicotine gum:        bad taste        throat irritation        mouth sores        hiccups        nausea        jaw discomfort        racing heartbeat      Symptoms related to the stomach and jaw are usually caused by improper use of the gum, such as swallowing the nicotine or chewing too fast. The gum can also damage dentures and dental work.    Long-term dependence is one possible disadvantage of nicotine gum. In fact, research has shown that 15% to 20% of gum users who are able to quit smoking keep using the gum for a year or longer. Although the maximum recommended length of use is 6 months, continuing to use the gum is probably safer than going back to smoking. But since there is little research on the health effects of long-term nicotine gum use, most health care providers still recommend limiting its use to 6 months.    Nicotine nasal spray:  The nasal spray delivers nicotine to the bloodstream as it is quickly absorbed through the nose. It is available only by prescription.    The nasal spray relieves withdrawal symptoms very quickly and lets you control your nicotine cravings. Smokers usually like the nasal spray because it is easy to use. But the FDA warns users that since this product contains nicotine, it can allow the addiction to continue. The FDA recommends that the spray be prescribed for 3-month periods and that it not be used for longer than 6 months.    The most common side effects last about 1 to 2 weeks and can include the following:        nasal irritation        runny nose        watery eyes        sneezing        throat irritation        coughing      There is also the danger of using more than is needed. If you have asthma, allergies, nasal polyps, or sinus problems, your doctor may suggest another form of NRT.    Nicotine inhalers:  Inhalers are available only by prescription. The nicotine inhaler is a thin plastic tube with a nicotine cartridge inside. When you take a puff from the inhaler, the cartridge puts out a nicotine vapor. Unlike other inhalers, which deliver most of the medicine to the lungs, the nicotine inhaler delivers most of the nicotine vapor to the mouth. Nicotine inhalers are the closest thing to smoking a cigarette, which some smokers find helpful.    The recommended dose is between 6 and 16 cartridges a day, for up to 6 months.    The most common side effects, especially when first using the inhaler, include:        coughing        throat irritation        upset stomach      At this time, inhalers are the most expensive forms of NRT available.    Nicotine lozenges:  Nicotine-containing lozenges as an over-the-counter aid to stop smoking are the newest form of NRT on the market. As with nicotine gum, the Commit ®  lozenge is available in 2 strengths: 2 mg and 4 mg. Smokers choose their dose based on how long after waking up they normally have their first cigarette.    The lozenge manufacturer recommends using it as part of a 12-week program. The recommended dose is 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours for 6 weeks, then 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours for weeks 7 to 9, and finally, 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours for weeks 10 to 12. The manufacturer also recommends the following:        Stop all smoking when you begin to use the lozenge.            Do not eat or drink for 15 minutes before using the lozenge. (Some drinks can reduce how well the lozenge works.)            Suck on the lozenge until it is fully dissolved, about 20 to 30 minutes. Do not bite or chew it like a hard candy, and do not swallow it. The medicine is taken in through the tissues of the mouth.            Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours, or more than 20 lozenges total per day.            Stop using the lozenge after 12 weeks. If you still feel you need to use the lozenge, talk to your doctor.          Do not use the lozenge if you keep smoking, chewing tobacco, using snuff, or use any other product containing nicotine (such as the nicotine patch or nicotine gum).        Possible side effects of the nicotine lozenge include:        trouble sleeping        nausea        hiccups        coughing        heartburn        headache        flatulence (gas)        Which type of nicotine replacement may be right for you?    There's no evidence that any one type of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is any better than another. When choosing which type of NRT you will use, think about which method will best fit your lifestyle and pattern of smoking. Do you want/need something to chew or occupy your hands? Or are you looking for once-a-day convenience?    Some important points to think about:        Nicotine gums, lozenges, and inhalers are substitutes you can put into your mouth that allow you to control your dosage to help keep cravings under better control.            Nicotine gums and lozenges are generally sugar-free, but if you are diabetic and have any doubts, check with the manufacturer.            Nicotine nasal spray works very quickly when you need it.          Nicotine inhalers allow you to mimic the use of cigarettes by puffing and holding the inhaler.          Nicotine patches are convenient and only have to be applied once a day.            Both inhalers and nasal sprays require a doctor’s prescription.            Some people may not be able to use patches, inhalers, or nasal sprays because of allergies or other conditions.        Whatever type you use, take your NRT at the recommended dose, and for as long as it is recommended. If you use a different dose or stop taking it too soon, it can't be expected to work like it should. If you are a very heavy smoker or a very light smoker, you may want to talk with your doctor about whether your NRT dose should be changed to better suit your situation.    Combining the patch and other nicotine replacement products:  Using the nicotine patch along with shorter-acting products such as the gum, lozenge, nasal spray, or inhaler is another method of NRT. The idea is to get a steady dose of nicotine with the patch and to use one of the shorter-acting products when you have strong cravings.    The few studies that have been done on combination NRT used in the way described above have found that it may work better than a single product. Still, more research is needed to prove this and to find safe and effective doses. The combined use of NRT products has not yet been approved by the FDA. If you are thinking about using more than one NRT product, be sure to talk it over with your doctor first.    High-dose nicotine replacement therapy for heavy smokers:  Another NRT option is to give smokers a higher dose based on the amount of nicotine that they have been getting from cigarettes. Sometimes this method has required larger doses of nicotine replacement than have been used before. High-dose NRT with patches has been studied with patients getting from 35 mg to 63 mg of nicotine per day. The research suggests that patients' withdrawal symptoms go away with these higher doses and their cravings improve without harmful effects on the heart and circulation. Patient were carefully watched in these studies to make sure they were doing well and were not becoming ill or having any problems. This is still a new option that should be considered only with a doctor's guidance and supervision.    Stopping nicotine replacement therapy    As mentioned before, most forms of NRT are meant to be used for limited periods of time. Use should be tapered down to a low dose before NRT is stopped. Research is still being done to refine the use of NRT. For example, even though the patch is usually used for 3 to 5 months, some studies have suggested that using it for 8 weeks or less works just as well. But other researchers have noted that the risk of relapse goes up when nicotine replacement is stopped, even after it has been used for 5 months. These differences have not been fully explained. More studies are needed to learn which smokers are likely to be successful using shorter or longer NRT than usual. If you feel that you need NRT for a different length of time than is recommended, it is best to discuss this with your doctor.    Bupropion (Zyban ® )    Bupropion (Zyban ® ) is a prescription anti-depressant in an extended-release form that reduces symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. It does not contain nicotine. This drug acts on chemicals in the brain that are related to nicotine craving. It can be used alone or together with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Bupropion works best if it is started 1 or 2 weeks before you quit smoking. The usual dosage is one or two 150 mg tablets per day.    This drug should not be taken if you have ever had seizures, heavy alcohol use, serious head injury, bipolar (manic-depressive) illness, or anorexia or bulimia (eating disorders).    Some doctors may recommend combination therapy for heavily-addicted smokers, such as using bupropion along with a nicotine patch and/or a short-acting form of NRT (such as gum or lozenges). The combination has been found to work better in some people than using any one part alone.    Varenicline (Chantix™)    Varenicline (Chantix™) is a newer prescription medicine developed to help people stop smoking. It works by interfering with nicotine receptors in the brain. This means it has 2 effects: it lessens the pleasurable physical effects a person gets from smoking, and it reduces the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.    Several studies have shown varenicline can more than double the chances of quitting smoking. Some studies have also found it may work better than bupropion, at least in the short term.    Varenicline comes in pill form and is taken after meals, with a full glass of water. The daily dose increases over the first 8 days it is taken. The dose starts at one 0.5 mg pill a day for the first 3 days, then the 0.5 mg pill twice a day for the next 4 days. At the start of the second week, the dose is raised to 1 mg each morning and evening. For people who have problems with the higher dose, a lower dose may be used during the quit effort. Varenicline is given for 12 weeks, but people who quit during that time may get another 12 weeks of treatment to boost their chance of staying quit.    Reported side effects of varenicline have included headaches, nausea, vomiting, trouble sleeping, unusual dreams, flatulence (gas), and changes in taste. There have also been more recent reports of depressed mood, thoughts of suicide, attempted suicide, and changes in behavior in people taking varenicline. People who have these problems should contact their doctors right away. Although these side effects may happen, varenicline is usually well-tolerated.    Since varenicline is a newer drug, research has not been done to find out if it is safe to use along with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products. But the company that makes varenicline noted that people who used the drug along with NRT had more side effects such as nausea and headaches.    Other drugs that are not FDA-approved for helping smokers quit    For those who cannot use any of the FDA-approved drugs for helping smokers quit, or for those who have not been able to quit using them, there are other drugs that have shown promise in research studies. They are recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for this kind of use, but have not been approved by the FDA for this purpose and are used ""off-label."" (See our document  Off Label Drug Use  for more information.) These drugs are only available with a prescription and are not recommended for pregnant smokers, teens, or people who smoke less than 10 cigarettes per day.    Nortriptyline    This is an older anti-depressant drug. When used in groups of smokers, it has been found to double their chances of success in quitting smoking. It is started 10 to 28 days before you stop smoking to allow it to reach a stable level in the body.    Some people have side effects such as fast heart rate, blurred vision, trouble urinating, dry mouth, constipation, weight gain or loss, and low blood pressure when they stand up. The drug can impair your ability to drive or operate machinery, and there are certain drugs that cannot be used along with it.    Be sure your doctor and pharmacist know exactly what you are taking before you start this medicine. Also be sure you know how to take it and how to taper it down when you are ready to stop. The dose of nortriptyline must be gradually lowered, since the drug cannot be stopped suddenly without the possibility of serious effects. The drug must be used with caution in people with heart disease.    Clonidine    Clonidine is also an older drug that is FDA approved for the treatment of high blood pressure. When used for smoking cessation, it can be given as a pill twice a day or as a once-a-week skin patch. In one study of heavy smokers who had failed in previous quit attempts, the group treated with clonidine was twice as likely to succeed in quitting smoking as the control group (which was given a fake pill) at the end of 4 weeks.    Be sure your doctor and pharmacist know exactly what you are taking before you start this medicine. The most common side effects of clonidine are constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, and unusual tiredness or weakness. There are rarely more severe side effects, such as allergic reactions, slow heart rate, and very high or very low blood pressure. Your doctor may want to watch your blood pressure while you are on this drug. The drug can impair your ability to drive or operate machinery    Clonidine can be started up to 3 days before you quit smoking but can also be started the day you quit. Like nortriptyline, it shouldn't be stopped suddenly. The dose must be lowered over a period of 2 to 4 days to prevent a rapid increase in blood pressure, agitation, confusion, or tremors.    Other methods of quitting    Other tools may also help some people, although there is no strong evidence they can improve your chances of quitting.    Hypnosis    Hypnosis methods vary a great deal, which makes it hard to study as a way to stop smoking. For the most part, reviews that looked at studies of hypnosis to help people quit smoking have not supported it as a quitting method that works. Still, some people find it useful. If you are interested in trying it, ask your doctor if he or she can recommend a good hypnotherapist.    Acupuncture    This method has been used to quit smoking, but there is little evidence to show that it works. Acupuncture for smoking is usually done on certain parts of the ears. Although there is a very weak suggestion that acupuncture might lower the desire to smoke, there still is no solid evidence that it is truly effective as a smoking cessation tool.

RJR makes cigarettes             - and lots of them - and has done so for many years. Ol' Richard Joshua             Reynolds himself built half the town it seems over one hundred years             ago. Because Mr. Reynolds added a bunch to the top line of the local             economy, he was well-liked. When he died, I suspect the city mourned             the death of the cigarette magnate, who most certainly smoked cigarettes             himself, for some time. Even today, local tour guides defend RJR by             specifically noting that he died of pancreatic  cancer,             not lung cancer. This point becomes a bit less defendable, though, when             you understand that cigarette smoking increases the risk of pancreatic             cancer many-fold. And as far as all the other bad things that cigarettes             do to your body, that's just the tip of the iceberg.            Most people associate cigarette smoking with either             nothing bad at  all or with lung cancer. In fact,             a recent article in a leading medical journal that showed that most             smokers don't even think they're at increased risk for heart disease.             But they are. And smoking also causes esophageal cancer, bladder cancer,             and stomach cancer, not to mention emphysema. I've discussed cancers             elsewhere, so emphysema deserves special note here. This is a disease             characterized by difficulty breathing, which, by the way, is not a lot             of fun. To try it, jump in a lake and breathe several times underwater.             What you will experience is similar to that which you will observe in             particular patients in a hospital pulmonary ward. I would argue that             fewer people would smoke if they visited with emphysema patients. Gasping             for breath and drowning in your own secretions is not a pretty sight.            The smoking habits of a patient, past or present, are             an important part of the  patient history .             To flush out smokers who think that they don't smoke enough to qualify             as smokers, doctors will usually ask questions such as, ""How many packs             of cigarettes do you smoke a day?"", rather than, ""Do you  smoke?""             In many cases, though, I already knew that a patient smoked. How? Smokers             smell awful. Ever wonder why there are smoking and non-smoking rooms             in hotels? Here's a hint: rooms where people have smoked smell awful.             If preventing stroke, heart disease, and cancers along with the fact             that you smell like sin when you smoke doesn't convince you to quit,             then consider the fact that the FDA has now classified second hand smoke             (what your friends, colleagues, loved ones, and total strangers are             breathing around you) as a known carcinogen. This means that you are             causing cancer in other people, too. Sounds pretty selfish, doesn't             it? So have some respect for others, even if you don't care about yourself.             Personally, I think smoking in public should be illegal, just as spraying             Agent Orange in public should be illegal.            Over the last few years, there have been considerable             efforts on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry to develop a stop-smoking             therapeutic. First, there was the nicotine patch, which was nicely followed             up with nicotine  gum. Then there was Zyban, a pill             solution to smoking. Zyban is an interesting drug, sort of like  Flexeril ,             in that it is (surprise) an anti-depressant, formerly known as Wellbutrin.             Many years ago, when people were taking Wellbutrin because they were             depressed, somebody figured out that a lot of depressed patients taking             Wellbutrin stopped smoking. So this means that if you are depressed             and want to stop smoking, Zyban might help. Whether you are depressed             or not, Zyban or nicotine or some other therapeutic may assist you in             your quest to stop smoking. A pre-requisite, however, is the desire             to quit. Unless you have decided that you are going to quit no matter             what, Zyban or other things likely won't do diddley. If you have made             the firm decision to quit, tell your doctor, but don't just tell him             that you want Zyban.            I knew a cardiologist who asked every             patient he met - smokers and non-smokers alike - how he or she stopped             smoking. Although some patients who have never smoked are somewhat offended             when you ask them how they stopped something they never started, I loved             the idea, so I started asking also. For me, at least, the overwhelming             result from former smokers was cold-turkey. A lot of people also said             that they did it in groups - with their husbands, friends, and co-workers.             In almost each case, the patient began with, ""I decided that I was going             to quit, and  If you smoke, the decision to quit is the first step             to impressing your doctor with a healthier lifestyle. The same might             be said for exercising or losing weight. As my crew coach said, ""The             hardest part of running is lacing up your shoes."" Or as my childhood             minister said, ""Once you've begun, you're half-way there."" So maybe             deciding to quit is not exactly the hardest part of quitting, but most             physicians rightly consider such a decision an important factor in quitting.                                                                                                                                                                       NICOTINE             FIX             It should            be no surprise by now that nicotine is an addictive drug. Nicotine has            central nervous system (brain, spinal cord) effects, peripheral vascular            effects, and many other adverse reactions in diverse parts of the body.            The addiction to nicotine is occasionally mitigated by the use of decreasing            levels of externally supplied nicotine, as in patches and nasal sprays            (shown above). However, without a strong desire to quit, most anti-smoking            measures are useless.                                                                                                                                                                        NOT             A SMOKER            Examination            of a smoker's mouth reveals a characteristic smell as well as darkened            teeth. Within the aerodigestive tract, smoking allows certain bacteria            to proliferate, which increases the smoker's susceptibility to infections            such as pneumonia. There is also evidence that the bacteria able to            proliferate in smokers' lungs generate carcinogenic materials. Further,            smoking increases release of free radicals, which are reactive compounds            that can mutate DNA. Mutated DNA spells cancer, which is much, much            more common throughout the aerodigestive tract of smokers than in non-smokers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Cigarettes are bad actors, and they cause your physician             to develop gray hair. The pathology of cigarettes extends well beyond             lung cancer, which kills more people than any other cancer. Bladder,             esophageal, pancreatic, and stomach cancers are also caused by smoking.             Emphysema is a horrible disease that almost all chronic smokers develop.             Quitting smoking begins with definitely deciding to quit. Your doctor             may be able to help. There are few things, other than quitting smoking,             that you could do for yourself that would make your doctor happier.                                                                                              What You Say                                                       What Your Doctor is Thinking                                             I just can't quit smoking right now. There           are too many things going on.           I must convince him that he needs to decide           to quit. We've got to decrease his heart disease risk.                           Smoking helps me deal with stress.           With cancer in the family, he's at risk. What is wrong           with his life? How can we reduce stress in other ways (working less, improving           friendship structures)? Then we can discuss deciding to quit.                          If I don't smoke, I eat all the time.          What techniques can I employ to encourage adopting a           healthier dietary lifestyle (exercising, better diet)? Her mother had           a stroke years ago. Smoking could enhance the risk of this patient stroking.                                     I just feel more comfortable in social situations when           I'm smoking.           Wow, she smells awful.                                                                                                                         1.  Ask yourself if you are           really ready to quit. Don't try to quit without first making this decision.          2.  Once you have decided to quit, your doctor can           help. She should be very happy to help you quit smoking for a large number           of reasons, including the fact that her life will be easier.          3.  Working on other aspects of a healthy life,           such as a healthier diet and stress reduction, could increase your chances           of quitting smoking.          4.  If you don't smoke, avoid smoke-filled areas          - second hand smoke is a known carcinogen.                           ____________________                                Is your doctor's attitude toward            smoking acceptable?

I had done it dozens of times--sometimes for six weeks at a time... The hard part was not starting up again, especially during times of stress or at parties, etc.       So, when I got serious about quitting (because I had small children and wanted them NEVER to start smoking), some friends and I formed a Stop Smokling Group. No, not the usual kind that never works, wher one person gets or loses a lot of money. In our group the deal was this: you pledged to all members of the group that 1) on your honor for the rest of your life you would not ingest ANY tobaccinous product and 2) if you did so, you would immediately turn over $100 in cash to every other member of the group. So, when any of us felt like taking that FIRST puff again after quitting, we knew it was immediately going to set us back $1,000 in cash. Twenty-five years later, some of us are perhaps a little disappointed that no one has caved in to the desire to smoke again: we could have used the money. And an unexpected but kinda nice side benefit is that we have discovered 10 other people whose word is their bond. How many of you know ten others persons you can trust?   -- Anonymous, July 23, 2000     I heard a psychiatrist once say that smokers often did so to repel other people, whether its annoying husbands or whatever.  --  Sam Bell , March 29, 2001   I tried to quit at least 8x's or more- but now that I am close to 50 yrs old I figure it is my last change- God Willing, I hope it was not too late.  I am able to do things I had difficulity doing before, ex. Walking up stairs, house hold chores without geting out of breath.  Fast pace walks, I would like to be able to run but I do have some difficulity with that.  I did gain 10 lbs, I figure I can work on that later and it is better than looking slim in the coffin!  I think volunteer work at a hospital w/smoking related ill patients would not only help oneself but also help the sick patients &  bring some pleasure and company to their day.   Are there any local hosp.in N. Andover, MA 01845 area?  -- Cynthia Doherty/72 Fernview/N.Andover, M, July 11, 2001   The little bit that I read on smoking isn't what I was looking for.  Eveything that was in the article I had already known.  The cure for quiting was always associated with a doctor.  Can't you have any advice on quiting and not going to a doctor.  Going to a doctor is just another way for them to get money and it really doesn't work.  Once you get on the medicine it might work but then you either become addicted to the meds or you stop taking them and decide to smoke again.  -- Anonymous, August 10, 2001   I quit cold turkey.  It was hell, but after a year I don't have cravings anymore.  Sure, for FOOD...but I'm sure I'm a lot healthier with the extra 20 lbs. than still smoking.  I used an artificial plastic cigarette made by a company named EZ-Quit.  I found it on Quitnet.com, a GREAT support site.  I used scare sites on the Web to remind myself of all the ugly, nasty diseases smoking causes.  I chew a lot of gum and drink a lot of jasmine tea.  After a year, I have finally weaned myself off the cheese crackers and onto salads, but I still eat a lot.  I do feel better though and have saved a lot of money.  Best advice I can give is get the artificial cigarette and keep looking at those scare sites on the Web.    -- Teresa, March 26, 2002   can it make ur eyes yellow?     --  Christina , April 5, 2002   I want to know the influence which smoking may have on nutritional status?  --  dietetic student , April 30, 2002   I'm at the doorway of stop smoking, its bad for my heart (having a heart condition), don't want to take the patch, want to do it cold turkey, but don't know if i can.

The thought of cigarettes controlling my life, made me quit, cold turkey, and it worked.  I am almost a year without them, but know it's the last time I'm putting myself through this...I know one thing from having quit one time before, that I cannot take one single puff from anyone elses smokes, or I am totally hooked again...think twice before that first puff...good luck, you can do it.....  -- Mari, August 23, 2002     I smoked through most of my twenties and quit cold turkey about three years ago.  I still want a cigarette when I see others smoking. Cold turkey is the only way to quit -- taking psych meds to turn your brain inside out is absolutely horrifying -- and prolonging the moment with gum and patches just means you haven't made the decision to quit yet.  Still the way I phrased it to myself was: I am not going to smoke right now.  If I want to again some day, I will.  So it was just a matter of making that time between cigarettes last a long, long, LONG time. I think this was easier for my id to handle and lessened the sense of loss one gets when trying to ditch aspects of one's behavior.  --  Jennifer , September 21, 2002     I think you should try too put in your mind that you could get cancer, heart disease and increases injury rates!!!!  --  fatima , November 5, 2002   I quit cold turkey for about the 5th time and am now a non-smoker of eight weeks.

I tried zyban, and would like to try it again. Insanely, here's my excuse.   I ""quit"" the first time I tried zyban. Happy in my success (three months nicotine free), when my insurance company instituted a program where nonsmokers save $30 a month in premiums, I signed the little card saying I was a nonsmoker. Somewhere along the line, I picked up that first one, again.   If I go back to my doctor to get zyban, it's listed on my medical records and my insurance company discovers I've picked up the habit again. They have made it clear they will back-bill the reductions. I'm up to 1/2 a pack..and the will to quit is strong. Cold turkey seems impossible. I hate the habit, I hate feeling like a slave to nicotine, and mostly, I hate knowing I'm putting my life at risk with every inhale. I hate the thought that I may not live to see my grandchildren, and I hate that every time I cough I'm aware that I move closer to a 'smokers cough.' I've been smoking since I was 16--that's 17 years now. And I'm tired of paying out all this cash.

This drasticly increases its effectiveness.  Also, ask your Dr to prescribe it as Welbutrin and not Zyban.

The problem is ""the crutch"" we who have smoked for a long time have come to depend on a cigarette to lessen the stress, grief, tension or any factor in our environment that we evaluate as ""uncomfortable"" Yes it's a known fact that cigarettes do have a sedative affect - if that were the only problem then obviously a valium would satisfy that particular emotion. It's way beyond that mindset. Some will say ""all you did was trade one bad habit for another"" YES that is exactly what I did because of being geared into a frame of mind that a cigarette helps me deal with life in general (a must have) EXCEPT I haven't had a cigarette in a long, long time - my brain doesn't know the difference but my lungs sure do! by the way the gum also has nicotine,  but it isn't a good enough crutch to get past it!   -- Anonymous, June 16, 2003   At the age of 50 after 25years of smoking, I decided to quit cold turkey.  I always used the excuse that cigarettes were my friends in time of need. I am divorced and they were always there for me. It was a time filler and an excuse to take breaks @ work, etc. After my daughter trying for years to convince me to quit, I realized that it was something I had to do for me. I could lie to her and sneak them--we don't live in the same house. But it was something I wanted to do for me after all these years. It has only been a week but I feel like I have started down a road and I don't want to look back.  I am already breathing better, have more energy, and alot more time that I have spent lighting up. I am drinking alot of water, and instead of walking I intend to start jogging for exercise.  I have alot of nervous energy now and I need to keep busy. I did try a puff after the first day and it tasted terrible! No I didn't get past the first puff as it totally trashed my mouth and I couldn't wait to brush my mouth and tongue. I believe now how many changes take place the first 24 hours without a cig. Guess what, they are all for the good!   Great website!  My daughter sent it to me.

Like most of us I tryed quitting smoking a couple of tmes without success. I smoked for 24 yrs and being 38yrs old knowing this, Im thinking my life will be short. With a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, strokes etc. I knew that I might be in trouble. This time last year, I decided to see my doctor (who I may add was very supportive)on my decision. I started on the program involving welbutrin. I set my quit date 14 days prior in starting the medication. On the 14th day I stopped smoking all together. The purpose of welbutrin is to help decrease the  symptoms you have with nicotine withdraw. With the support of my friends, family  and of course my doctor,I fill very successful in having determination/desire to quit. Do it for yourself. No one else can do it for you. My year will be 3/23/04 smoke-free. I thank god everyday. I want to wish everybody success on stop smoking that reads this story. JUST TAKE IT ONE DAY AT A TIME. You are worth it.  -- Kathy, March 10, 2004   i have made the commitment to quit smoking as of jan.2,04. the reason for this message is the government is planning on raising taxes on cigarettes if this is so why won't the government try and do something to help these people to quit. why? because the government would go broke if everyone in the u.s. would quit smoking for a year. so the subject matter is the government is advertising for people to smoke on one hand and quit on the other.there will always be smugglers to bring in cigarettes from other countries as long as people can get cigarettes they will smoke anyway.i have seen advertisement on one website saying to quit smoking and on the same page advertisement of how to get cheap cigarettes. what is the reasoning in that.the taxes in the united states are causing the people to go broke and some to get paid higher salaries for our misfortunes.         thank you   -- Anonymous, March 13, 2004   I came on your site for me. At 17 I smoke. That's it. After reading this page, and the stories i'm off it. i know myself that since i finished school i have been both drinking and smoking alot. I have noticed alot of laziness as i used to be fitter and love my exercise. Since smoking i get bad habits of eating fatty foods and junk. What really makes me upset is that mum smokes and i can hear her always coughing heaps in the bathroom ( i mean a severe flem cough). IT makes me feel heaps bad because i know even if she stops now, (as she always says she will) the damage cannot be rapaired. So guys, thats it, im off it now and back into fitness. Its good, the education we can get these days to teach us how bad it is. For kids doing assignments on the site, its not cool, its stupid. Fitness and active, healthy living is what life is all about.  Thanks for the site guys, as the girls said 'u rock'....  -- Luke , March 16, 2004   I think i smoked cos I'm a bit suicidal so I don't really   care if I get to live longer when I quit, however I do   hate being dependent on something that's lining the   pockets of a bunch of fat cats, so I quit and spend the   money on me!  -- Anonymous, March 18, 2004   I quit using Zyban and gum and the usenet newsgroup alt.support.stop-smoking.

Cold turkey is usually best and off course is ultimately what happens. I found if I switched to nicotine substitute, gum, for a little while to get rid of the smoke effects your resolve and energy to then break away from nicotine is much higher. It may not be necessary to use nicotine replacement for a long while, it is important to get yourself on a good roll and let the energy of momentum carry you through. Everybody can quit smoking if you put in the effort to keep trying until it ""clicks"" for you. Once you get rolling it becomes a much better ride.  -- Glynn, March 3, 2005   my grandma smokes but she refuses to stor. so i am making a poster with pictures and prrsuading words. she means everything to me  -- ANONYMOUS , March 17, 2005   I have many quit smoking many times in my life.

My dad used to smoke too, and died of cancer age 43.  It was like all the people that had passed on, were saying ""you silly girl, get a grip!""  So the battle continues....  --   Celeste , April 11, 2005   I've just gone cold turkey,from smoking   about 20-40 a day.Been smoking for 15   years,I'm 30 now.I've also quit coffee and   lots of other junk food so that I can cleanse   my system completely.I'm doing a 7day   detox-no food just herbs(which really helps   the cravings too).  I recommend that you check out natural   medicine,eg. flower remedies and   essences,I'm taking them and have virtually   no cravings.Better to see a herbalist or a   kinesiologist for professional advice-DONT   make your own prescription,you need to be   tested by a professional!!!!  Prayer is essential-God made us,only HE   can heal us.  -- L,Ireland, April 26, 2005   I have just recently stopped smoking and I am 50 years old and have smoked  since the age of 19. Within the past five years I have been told that I have Fibromyalgia, TMJ, have pinched nerves,  depression, and chronic IBS.  My life was a never-ending nightmare.  I bounced from doctor to doctor,,,taking pill after pill and getting to the point that I wanted to die rather than live the way I was half-living.  I always knew that smoking was bad,,but the sicker I got the more I smoked until I got to a point that I was smoking more than a pack a day.  I wanted to quit so bad but I did not know how to begin.  I did not want to take more and more pills, so I sat down and made a list of all the reasons to quit and made a visual chart of the money it cost me to keep smoking.  I ended up with a really bad throat infection and my doctor told me I better put the cigarettes down...so I went home and threw them away along with all the ashtrays and anything to remind me of them...then I went to my knees and asked God to give me courage,,,nothing else, just courage.  I have been smoke free for 48 days now.  The third day I had quit, my headache(vascular migraine) that I had been living with for four years,,left me and I don't know where it went but good riddance.  My health has made a complete turn-a-round.  I have not been to a doctor or chiropractor since I quit and the only medication I take is a pill each day for spastic colon.  I am walking and working out and have only gained four pounds.  I have been told that I was allergic(I have chronic chemical allergies) to the nicotine and chemicals in the tobacco and I was very much on my way to having a stoke due to the lack of oxygen and blood flow to my brain.  With God's help I hope to never put a cigarette in my mouth ever again.  Anyone wanting to quit smoking needs to be sure they go to God first,,he will hold your hand the entire way.  --  Bernice Sullivan , April 29, 2005   i quit smoking the first time i saw   smokers lungs!

Quit smoking is the solution, when you feel that you want to quit ask for help you will find it, if not I would suggest you to send an email to yours cigarretes company and ask them to increase the prize of every cigarrette package at least 50 cents, so every time you buy one they can save those 50 cents to your future.

There, if u can get back with me with some imformation I will appreciate the concern.                                           Thank u!   --  native bronx , May 24, 2005   I stopped smoking exactly 2 weeks ago today.  I went to a doctor who performed auricular therapy on my ear and this was supposed to stop my cravings.  Well as far as I am concerned this does not help!  I did quit smoking anyway, but I have just as bad if not worse cravings after having the ear therapy done that I did all of those other times that I quit.  My wife quit with me, and that has made it so much easier, but I'll tell  you I am always tired now, and I think that has to do with the fact that I have not changed my diet from when I smoked yet.  I need to start eating breakfast.  Congrats to everyone who has made it, and everone who will make it!  I know it is hard, but we can all quit if we decide that it is time.  -- Jason, May 24, 2005   hello every one i quit a year ago. i took zyban and   also stepped up my liquor consumption which is   clearly stated on the bottle not to do ""i know it was   stupid"" anyway i went nuts and almost lost my   family. then i quit zyban and carried on drinking   but never smoked again.

I was told that i must stop smoking to be able to receive my medication.  I smoked about ten a day and had smoked about 20 years.  I said OK and did not question him and most of all for the sake of my two young kids I have no choice but to do it.  No second thoughts what so ever.      I asked to be seen by the practice nurse for support, and received patches not knowing that it can increase headaches and nightmares at the time, which I just don't need as I live with permenant headaches and have great difficulty settling down at night as it is.    So I did not use the patches and was given a perscription for Nicorette lozengers.  That was the 15th June 2005 and I have used 5 lozengers and I have not held or smoked a cigerette since the 14th June 2005 and it is all down to me wanting and needing to be here for MY CHILDREN.     I did stop about 15 years ago for 8 months but I was not a mother and a wife then, young free and single.  Then when on holiday in Greece I started again.    So being a mum makes me all the more determened now to be a non-smoker for the rest of my life.   May I add when I had the children I did not and ever did smoke in my house or near or over them, I just wish that I stopped before I even thought about becoming a mother and not put them through being a smoker the nine months I carried them both.     I found this website whilst looking at images of smokers lungs.  Believe me I was sickened and yes enough to keep me on the right track of non-smoking.   Thank you for letting me express the story of my journey as a non-smoker so far yes I have a long way to go but wish me luck x  x  x  x  -- Star, August 8, 2005   I started smoking at age 13. I am now 44.  I never wanted to be a smoker...I always thought is was just for fun and I would some day stop.  I have stopped for stretches of 6 months or even a year but would always start up again.  Stress or where alcohol might be involved and I really thought I could have just 'one'...I can't!!! I have now choose to quit for good.  Cold turkey 3 weeks ago.  I can't believe it but I really am just so sick of it I have no desire to smoke.  I have coughed so much in the last week my lungs could not even handle it.  I didn't cough much before so I guess my   lungs are cleaning themselves out. I swear I am just so disgusted with smoking and that I have spent so many years doing this to myself!!   -- Christine C, September 17, 2005   I have been a smoker since I was 13.

Quit Smoking           Health Recovery Facts            W e     are all aware of the dangers of smoking.  Below are some      facts when you stop smoking-            20 minutes after quitting     smoking, your heart rate drops            12 hours after quitting     smoking, the carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal             24     hours after quitting smoking, the chance of having a heart attack     begins to decrease             2     weeks to 3 months after you stop smoking, blood circulation and lung     function may improve.             1     to 9 months after quitting smoking, the lungs can start to clean     themselves again.            You may notice youe coughing less and     aren as short of breath.             1     year after quitting, the risk of a heart attack is now half the risk     of a smoker.             5+     years after you stop smoking, the risk of a stroke is reduced to the     same risk as a person who has never smoked.           10 years after quitting     smoking, the risk of lung cancer is reduced.            There is less risk of cancers of the     mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, kidney, cervix and pancreas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Quit Smoking in Oregon                                                                     Smoking or chewing tobacco, like many     habits, tends to become more complex to stop the longer it has been     practiced.  But, it is always possible to stop.                                               Smokers do not tend to     try hypnosis to help them quit smoking until they have exhausted     every other option.  That means the people I see in my Salem,     Oregon office have very strong smoking habits.  Strong enough     to resist their previous efforts.  That's OK, I'm used to it,     and I can help.                                                                                                    Hypnosis to Quit     Smoking                                        The average     ex-smoker has tried to quit smoking seven times before being successful.      Knowing this quit smoking fact is often relieving to smokers that are working to     quit.  The next time you quit smoking, may be the last time.                      You may     know people who have  quit smoking  'cold turkey' only to immediately     start gaining weight or start another bad habit.   Once     a habit is created, it can be difficult to 'simply' quit.      Removing the habit action (smoking), will not always remove the          habit sequence  (trigger, craving, smoking).      Therefore, removing the cigarettes from your habit will not always     remove the craving.  If the craving to smoke is still present,     a person may substitute 'lesser' habits and remain more likely to     take up smoking again.                      People sometimes     describe  trying  to quit smoking like two different people     arguing in their head.  One part wants to quit and another part     wants to smoke.  This is normal for anyone trying to stop a     habit.  Hypnotherapy helps end these internal     arguments.                                                  Directly addressing and ""removing"" the      cravings, the behaviors, makes it much more comfortable to quit      smoking.  Though, of course, there is still effort      required.                                            People that have     prior quit smoking attempts often report increased cravings,     difficulty concentrating, and irritability    when they     stopped     smoking.  I work to control this side of the smoking habit too.  After one to two     sessions of hypnosis with me, most people report no cravings, no     irritability, and an increased sense of calmness and focus.      People that have smoked for 50 years are surprised when, the morning     after a quit smoking session, there is no craving to smoke. They feel     calm. They have     quit smoking and can now continue modifying any remaining behaviors     with this habit.                                                            How Hypnosis Can     Help You Stop Smoking                                                      The physical addiction to nicotine from      smoking      reportedly lasts from three to seven days after the last      cigarette.       Most smokers have been able to stop smoking for at least a few days.       Many have quit smoking beyond the first week of physical addiction before      falling back to the old smoking behaviors.  With      appropriate hypnosis,      once the smoking behaviors are addressed or replaced, it is      important to work on techniques and tools that make that first      week of not smoking easier.    This may      consist of creating new behaviors and emotional associations;      more appreciation of how good it feels to be a non-smoker,       the good feeling it gives you to be a good example in your      family,  a ""craving"" to drink more water, and more.                                                How the time is spent in a stop smoking session      is very important.  It clears room in your mind and creates      a new foundation for new behaviors.  After the stop smoking session, it      is important for you to remain focused on your goals as the new      behaviors take root.  To assist in this, stop smoking      programs will often supply CD's to listen to or teach you      different 'exercises' to do. In my experience audios and      exercises are both important.  The exercises are simple      to teach and for the client to remember.  The problem was      the stop smoking CD.  Most stop smoking CD's available are      at least 30 minutes long.  This makes them difficult to fit      into a busy day and often boring. But, I have found audio      support is very important in helping someone stop smoking.       Because of this, I created reinforcement audios to stop smoking      (CD or MP3) that average only 7 minutes long.  This makes      them very easy to listen to in the morning, after a meal, during      a work break, in the car, the common times you smoke.       (Hint: the quit smoking audio is only about 7 minutes long.. the      same time it takes to smoke a cigarette)  The times you      most need the extra support.  This makes it possible to      actually use my audios to stop smoking.  After spending the      few minutes to listen to a CD, people say they feel refreshed,      rested, relaxed and mentally clear.  If they had any      thoughts of smoking before, they are gone afterwards.                                                                        Long Term Quit      Smoking Results                                               From a few days to a few weeks after the last quit      smoking session, I      have follow-up contact with my clients.  I track client      success rates and feedback.  While I have formed my stop      smoking program with techniques from the top modern      hypnotists in the profession, I use the feedback to adapt and      further improve the program.  Taking into consideration,      client compliance, ease of use, comprehension, comfort level,      quit smoking success rate and acceptability.  Everyone is able to stop      smoking for a few days.  Your long term success is my      focus.  This may sound noble, but the fact of the matter      is, most of my clients come from the referrals of previous      successful clients.  Your long term quit smoking success  results in my      continued success.                                                                       Hypnotherapy       to stop smoking is  not  a magic cure. But, it  can       feel like a magic cure to those that make use of it.  It  can                   make the difference between failure and successfully quitting      smoking.                                                      Oregon BRFSS 2005 Behavioral Risk Surveillance     survey           20.6% of the males in Oregon and 16.6% of the     females in Oregon smoke.           In Oregon, almost all smokers began smoking     between ages 13 and 29.      Most smokers in Oregon believe people close to     them are upset about their smoking      Over half the smokers in Oregon are seriously considering     stopping smoking in the next six months.                        (For more data on health and      quit smoking )      Quit Smoking Methods     and Success Rates        There is a lot of conflicting success rate     information about quitting smoking.  In studies, modalities for a process are     not necessarily consistent.  Even the word 'success' can mean     different things in different studies; quit smoking immediately?  3 months     after?  6 months? One year?  What percent of the stopping     smoking study     group continued to report information during the study?          The only success rate     resport I have been satisfied with is taken from the American     Cancer Society,            Guide to Quitting Smoking ,     Oct. 26, 2006.        "" The truth is, quit     smoking programs, like other programs that treat addictions, often     have a fairly low success rate. But that does not mean they are not     worthwhile or that you should be discouraged. Your own success in     quitting is what really counts, and that is under       your      control.                About 5% to 16% of people are able to quit smoking for at least 6     months without any medicine to help with withdrawal. Several     articles in medical journals have reported that between about 25%     and about 33% of smokers who use medicines can remain smoke-free for     over 6 months. There is early evidence that combining some medicines     may be more effective than using them alone.           Behavioral and supportive therapies may increase success rates even     further. ""          and -           "" There are some programs     to watch out for as well. Not all programs are ethical. You should     be concerned about programs that do the following:                   Promise instant, easy success with no      effort on your part.                    Use injections or pills, especially      ""secret"" ingredients (nicotine replacement is covered      elsewhere).                    Charge a very high fee.

Conclusion      Since becoming available over the counter,        NRT appears no longer effective in increasing long-term     successful   cessation in California     smokers.                  Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 288, Number 10,     Pages 1260-1264, Sept. 11, 2002                   Hypnosis and Quit Smoking Information      Hypnosis to stop smoking has not been thoroughly studied.      Modalities, techniques and programs vary greatly from hypnotherapist to     hypnotherapist.  This creates study results that are not      effectively used or compared.        The modern hypnosis techniques I use, here in     Salem, are well     established within the profession.  My quit smoking hypnosis program's client reported success rate     stays above 70%.  Most clients report using no     medications or NRT.  Most smokers quit immediately after the     first session with no cravings.  Some use more than one session     to achieve desired results.  The successful clients have commonalities.      They have a desire to quit smoking and they follow my     program's simple recommendations.        I have worked with clients in Oregon making use of     quit smoking medications and/or NRT.  Of these, the best results were from     quit smoking clients using Chantix.       If hypnosis is an option for you, talk to the     hypnotists in your area.  Find the quit smoking program and hypnotist that     you are confident in.  Ask for a free consultation, if they     provide one.+             Hypnosis is Your Best Option to     Quit Smoking        There are a lot of different success rate claims.      I seem to be a little hard on myself when I do this.  I keep     track of every single client I work with.  Every one of my     stop smoking clients are non-smokers right after a session. They feel     great and report no cravings at all.  Some would call that a     100% success rate.  I do not.  Some people start smoking     again.  Sometimes within hours, and sometimes after several weeks     or     months.      They stopped smoking and it's often their choice to start again.      They do not call for additional help.  I consider these clients     to be ""drop-outs"".  They have initial success and do not finish     the process.  I count drop-outs against the over-all success     rate.  As I work to eliminate the different reasons for     drop-outs, like asking if a spouse or roommate is still smoking, my     client reported quit smoking success rates increase.  Of course I can't make     a client stop smoking if they really don't want to and if that     person going through the quit smoking session and starts smoking the next day, it     counts against the stop smoking success rate.  I consider it my     job to spot this.  To make sure the client does not start the     process and does not waste their money.      I report my success rate in this fashion because I     believe it is honest.  When a prospective client asks me my     quit smoking success rate, they want to know if 100 people came in     to stop smoking, how many would stop.  If I said 100% of the     people that come in 'and choose to stop smoking' do stop, it would     be technically true, but misleading.       - I'm  not  here to sell you kitchen knives with a     100% satisfaction guarantee.  I am here to provide you the most professional, ethical assistance in a life changing process.         There are a lot of options available to someone     that is planning to quit smoking.  From the options listed     above, I don't believe there is a ""wrong"" choice.      When it comes to stopping smoking, the only poor choice is putting     it off.      Find what works for you and do it.  If you live near Salem,     Oregon, I invite you to contact me for a free consultation to     explore the option of hypnosis to quit smoking.  If Salem is too far to drive,     I am happy to help you find a competent hypnotist in your area.                     Consumer     Awareness             Oregon is one of the last 13 states that     does not have a state certification for hypnosis.  This is both     good and bad.  It keeps hypnosis in the hands of those that     know it best -  practicing hypnotists .  But, it also     allows a wide variety of hypnotic techniques and skill levels to be accessible to the     public.  Oregon has had this issue in the legislature off and     on.  It probably makes little difference to the person in     Oregon looking     to stop smoking.  After all, that person generally cares much more     about results than they do about how they get the results.  I     only bring this issue up to make Oregon hypnosis clients as informed     as possible.  There are many wonderful hypnotists in Oregon.      If you have a bad experience, it is in everyone's interest if you     first communicate this with the hypnotist to resolve it.  If     not satisfied, report the problem to the Oregon Hypnotherapy     Association.  Then, look for a hypnotist you can be confident     in.                                                                                                                          How Much Do You Spend On Cigarettes?

However, FDA does have the authority to take action if cell phones are shown to emit radiofrequency energy (RF) at a level that is hazardous to the user. In such a case, FDA could require cell phone manufacturers to notify users of the health hazard and to repair, replace or recall the phones so that the hazard no longer exists.           Interagency Working Group             FDA belongs to the Radiofrequency Interagency Work Group. The federal agencies in this group have responsibility for different aspects of RF safety and work to ensure coordinated efforts at the federal level. The other agencies in this group are:                    National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health            Environmental Protection Agency            Federal Communications Commission            Occupational Safety and Health Administration            National Telecommunications and Information Administration                   Federal Communications Commission           FDA shares regulatory responsibilities for cell phones with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). FCC certifies wireless devices, and all phones that are sold in the United States must comply with FCC guidelines on RF exposure. FCC relies on the FDA and other health agencies on health and safety related questions about cell phones.           FCC also regulates cell phone base stations. These base stations operate at higher power than cell phones. The RF exposures people experience from base stations are typically much lower than from cell phones because base station antennas are mounted on towers or other building structures and are thus substantially farther away from the public. Both cell phones and base stations are required to comply with FCC RF exposure guidelines.           International Workgroup          For the past several years, delegations from Japan, Korea, the European Union, Australia, China, the World Health Organization, and the United States have met to discuss health concerns for wireless telecommunications. The purpose of these workshops has been to discuss scientific issues related to RF exposure from wireless communications technology from an international perspective. Specific topics addressed have included:                    health effects of emerging wireless technologies            recent biological research            standards development            prospects for international collaboration related to the safety of wireless telecommunication devices.

clueweb09-en0006-11-21059	"                   DrugLibrary Drug News -- Latest drug news from around the world     Your guide to making money in the multi-billion dollar marijuana industry                                                                         Medical Marijuana Approved in Sonoma County     Miracle On Administration Drive     By: Lazar Yersersky On Tuesday,     October l2, 1994 before a standing-room-only crowd at the County Supervisors' hearing, Sonoma County at last passed a resolution approving the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Presented by Ernie Carpenter, supervisors Tim Smith and Mike Cale voted for. Nick Esposti was the sole vote against. The resolution, written mainly by Carol Miller, who, in spite of bringing up a gang of kids with Michael, living on a remote mountain without a car for at least a year, not to mention fighting Lymes disease all the while, never flagged in her mission of freeing marijuana for medical use. Dr Tod Mikuriya, author of the authoritative ""Medical Marijuana Papers,"" spoke first. Caregiver ""Brownie"" Mary Rathburn testified to a standing ovation for her work and her indomitable spirit. Dennis Peron, who ram- rodded the SF ballot victory, spoke, and Bruce Sloan gave them what-for as only he can do, with his testimony before the supervisors and with his nifty sign to ""Repeal Hemp Prohibition and Restore Health"" outside. Then the parade of patients began: Patti, Beth, and Barb with AIDS. I use first names only because these very ill people are criminals as things stand--or at least stood before today. Patti drove herself to the hearing even though she was almost too sick to talk. Beth, a cancer patient, spoke. Chuck, an asthmatic, literally given the breath of life by a few daily tokes of marijuana, was there. And a phys ed teacher half crippled with a back injury suffered when a drunk ran into his car, explained that only marijuana stopped his debilitating muscle spasms, allowing him to stretch and heal his back when synthetic pharmaceuticals, with their often toxic side effects, could not. Sara was there suffering from giardia that wasted her away until marijuana cured the awful nausea and allowed her to eat. Linette, who was busted for two plants in Fairfax, was there. Now we must unite in support of Sen. Henry Mello's Medical Legalization Bill on the state level. And federal bills S. 784 and H.R. l709, which will roll back restrictive regulations on nutritional products and medical herbs (including cannabis) need our support. We must now endeavor to get the ear of Bill Clinton or maybe Hillary. Congratulations to S.C.R.A.P. and to everyone who worked so hard and so long to get to this point.

When you quit smoking you are setting yourself free from a number of things...       The gift of quitting smoking is more than just the freedom from nicotine. When you quit smoking you are setting yourself free. Free from the constant running to buy cigarettes, the looking for a place to smoke, and the social ostracism. When you quit smoking you are enabling a whole different life to come to you.    The Struggle    Quitting smoking is not an easy task and many people struggle for years as they try to quit. Smokers who want to quit are constantly looking for the best advise and techniques that will help them quit for real this time. So many smokers try quitting just to start back up in a week or month or year later.    How to become smoke-free is not an easy question. Tobacco and nicotine have different effects on different people. So there is not a cookie cutter recipe to giving up smoking or tobacco use. Many people are able to quit smoking and be smokeless for the rest of their lives, but they still feel like they are constantly struggling to not smoke a cigarette.     For people who are contemplating quitting smoking it can be a scary idea. Cigarettes and nicotine have become part of their daily life. They have worked their lives around when and where they can get a cigarette. Most of their friends may also be smokers, which will make quitting even more difficult for them.     What to do?    The best approach for people who want to quit smoking is to start building a base of friends and family that are supportive of their interest in quitting. Once the word is out that a person wants to stop smoking there may be other friends that smoke who would like to quit as well.    Support during the cessation period is extremely important and can be a precursor to the person sticking to their stop smoking plans. If you are surrounded by people who are genuinely proud of you, when you quit, and encouraging to you it is easier to quit smoking.     Quitting smoking is not only a gift to the smoker but it is also a gift to their family. Many families have struggled for years trying to get a loved one to quit smoking. Even smokers who constantly smoke away from their loved ones are still bringing the smell and discomfort into their home. It is a gift to a family when a smoker decides to quit and start working towards a being a healthier person.     Even smokers who quit smoking cold turkey continue to have medical risks. The medical risks of smoking are extreme and include things like lung cancer and other respiratory ailments. Smokers are also prone to yellowing of the teeth and bridle hair. It is a gift to the smoker when they finally decide to start putting their health in front of their desire to smoke cigarettes.     The freedom that not smoking can bring a person is a great motivation for smokers of any level. Even extremely heavy smokers can be motivated to quit smoking when they realize they are taking their own health and well being away from the people that love them the most.     Quitting smoking is one of the most difficult addiction-breaking processes one can go through.

Hurting Yourself    Smoking is an addiction. Tobacco contains nicotine, a drug that is addictive. The nicotine, therefore, makes it very difficult (although not impossible) to quit.Smoking greatly increases the risk of getting lung cancer,  heart attack , chronic lung disease,  stroke , and many other cancers (like cancer of the bladder). Moreover, smoking is perhaps the most preventable cause of breathing (respiratory) diseases - Lung cancer, Emphysema, Bronchitis, Pneumonia within the USA.

Exposure to passive smoke can also cause cancer.Secondhand smoke also increases the risk of stroke and heart disease.

Even in households where only one parent smokes, young people are more likely to start smoking.

You start taking bupropion for 1-2 weeks before you plan to stop smoking.    If you want to stop smoking, taking bupropion ( Zyban) Bupropion roughly doubles your chance of success. For many smokers, Bupropion ( Zyban) is the  best stop smoking medication  available, since no more nicotine is being consumed.    What is Bupropion ( Zyban) and How does it Work?   Bupropion ( Zyban) is a drug first developed to treat depression. It was found that it helped smokers quit  smoking. It is not clear how the medication works. It alters the level of some chemicals in the brain (neurotransmitters). This seems to relieve the withdrawal symptoms that you get when you stop smoking (such as craving, anxiety, restlessness, headaches, irritability, hunger, difficulty with concentration, or just feeling awful).   How Effective is bupropion ( Zyban) ?    About twice the number of smokers who take Bupropion stop smoking compared to those who don't. Up to 1 in 5 smokers who really want to stop will do it with the help of bupropion.  >>  Study    How do I take Bupropion?       Start by taking one tablet (150 mg) of the medication each day for six days. Then increase to one tablet twice a day, at least eight hours apart. Do not take more than one tablet at any one time, and not more than two tablets in a day     Aim to stop smoking completely on day eight of treatment. This allows Bupropion to build up in your body before you stop smoking.      You should continue Bupropion for a further seven weeks.          Bupropion does not 'make' you stop smoking. You still need determination to succeed, and to break the smoking habit. A combination of Bupropion with counselling from a nurse, doctor, pharmacist, or other health professional increases your chance of successfully stopping smoking.    Are there any Side-effects?   Most people take Bupropion without any problem. Read the packet leaflet for a full list of possible side-effects and cautions.The most common are:    - a dry mouth    - sleep disturbance   - drowsiness    - seizures    - high blood pressure      Blood pressure sometimes goes up in people who take Bupropion. This is more common in people who take Bupropion plus nicotine replacement therapy at the same time (nicotine gum, etc). You should have a baseline blood pressure reading done before you start treatment and it should be monitored from time to time. It should be checked weekly if you take Bupropion plus nicotine replacement therapy.   Persons Who should not take Bupropion   You should not take bupropion if you:       are under the age of 18.     are pregnant or breastfeeding.     have ever had epilepsy, a seizure (fit or convulsion), or an unexplained blackout     have ever had anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa     have bipolar affective disorder (manic depression)     are withdrawing abruptly from benzodiazepines or alcohol dependence      have a tumour of the brain or spinal cord     have had a previous allergic reaction to bupropion tablets     Bupropion should be used with caution if you have heart disease. However, if you have heart disease, the benefits of stopping smoking usually outweigh other concerns. Also, the dose may need to be reduced if you have some medical conditions, or if you take certain medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you:       have ever had a serious head injury.     have diabetes that is treated with insulin or medicines.      drink a lot of alcohol.     have a liver or kidney disease.     Whilst you are taking Bupropion, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are prescribed or buy any new medication. Also, tell a doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medications.       Anti-malarial medcations (for example, chloroquine, proguanil)     Antihistamines.     Medications to treat depression or other mental illness.

""Studies  undertaken in academic settings have shown that bupropion hydrochloride  can double the odds of smoking cessation compared with placebo,"" write  Roldano Fossati, MD, from the Università degli Studi di Milano in  Milan, Italy, and colleagues from the General Practice Tobacco  Cessation Investigators Group. ""To assess whether these results are  applicable in primary care, we launched a double-blind,  placebo-controlled, randomized trial to be conducted by general  practitioners.""   From April 2004 to May 2005, 71 Italian general  practitioners enrolled 593 healthy smokers in this study, of whom 400  were randomized to receive bupropion hydrochloride, 150 mg twice a day,  and 193 were randomized to receive placebo daily for 7 weeks. During  the 1-year study, participants had 4 clinical visits and 3 telephone  calls, in addition to the baseline visit. The main outcome measures  were biochemically confirmed continuous abstinence at week 7 and at  week 52.   From week 4 to week 7, 41.0% of the subjects in the  bupropion group were continuously abstinent, as were 22.3% of those in  the placebo group (multivariate odds ratio [OR], 2.37; 95% confidence  interval [CI], 1.60 - 3.53). From week 4 to week 52, the rates of  continuous abstinence were 25% in the bupropion group and 14% in the  placebo group (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.32 - 3.39).   Mean weight gain  was similar in both groups. For long-term abstainers, weight gain was 3  kg in women and 4 kg in men. Although more participants in the  bupropion group vs the placebo group had an adverse event, the  percentage discontinuing use of the study medication was similar in  both groups.   ""Bupropion  more than doubled the odds of continuous  abstinence from smoking ,"" the study authors write. ""The adherence of  general practitioners and participants to the protocol was excellent,  making our findings robust and easy to generalize to the context of  primary care.""   Limitations of the study include less frequent  follow-up visits vs that reported in other studies, which could lead to  an underestimation of adverse events; nonmedical factors such as the  clinician-patient relationship might have influenced the selection of  the study population and compliance; and the concern that 3 telephone  calls and 5 visits in a year might be an excessive burden for most  primary care clinics.   ""The adherence of GPs [general  practitioners] and participants to the research protocol was  excellent,"" the investigators conclude. ""Bupropion was efficacious,  with an absolute 25% of participants continuously abstinent at 1 year;  it doubled the odds of continuous abstinence from week 4 to week 7 and  from week 4 to week 52 compared with placebo and was also well  tolerated. This study, conducted in the general practice setting, does  not simply replicate previous studies undertaken in academic centers  but also provides reliable data that physicians may use to make their  best evidence-based decisions in the difficult task of helping people  quit smoking.""
