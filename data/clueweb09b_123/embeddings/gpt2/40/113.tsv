However, hunting licenses expire at the end of the calendar year. If  you plan to go afield after Dec. 31 for quail, rabbit, archery deer or other  pursuits, be sure to stop by a licensed dealer or department office and pick up  a new 2009 General Hunting license (class G).   For those who hunt and fish, the Combo Hunt and Fish license (class F) is the  best choice. It is cheaper than buying each license separately and it includes  your trout stamp.   Families with children between ages 14 and 18 can take advantage of the  Family Combo Hunt Fish license (class K) and save big. A family of four can hunt  small game (and other game, with appropriate tags) and fish in all state waters,  including trout, for less than $35 per family member. Add an Urban Fishing  license (class U) for everyone in the family and enjoy fishing at any of the 21  waters, stocked regularly, for your fishing pleasure.   Dedicated resident sportsmen cannot go wrong with the Super Conservation  Combo Hunt and Fish license (class N), which comes with more accessories than a  Swiss army knife. Not only do you get the general hunting and fishing license, a  trout stamp is included, as is the urban fishing license. Now the good stuff:  The package includes a dove stamp, a state duck stamp (the federal stamp must be  purchased separately), an over-the-counter archery deer tag (open units subject  to change), a fall archery turkey tag, a fall bear tag and a mountain lion tag.  The cost is only $163  a $50 savings. If you dont fish, just get the Super  Hunting License (class M) for $118, which is still a $37 savings.   In addition, new this year is the Apprentice Hunting License (class H). This  is a free two-day general hunting license for introducing someone new to  hunting. Designed as a try before you buy program, this license is obtained  from any Arizona Game and Fish Department office at no cost by a licensed adult  18 or older. This person takes on the role of mentor and takes an apprentice  (friend, family member, co-worker, or neighbor) out hunting for small game and  teaches them the basics of hunting. Mentors are an important component to  preserve the hunting heritage and to promote the conservation value that hunters  provide. For more information about the Apprentice Hunting License, see the  article in this issue.

It is the sequel to  Konami 's  Track & Field  and features seven all-new  Olympic  events. Like its predecessor,  Hyper Sports  featured two run buttons and one action button per player. This game is also known as  Hyper Olympic '84  outside North America.   While not quite achieving the commercial and critical success of  Track and Field ,  Hyper Sports  still proved to be very popular among gamers and, like its prequel, really came into its own as a highly addictive multi-player experience.     [ edit ]   Gameplay   The gameplay was much the same as  Track & Field  in that the player competes in an event and tries to score the most points based on performance criteria, and also by beating the computer entrants in that event. Also, the player tries to exceed a qualification time, distance or score in order to advance to the next event. In Hyper Sports, if all of the events were passed successfully, the player advances to the next round of the same events which are faster and harder to qualify for.   The events changed to include these new sports:     Freestyle swimming  - Swimming speed is controlled by two run buttons, and breathing is controlled by the action button when prompted by swimmer on screen. There is one re-do if a player fouls due to launching before the gun, but only one ""run"" at the qualifying time.       Skeet shooting  - Selecting left or right shot via the two run buttons while a clay-bird is in the  sight . There are three rounds to attempt to pass the qualifying score. If a perfect score is attained then a different pattern follows allowing for a higher score.       Vaulting horse  - Speed to run at horse is computer controlled, player jumps and pushes off horse via the action button, and rotates as many times as possible via run buttons (and tries to land straight up on feet). There are three attempts at the qualifying score.       Archery  - Firing of the arrow controlled by action button; the elevation angle is controlled by depressing the action button and releasing at the proper time. There are three attempts at passing the qualifying score.       Triple jump  - Speed is controlled by the run buttons, jump and angle are controlled by action button. There are three attempts at the qualifying distance, and player fouls if first jump is after the white line.       Weight lifting  - Power used to lift weights is controlled by run buttons, while shift of weight from lifting up to pushing above the head is controlled by action button. There are two attempts at the qualifying weight.       Pole vault  - Speed to run is preset by computer, while release of pole and body movement is controlled by the action button. Player continues attempting the increasing heights until he/she fouls out (by missing base at the bottom or by knocking off horizontal bar with body at the top). The third foul disqualifies the player.

clueweb09-en0007-27-31942	"     Documents Homepage  ::   World of Sports Science   ::  A-Ba (and timeline)          Archery              Archery is a sport that is among the oldest of recorded competitive activities. Cultures as diverse as the Chinese, indigenous North American peoples, and early Europeans placed value on the ability of men to skillfully use a bow and arrow. The legends of William Tell and Robin Hood centered upon the talent of each character to shoot an arrow with unerring accuracy. When archers were displaced in English armies through the development of firearms and cannon in the 1600s, archery gained popularity as a competitive sport.   Archery was introduced to the Olympics in 1900, and the sport was contested through the Games of 1920, when it was removed from the Olympic roster as a result of disputes among the competing nations regarding the appropriate rules for competition. Archery was reinstated to Olympic status at the Summer Games of 1972. Archery is also included at the Summer Paralympics as a wheelchair sport. As with the sports of the ancient Olympics that are still part of the modern games, archery is a sport that has not changed to a significant degree since medieval times.   FITA, the international archery federation, is the governing body for the sport worldwide. Modern archery is organized into men's and women's divisions, both as individual competitions and as team events. The usual international events require a competitor to deliver a prescribed number of arrows into a target from a variety of distances. For men, the distances are 30 m, 50 m, 70 m, and 90 m; for women, the maximum competitive distance is 70 m. The targets are divided into ten zones, with zone widths varying depending on the distance from which the archer shoots. The sport is very simple in its execution, as the archer with the most arrows delivered closest to the bulls' eye, the center of the target, is the winner. While physical strength and general fitness are important to an elite-level archery competitor, archery is a sport where physical size is not of primary importance.   As a machine, a bow is any stringed projectile weapon designed to shoot arrows. The modern bow used in archery competition is of the same approximate shape and dimension as the long bows first used by the English army at the Battle of Crecy in 1346 to defeat their French enemy. The modern bow is constructed from carbon fiber and other similar composite materials to create a maximum degree of response to the pull of the archer. The shooting of an arrow involves the application of a series of physical principles. The expression, ""translation of energy,"" is important in the understanding of how the arrow is delivered with maximum effect. As the archer prepares to draw back the bowstring, the potential energy available to the arrow rests in the muscles of the archer's arm and shoulders. Once the bowstring is drawn, the potential energy is transferred from the archer to the bowstring. When the bowstring is released, virtually all of the stored potential energy in the bowstring is transferred to become the kinetic energy that powers the arrow into flight.   The flight of the arrow is a product of a number of physical factors. The velocity at which the arrow is released, the angle (calculated as the number of degrees above horizontal that the bow and arrow are aimed), the mass of the arrow, and the impact of air resistance and wind all contribute to the manner in which the arrow will travel.   Archery is a deceptive sport in terms of the approach to physical training and fitness required of the competitive archer. The general desirable physical qualities in an archer are strength, particularly in the core strength elements of the abdominal, lumbar (lower back), and groin, to provide stability to the archer as the arrows are shot. Flexibility is also an important quality, as is muscular strength in the upper body, to effectively draw back and deliver the arrows.   Aerobic fitness and a corresponding ability to control the heart rate of the athlete in the stress of competition is of critical importance to the competitive archer. Aerobic fitness assists an archer in offsetting the fatigue that results from standing for several hours through a competition, where during the delivery of the arrows the athlete must be strong and physically prepared to compete. The high level of mental focus required to concentrate during every attempt at a target (the archer may deliver over 50 arrows in a single session) is best supported by a body that is fit.   Archers employ a variety of mental conditioning techniques to prepare themselves for an event. Many of these devices include both visualization of the physical movements that the archer will complete to shoot a perfect arrow; other techniques encourage the athlete to use imagery to relax prior to the event.    Archery is a deceptive sport in terms of the approach to physical training and fitness required of the competitive archer.    As a general proposition, the lower an archer's heart rate, the steadier the aim. The rate at which the heart beats is a function of the autonomic nervous system, which controls other involuntary systems such as respiration. Most competitive archers employ one of a variety of deep breathing techniques prior to the actual delivery of an arrow to take the pulse to its lowest possible rate to create the greatest degree of stability and control over the delivery of the arrow.

Posted on: 01/02/09 [ Comments? ]                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Effective Jan. 1, the Arizona Game and Fish Department is offering a new ""Apprentice Hunting License,"" at no charge, to encourage existing hunters to become mentors and introduce a friend, neighbor, relative, or co-worker to the traditions and importance of hunting.    The Apprentice License allows an already licensed hunter to take a beginner on an actual huntwithout the beginner having to buy a hunting license. The Apprentice License is free for residents and nonresidents and is valid for two consecutive days for the take of small game, fur-bearing, predatory and nongame mammals, nongame birds, and upland game birds. (To take migratory birds or waterfowl, the appropriate stamps are required at normal costs). The license is not valid for the take of big game.    Many people express an interest in hunting but are deterred either because of not knowing how to get started or the initial expense. The Apprentice Hunting License removes the initial cost barrier of having to buy a license (which costs between $26.50 and $151.25, depending on age and residency), so that newcomers can ""try before they buy.""    ""This will allow a seasoned hunter to take someone new under their wing and teach them the basics about hunting, firearm safety, and wildlife conservation without cost prohibitive burdens,"" said Chairman Bill McLean of the Arizona Game and Fish Commission. ""There are many states with this type of license, and it has become a model for removing barriers in the national effort to increase hunter participation.""    The Apprentice Hunting License is only available at Arizona Game and Fish Department offices. The mentor must be at least 18 years old and possess a valid hunting license and is limited to two Apprentice Hunting Licenses per calendar year. The license must be made out to the name of the apprentice, with the mentor's name associated with the license. The apprentice can only receive one license per calendar year. The mentor is required to be with the apprentice at all times while in the field, providing instruction and supervision on safe and ethical hunting.    ""Arizona's hunting heritage and wildlife management through the next generation,"" said Craig McMullen, Hunter Heritage Work Group team leader for the Arizona Game and Fish Department. ""Not only will this allow someone new to experience the thrill of the hunt, this also allows mentors to teach others about wildlife conservation and the important role that hunters, as conservationists play, in the management of all wildlife.""    ""Outside of getting new hunters in the field, safety is our number one concern. Hunting in Arizona is very safe, and we have one of the lowest accident rates in the United States,"" said Dave Williams, hunter education coordinator of the Arizona Game and Fish Department. ""A good mentor will instill the basics of wearing hunter orange and how to safely handle a firearm through T.A.B.+1: Treat every firearm as if it were loaded; Always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction; Be sure of your target and beyond; and keep your finger outside of the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot. Nearly every hunting-related accident can be avoided by following these simple principles""    However, with the added flexibility comes added responsibility. Mentors need to set a good example to these impressionable new comers. Mentors should consider the following guidelines:         * Focus on the experience not the harvest       * Obey all laws       * Keep your apprentices physical limits in mind       * Be informative       * Teach field dressing and cooking       * Take pictures       * Plan a follow-up outing     Seasoned hunters can start the New Year giving. By introducing someone new to hunting, you are giving the gift of the American hunting heritage. Quail season runs until Feb. 8, 2009, cottontail rabbit season runs all year long and the both make excellent quarry (as well as, great table fare) for new hunters. A 2009 hunting license is required beginning Jan. 1, 2009.

Don't forget that Monday, Oct. 13 is a state holiday, Columbus Day, so the Game and Fish offices will be closed.    Arizona Game and Fish Department officials said the spring hunt application process is for javelina, bearded turkey, bear and buffalo. Don't forget, there is something new this coming spring - there are over-the-counter non-permit turkey tags for youth.    Department officials pointed out that it is once again a manual application process for the spring hunts - there is NO online application process available.    Spring hunt regulations should be available at all license dealers statewide, or stop by any of the seven Arizona Game and Fish Department offices in the state. The applications and regulations can also be downloaded from the Game and Fish Department's Web site at  www.azgfd.gov  . Don't miss out!    By the way, department biologists said the terrific green up last spring coupled with the abundant rainfall this summer should equate to a good year for javelina. The excellent mast crop in the high country this year bodes well for turkey populations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Southwest U.S. Forum Topics                                                                                                                              The  Southwest U.S. Forum  has  339 Active Topics                                                       New Mexico Makes Big Changes for 2009-10 ATV's durning Hunting season riverside and san bernadino county Unit 21 Archery Javelina Hunt Information Please                                                                                                                                                                  Visit                    the Forums                                                                    Photos and Stories                                                                                                                                                    Oregon Blacktail Buck Hunt                             We were walking back to the vehicles after a rainy day of hunting on the Oregon coast.

clueweb09-en0007-27-32254	"     Documents Homepage  ::   World of Sports Science   ::  Sc-Sp          Shooting              Shooting, also known as sport shooting has been a competitive sport in a variety of forms since the mid-1800s. Competitions that involved pursuits such big game hunting, target shooting, and the hunting of a wide variety of birds were all contested in various parts of the world. The first prominent organization created to advance the interest of serious sport shooters and marksmen was the National Rifle Association, formed in the United States in 1871.   Throughout its history as a competitive sport, shooting has encompassed many different types of firearms. ""Gun"" is a term used interchangeably with firearm. At its most basic, a firearm is any barreled device capable of discharging a projectile. By the time of the first modern Olympics in 1896, competitive shooting was conducted in separate divisions for three types of firearms; rifles, pistols, and shotguns. A rifle is a long barreled firearm that has spiral grooves machined along the interior of the barrel; the spiral grooves, or rifling, create a rotary motion when the bullet is fired. The spin imparted to the bullet by the rifling tends to produce a more accurate shot. A rifle is typically discharged from the shoulder position of the shooter. A pistol is small firearm designed to be held and discharged from a single hand of the shooter. Both pistols and rifles may be powered by the force of conventional gunpowder contained in the cartridge that contains the bullet to be fired. The explosive force of the gunpowder is initiated when the trigger on the firearm is pulled by the shooter. Other types of both pistols and rifles are powered by systems that employ either compressed air mechanisms or pressurized gases.   A shotgun has a long barrel, one typically shorter and thicker than that of a rifle. The inside of the shotgun barrel is smooth, as the projectiles discharged are not a single object, as with a rifle bullet, but are numerous tiny projectiles, referred to as ""shot"". Shotguns are not as accurate as either rifles or pistols, but are an effective device in covering a wider area with the discharged ammunition.   The International Sport Shooting Federation, ISSF, is the governing body for shooting competitions through out the world. There are 17 different categories of shooting recognized at the Olympic games, seven open to women and 10 restricted to male competitors. Until 1996, a number of shooting categories at the Olympics were designated as mixed events, open to competitors of either gender. In addition to the various types of rifle and pistol shooting where the marksman attempts to shoot at a distant target, there are two general classes of moving target competitions involving trap and skeet. The trap is a device that propels specially constructed clay targets into the air at a specified distance from the shooter. In Olympic competition, the shooter must attempt to shoot 125 of the targets, from a total of five different shooting positions. In the event called double trap, two clay targets are released simultaneously at differing angles, requiring the shooter to make successive shots on the targets.   Skeet is also an event involving shot guns. The shooters assume a series of positions during the competitions, attempting to strike the targets, sometime referred to as ""clay pigeons"" after they are propelled into the air.   Shooting also is an important element of a winter sports discipline, the biathlon, where the competitors complete a series of laps on a cross country ski course, with intervals in which the athletes are required to shoot at set targets with a rifle from both prone and standing positions. The combination of endurance, strength, and precise marksmanship, accomplished while the athlete attempts to steady their body from the rigors of skiing, make the biathlon one of the most difficult Winter Olympic sports.   As with many sports where muscle power is not a prerequisite, shooting appears deceptively simple.  Female athletes shooting air pistols as part of 2000 Olympic Games (pentathlon).  The ability to steady hand and mind to deliver a sequence of shots requires well-developed powers of concentration and emotional control. Elite shooters spend considerable training time developing skills in visualization, where they direct their mental powers to the entire sequence of a successful shot, as an aid in coordinating their physical and mental efforts.   The greater the level of physical fitness possessed by a competitive shooter, the more likely they are to achieve competitive success. Many shooters attempt to fire at a target between heartbeats, when the body is at its most stable. The more fit the athlete, generally, the lower the heart rate. A lower heart rate will provide the shooter with a greater window within which to deliver the shot. The breathing exercises that are often performed by shooters during competition to relax the body have a more pronounced effect on a body that has both a fit cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory system.   Shooting has known its share of performance enhancing drug concerns. The best known of the drugs used by shooters to relax themselves and potentially slow their heart rate are alcohol and beta blockers, both banned substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List. Beta block-ers are drugs used to treat a number of cardiovascular conditions; they have the effect of slowing heart rate and reducing blood pressure, an advantage in shooting.

Deerjack   Deer-jacked! Hunter is held up   November 28, 2006   ASSOCIATED PRESS   MEADVILLE, Pa. - Three men stole a hunter’s doe at gunpoint, the hunter said.   “I’m really, really upset about the whole ordeal,” said Robert Hanna, 42, of Meadville, Pa.. “(It’s) over a dumb deer. If they wanted it so bad I would have said, ‘Take it.’”   Hanna said he shot the deer on Monday afternoon and was getting ready to come down from his tree stand when he was approached by three men with rifles.   They ordered him to empty his rifle and throw his gun down and one of the men then knocked him to the ground, he said.   “It’s an armed robbery and an assault,” said Vernon Township Sgt. Randy Detzel. “They knocked him to the ground and took his deer.”   Police had no suspects.

First-come javelina hunt tags are still available   Looking for a great holiday gift idea? There are still several thousand javelina hunt-permit tags available for the spring 2007 hunts on a first-come, first-served basis by U.S. mail only from the Arizona Game and Fish Department.   To find out what hunts have javelina tags available, visit azgfd.gov/draw or call (602) 789-3702. Keep in mind that each work day, the number of permits remaining can dwindle as applications are received and processed.   Department officials stressed that those who apply for the leftover tags need to pay attention to the new increased fees for licenses and tags for 2007 on page two of the spring hunt regulation supplement.   Those applying for the first-come, first-served process might also keep in mind that there are super new license deals available for 2007, including a new family license, a super conservation hunting license (includes various tags and stamps), and a super conservation combination hunt/fish license, which are available at department offices.   As a side note, dont forget there is a change in the timing to apply for elk and antelope during the upcoming year: 2007 will be the first year the department conducts a winter draw, or lottery, for elk and antelope tags. The application deadline for elk and antelope is Feb. 13. Hunt permit-tags and refund warrants will be mailed out by April 27.   The department will begin accepting applications for elk and antelope as soon as the regulations are posted on the departments Web site at azgfd.gov. That posting should occur by the end of December. The printed regulations should be available at hunting license dealers by Jan. 12.

TUCSON, Ariz. — The Arizona Game and Fish Department is asking for the public’s help in finding a poacher that killed a mature mule deer buck and a fawn near Willcox on Nov. 11 or 12.   The deer were shot in Game Management Unit 32 in a hay field near Willcox. According to Wildlife Manager John Bacorn, both deer were found on Monday morning, Nov. 13, where they were left in the field to waste.   “We need help from the public in catching the poachers,” said Bacorn. “If you were in the area recently, please think back about anything you might have seen or heard or any conversations you might have had. Maybe someone doesn’t realize he or she has the key to solving this case.”   The poaching of these animals is considered a major loss for the residents of Arizona and our wildlife resources.   Anyone with information about this poaching can call the department’s Operation Game Thief hotline toll-free at (800) 352-0700. A quick report of any poaching case to the department is important, in order to preserve any evidence. Callers may be eligible for a reward, and all calls can remain confidential upon request.

If you don’t think these kinds of issues are coming to Arizona, it’s time to wake up and have a whiff of Folgers….   On November 7, Michigan voters defeated Proposal 3, a referendum that would have allowed mourning dove hunting, by a margin of 68 percent to 32 percent. Anti-hunters financed the multi-million dollar campaign.   The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), the nation’s most powerful anti-hunting group, bankrolled the effort to ban the hunt with $1.6 million in contributions out of $2.3 million spent by the opponents’ campaign. Its contributions reveal a 250 percent increase over its previous record amount spent on a wildlife issue.   The HSUS and its puppet organization, the Committee to Restore the Dove Shooting Ban, purchased television airtime and ran anti-hunting messages throughout the final six weeks of the campaign.   This level of spending on a ballot issue is unprecedented for HSUS, and confirms sportsmen’s greatest fears about the retooled animal rights organization, which merged with the Fund for Animals in 2005. The merger put anti-hunting zealots in charge of more than $100 million that could be spent to take away hunting rights.   The sportsmen-led Citizens for Wildlife Conservation Committee, formed to defend the dove hunt, never truly got off the ground in its efforts to match the financial largesse of the anti-hunting campaign. The group raised less than $500,000, and was able to muster only a week-long radio campaign to combat the antis’ television ads.   The U.S. Sportsmen’s Alliance was one of the largest contributors to the campaign to protect the hunt, which had been established by the legislature in 2004.

PETA   Nov 25, 7:18 AM EST   PETA Mistakenly Targets Alaska Church   Advertisement  News Video   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The pastor at Anchorage First Free Methodist Church was mystified. Why was the activist group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals chastising him? No animals are harmed in the church’s holiday nativity display. In fact, animals aren’t used at all.   People, however, do dress the parts - Mary, Joseph, the wise men, etc. The volunteers stand shivering at a manger on the church lawn in a silent tribute to Christmas.   The Rev. Jason Armstrong was confused by an e-mail this week from PETA, which admonished him for subjecting animals “to cruel treatment and danger,” by forcing them into roles in the church’s annual manger scene.   “We’ve never had live animals, so I just figured this was some spam thing,” Armstrong said. “It’s rough enough on us people standing out there in the cold. So we’re definitely not using animals.”   Jackie Vergerio, PETA’s captive animals in entertainment specialist, said her organization tracks churches nationwide that use real animals in “living nativity scenes.”   Seems the confusion started with the church’s choice of phrase. PETA flagged Free Methodist’s display as a “living nativity,” and indeed, that’s how the church describes it on its Web site.   To PETA, that means animals.   “Those animals are subject to all sorts of terrible fates in some cases,” Vergerio said. “Animals have been stolen and slaughtered, they’ve been raped, they’ve escaped from the nativity scenes and have been struck by cars and killed. Just really unfathomable things have happened to them.”   Buy AP Photo Reprints   In the letter to Armstrong, Vergerio shared some sad fates of previous nativity animals - like Brighty the donkey, snatched from a nativity scene in Virginia and beaten by three young men. Ernie the camel fled a creche in Maryland but was struck and killed by a car. Two sheep and a donkey had to be euthanized after a dog mauling at a manger scene in Virginia.   Free Methodist’s display is peaceful, Armstrong said. The congregation erects the stable. Members spread straw and don costumes. Some even dress as manger animals.   “We have some puppet camel things we put out,” Armstrong said. “We have a cow hood thing that a person will wear that actually just looks spooky.”   The volunteers stand beneath a brightly lit electric star as Christmas music fills the frosty air. They don’t even speak.   “No one’s come by protesting or thrown bloodstained fur at us or anything,” Armstrong said. “We even use a plastic baby.”                                 Posted on 25th November 2006      Under:  General  |    1 Comment »                 Bobcat vs Deer                                  Wow - cool trailcam sequence   Bobcat                                 Posted on 24th November 2006      Under:  General  |    No Comments »                 The Longest Minute                                  Wow - a GREAT story posted by a gent over on Monster Muleys   Story                                 Posted on 24th November 2006      Under:  Hunting  |    No Comments »                 Happy Thanksgiving                                  Thanksgiving                                 Posted on 23rd November 2006      Under:  General  |    No Comments »                 Now this is beyond weird                                  Ummm Okayyyy…   Man accused of having sex with dead deer   Duluth News Tribune  Nov. 15, 2006 03:13 PM   DULUTH, Minn. - Prosecution of a case involving alleged sexual contact with a dead deer may hinge on the legal definition of the word “animal.”   Bryan James Hathaway, 20, of Superior, Wis., faces a misdemeanor charge of sexual gratification with an animal. He is accused of having sex with a dead deer he saw beside a road on Oct. 11.   A motion filed last week by his attorney, public defender Fredric Anderson, argued that since the deer was dead, it was not considered an animal and the charge should be dismissed.  advertisement     “The statute does not prohibit one from having sex with a carcass,” Anderson wrote.   Judge Michael Lucci heard the motion Tuesday.   “I’m a little surprised this issue hasn’t been tackled before in another case,” Lucci said.   The Webster’s dictionary defines “animal” as “any of a kingdom of living beings,” Anderson said.   If you include carcasses in that definition, he said, “you really go down a slippery slope with absurd results.”   Anderson argued: When does a turkey cease to be an animal? When it is dead?   When it is wrapped in plastic packaging in the freezer? When it is served, fully cooked?   A judge should decide what the Legislature intended “animal” to mean in the statute, he said. “And the only clear point to draw the line in that definition, I believe, is the point of death.”   Assistant District Attorney James Boughner said the court can use a dictionary to determine the meaning of the word, but it doesn’t have to.   “The common and ordinary meaning of a word can be found in how people actually use the word,” Boughner wrote in his response to the motion.   When a person’s pet dog dies, he told Lucci, the person still refers to the dog as his or her dog, not a carcass.   “It stays a dog for some time,” Boughner said.   He referred to the criminal complaint, in which Hathaway told police he saw the dead deer in the ditch and moved it into the woods. Hathaway called it a dead deer, Boughner said, not a carcass.   “It did not lose its essence as a deer, an animal, when it died,” he said.   Anderson argued that the statute, which falls under the heading “crimes against sexual morality,” was meant to protect animals. That would be unnecessary in the case of a dead animal.   “If you look at the other crimes that are in this subsection, they all protect against something other than simply things we don’t like or things we find disgusting,” he said.   Other crimes in that subsection include incest, bigamy, public fornication and lewd and lascivious behavior.   Boughner said the focus of the statute was on punishing the human behavior, not protecting animals.   “It does not seem to draw a line between the living and the dead,” he said.   Interpreting the statute to exclude dead animals would also exclude freshly killed animals, Boughner said. That, he said, could lead to people who commit such acts with animals to kill them.   Lucci said he would render a decision by Hathaway’s next court appearance on Dec. 1.   The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of nine months in jail and a fine of up to $10,000. If convicted, Hathaway could serve a prison term of up to two years because of a previous conviction. In April 2005, Hathaway pleaded no contest to one felony charge of mistreatment of an animal for the shooting death of Bambrick, a 26-year-old horse, to have sex with the animal.

Put in for the muzzleloader hunt in 6A. If you get drawn, Ill guarantee you a bull. Those were the words from my friend that began the adventure. I had stopped in to ask my friend Greg McBride what hunts and units I should put in for, in Arizonas fall Big Game draw. Being a fine taxidermist, and an experienced hunter, Greg is a good friend to have. He is also my Number One source for advice, and for the past 2 years, his consultations had become a must. This was my 8th year living in Arizona, but only the 3rd year putting in for the Big Game Draw. So far, I had only been drawn for javelina; I still hadnt filled a tag of any kind. I was hoping that 2005 would be my year!   Twenty years ago, I was prowling around the softwood forests, cedar swamps, and hardwood ridges of New Brunswick, Canada where I was born and raised. I fished, hunted, and ran traplines. My worldly travels had taken me as far as northern Maine, a half hour away. I lived in Maine for about five years, before moving to Arizona. Never in my wildest dreams had I imagined Id be someday hunting elk in far off Arizona. You might as well have told me that Id be stalking keeflongs on the surface of the moon.   One never knows where life will take them however, and Arizona is indeed, where I ended up. Although I had arrived in Arizona in the spring of 1997, I had a delayed start, when it came to experiencing the outdoors. With a new job, a new wife, and ultimately  a new baby  I had really gotten sidetracked. Finally, in 2002, I started getting my feet wet again, so to speak. Not having any hunters at my job, I began to learn the strategies of Arizona hunting on my own. I found some websites, made outdoor friends when I could, and even signed on for a hitch as Assistant Editor of the Arizona Outdoorsman magazine. I had written outdoor columns back east, and had offered my services to the fledgling Arizona publication. I had started dabbling at being a Booking Agent as well  ironically, representing New Brunswick Outfitters at the Outdoor Shows here in the southwest. Ultimately, that is how I met Greg. I was in need of some mounts for my trade show booth, and Greg kindly offered to lend me some of his.   My home is located just east of Phoenix, and due to some logistical issues, I am limited to day trips. Greg knows my situation well, and always provided recommendations for the draw based on Unit distance, draw odds, success rates, etc. As I said, this was my third year entering the big game draw; so far, all I had drawn was javelina tags. I wasnt totally discouraged, as elk tags were getting harder and harder to draw, in Arizona. I was a 2-year veteran in seeing Not Drawn on my applications for antelope, antlered (rifle) deer, bear, elk and turkey. Finally, my 2005 applications were filled out, double- and triple-checked, funds inserted, and mailed in - about a week and a half before the deadline. Then the waiting began. I dont know how it works in other states, but in Arizona, the fall draw (and spring draw, to a lesser extent) is an interesting phenomenon. Its all hunters talk about, from the deadline, to when the results are announced. It is an obsession, really. The websites are buzzing. Hunters are antsy. Arizona Game & Fish adds to the agony by saying the drawing will occur no later than&. No firm date. No mark on the calendar indicating for sure when hunters can either jump for joy, or resign themselves to another year passing them by. When the no later than time period draws near, folks activity reaches the point where it almost frantic. The AZG&F website gets pounded as people check the draw results every 5 minutes. The phone lines get a work out as well, due to the sheer volume of people calling in to see if the results are available. It is indeed, a frenzy.   As the draw deadline drew near, my anticipation began to build, right along with everybody elses. On a particularly slow day at work, I logged on to see if the results were up. For a day or two, there had been a message on the site saying something to the effect that The draw results were being loaded, and would be available soon. When the screen came up, the same old message was still there. About 10 minutes later, I got away from what I was doing, went back to the site, and hit refresh after typing in my ID numbers the screen wobbled, and then it appeared:    Turkey     Not Drawn    Bear     Not Drawn    Elk, Bull    6A Permit #xxxx (ML only)    Mule Deer, Any antlered  24B Permit #xxxx   I blinked at first, kind of like a kid looking at a pile of gifts left by Santa or the Easter Bunny. For a few moments, it just didnt sink in. Gradually, it dawned on me  I had drawn an elk tag, and a deer tag! My first call was to my wife Karole. Now, Karole has always been supportive of my hunting related activities, but admittedly, she doesnt quite get it. She was happy for me, but her reaction was certainly less than animated. I had to call Greg! I called and dang it  he wasnt in. Excitedly, I left a message. Over the weeks and months to follow, he and I would be seeing a lot of each other, as we made plans. Greg asked if he could include a good friend of his, Bruce. Bruce was intimately familiar with my Unit, and was scouting it on a regular basis.   The next several weeks passed quickly in some ways, and agonizingly slow in other ways. Greg regaled me with Bruces reports, every time I stopped in to the taxidermy shop. Excitement was building, for sure. Sleepless nights became the norm. Bruce and Greg were constantly adjusting the plan, and the guarantee of a bull was so far, unscathed. Gregs only caveat was  Ill get you a shot, the shooting is up to you. Shooting was the least of my worries  I had never experienced a problem with my shooting ability. Never had succumbed to buck fever. My worries were on the logistics of the trip  not with making the shot.   As it turns out, Greg and Bruce drew tags for New Mexico. Their hunt started the day after we had planned our elk hunt. The finalized plan was that Greg and I would leave at 2:30 AM, drive north to meet Bruce at daylight, (hopefully) kill an elk, and head back. As I would stop at home, Greg and Bruce would drive all night to New Mexico (silly hunters!). Finally the day arrived, and true to my lifes experiences so far, Murphy was along for the ride. The weekend before, I was doing some final sighting in, with my muzzleloader. That night, while struggling with a stubborn breech plug, I turned the scope in the rings. Wednesday after work, I stopped at the range, and 3 shots confirmed my fears  they were not even on the paper any more. Luckily, I had a Plan B  Greg had been suggesting all along that I use his rifle. A nicer model than mine, and it was dead-on at 200 yards  it looked like I would be using his after all.   Friday morning, I picked Greg up at 2:15 AM. I loaded my gear into his truck, and away we went. The trip to 6A was quick, and uneventful  by 5:30, we had pulled up alongside of Bruces truck. We got out, Greg made the introductions, and we loaded up. Bruce briefed us, we had a game plan, and we ambled across the road, down into the forest. Crisp morning air and the smell of pines was something I hadnt experienced in years. I was nervous, excited, and anxious to see an elk!   We had strolled for less than half an hour when a strong odor wafted across my face. We all looked at each other, and Greg muttered Elk!& I had no idea those creatures would smell so strong. Less than 5 minutes later, Bruce spotted some elk trotting through the trees ahead. We ascertained where they were heading, and trotted ahead, intent on cutting them off. Finally, there they were  about 8 or 10 elk, about 120 yards away. I shed my pack, and Greg and I sprinted up to a suitable firing position. Greg pointed and hissed There  a good bull! Shoot!. I had braced my rifle on a branch. In my scope I saw a bull indeed  but he was quartered away, with 2 cows directly behind him. I waited to see if they would move. Greg was clearly excited  Shoot! I replied that I couldnt. Yes, you can! Shoot. I answered again, that I couldnt. Greg was clearly agitated, as the elk wandered out of sight. That was probably your one shot for the day, he said. After some discussion, we determined that we were looking at 2 different sets of elk. We had barely figured that out, when Bruce was motioning for us that he had spotted more elk. Again, Greg and I were quickly tromping up to a firing point. Frankly, I had been exercising working up to the hunt, but I was not ready for all of this running. An hour into the hunt, and I was getting pooped already. My eyes were taking it in, but my brain was having a hard time processing it. 180 yards across the little pasture in front of me, 50-60 elk were streaming from right to left. It looked like the Serengeti, on a National Geographic special. I found a rest, and picked a bull. He trotted into the opening, but as he stopped, 2 cows pulled up next to him. They then moved ahead, and he was in the clear. I picked a point-of-aim, and squeezed the trigger. BOOM, followed by the cloud of pungent smoke. The elk kept trotting along. Greg and I quickly reloaded as the bull moved over the draw, with the rest of the herd. There was no chance for a second shot. The elk had filed past Bruce, and he hadnt noticed any bulls acting as if they were hit. Greg and I checked the spot where the bull had stood. No hair, no blood. Just tracks and tracks and tracks. I was in disbelief, and was disappointed.   Soon we were chasing another herd through the trees. We got ahead of them, and planned an ambush. Greg pointed to an opening about 120 yards away. They will be going by there he said, get ready. My sight picture was focused on a 3 or 4 foot opening in the trees ahead. As I focused, Greg called it out Cow, cow, calf, calf, calf, cow, spike, cow, cow&bull.. there he is&get ready! As the bull stepped across the opening, I sighted and squeezed  KABOOM  with a belch of fire and smoke. Again, no bull fell. We inspected the spot, and again  found absolutely no sign of a hit. As the day progressed, we put a lot of miles on, and saw a lot of elk. I had packed my pack too full, and was in misery. After bull Number 2, I had relaxed my previous Ill shoot any bull except a spike rule. I was growing concerned, and discouraged. By noon, Bruce had to leave. We had been rained on, snowed on, and hailed on. As the end of the day drew near, we trudged back towards the truck. My mind was racing, I was sore and exhausted, and I was sad beyond words. Worst of all -I had taken shots at 5 different bulls! If we had seen one elk, we had seen 200. Greg stated that it was the most elk he had ever seen in a day of hunting. I was in shock. My dream hunt had turned into a disaster, and I felt guilty for wasting Greg and Bruces time. When I arrived home that night, I was near tears. My socks were a bloody mess. I was exhausted  by my calculations we had walked about 12 miles total that day. I had decided that I would never hunt again. I was disappointed beyond all belief. I had nary a clue of what happened. Over the next few weeks, the self-pity began to recede. I wrote a mini-account on some hunting websites that I participated on. Friends were supportive, and encouraged me to write the full story. It took courage they said, to relate my experiences so that others may learn. We always hear the success stories said one, but never the other stories. Mistakes are the best teachers. Thats why they call it hunting, said another. Weve all had trips like that  most of us never mention them.   Pulling up my boot straps, I analyzed the trip. I decided to make this a giant learning experience, instead of something terrible. Maybe other new elk hunters could learn as well. After a great deal of thought, I came up with the following root causes:   1. Weapon - I shouldn’t have “settled” on the other rifle, especially without shooting it. That is just stupid. I deferred to the experience of my friends, however. Also, as noted - time was a factor, and even finances (ammo) came into play. Regardless, I should have scheduled things in such a way that I had the time to get mine sighted back in, or at least - done some familiarization shooting with my friends rifle.   2. Confidence - Well, in this case, over-confidence. I was so confident that my buddies would get me into elk, that I was overly affected by the whole thing, when it turned sour. From the first missed shot, to the trip in its entirety; over confidence had added fuel to the humiliation and embarrassment. I had bought a freezer, and being a freelance writer - was already thinking of titles for an article. Confidence good; cockiness stupid.   3. Pressure (self)  Arizona hunting hadnt been kind to me. I put a lot of pressure on myself, and 3 seasons without a javelina led to me being even more determined to fill my elk tag. The quest for articles and photographs; not wanting to “let down” my friends and family, you name it. Instead of just relaxing and having fun, I put far too much pressure on myself.    4. Pressure (time) - Having only one day to hunt only added to the pressure. Add to that, my 2 buddies were driving to New Mexico, that night, for a deer hunt. There was a feeling that we needed to get this done, which resulted in rushed shots, or shots I wouldn’t normally take. More available days in the field would have definitely made a difference.   5. Attitude - I have always hunted by myself. Re-playing all of those shots in my head, many of them I would not have taken - either farther than what I was comfortable with, or at walking animals. My buddies were just trying to get me an elk; I think though, that being by myself, I would have chosen shots more carefully, not felt rushed, and probably - been more successful.    6. Fitness - I had been working out (particularly for the mule deer hunt) for about 6 weeks. It was mostly back and leg strength stuff, with some cardio. I was not prepared to run (in order to get ahead of herds). Next time, more cardio.   7. Equipment - I was evaluating a pack on behalf of a national Hunting Magazine (see #3 - pressure ). Thinking I only had a mile or two to go, I had packed it wayyy too heavy. I wore the wrong boots. At some point, my discomfort that day surely added to my lack of marksmanship, and certainly my frame of mind.    In summary, I know “that’s why they call it hunting”, but the experience certainly threw me for a loop. In spite of all the influencing factors I listed above, I still don’t know what REALLY happened that day. I used to teach marksmanship in the military. Like I said, no sniper - but I never would have imagined that not only would I miss once, but FIVE times. I am relieved that they were all clean misses (no animal reaction, no blood, no hair). We did check each time, and had I knowingly wounded an animal, my hunt would have been over. Looking back, it was a great trip. I had seen more elk in a day than some people see in several seasons. I learned a ton about their habits. The air was fresh and crisp, and I enjoyed (sort of) a great day with an old friend and a new one. I learned a new area well. Best of all, I think I hit almost every what not to do possible. I cant wait to draw another tag!

Using modern-day science, they put each myth to the test, separating the real from the really out there. Exploding Toilet Jamie and Adam set out to disprove the legend of the exploding commode. See how Buster, unwitting crash test dummy, manages in a compromised position with gasoline and gunpowder! Next, find out if you stay drier by running – or walking – in the rain. Then, learn the truth behind magic ice bullets, which some say can kill without leaving evidence. Cell Phone Destroys Gas Station The sign at the pump reads, ""No Cell Phones,"" but can this little device really trigger a massive explosion? The MythBusters get their hands on a pair of silicon implants to find out if they'll explode at high-altitude. And, they test the myth that modern CD-ROM drives are so fast, they can actually shatter ordinary compact discs. Barrel of Bricks Jamie and Adam use basic physics to debunk the story of the construction worker who was allegedly buried under 500 pounds of bricks. Find out just how dangerous it is to answer the call of nature on the electrified third rail of a train track and whether or not an eel skin wallet can erase your credit card information. Penny Drop Find out how fast a penny falls when you drop it from the top of the Empire State Building – and whether or not it can be lethal to pedestrians below. Plus, learn if tanning bed customers are getting baked from the inside out and if the fillings in your teeth can really pick up radio signals. Buried Alive Legend has it you can survive a leap from a bridge if you first toss down a hammer to break the plane of the water's surface. Jamie and Adam reveal the ""striking"" truth. Plus, find out how much oxygen there is in a coffin and explore the many sides of cola – from stain remover to steak marinade. Lightning Strikes/Tongue Piercing Did a medieval village in Hungary once build a huge, working cannon entirely out of wood? Join the MythBusters as they try to fashion their own homemade tree cannon and put it to the test. Then, see if Adam's tongue piercing can withstand the electrical force of a lightning bolt and learn what breathalyzers can – and can't – tell the police about you. Stinky Car The story of a used car so rank that it couldn't be resold – it was found with a dead body in it – prompts the guys into replicating the myth as accurately, and legally, as possible. Then, the MythBusters try to discover if they can turn an ordinary household drainpipe into a raccoon rocket launcher. Alcatraz Escape Jamie and Adam retrace the steps of the only prisoners to escape Alcatraz. Could their homemade raft have kept them afloat in the violent San Francisco Bay waters? Learn if an ordinary stud finder can be used to detect victims of mind control experiments and whether or not a duck's quack really echoes. Chicken Gun Did NASA really test the strength of their windshields by firing chickens at them? Find out who wins in the battle of plane versus poultry. Plus, watch as Jamie and Adam go inside the human body to explore the myth of the woman who claimed she swallowed an octopus egg – then gave birth to an eight-legged offspring! Explosive Decompression Jamie and Adam fire a gun into a pressurized jet airliner, attempting to cause ""explosive decompression."" Plus, hear the story of hunters who used a bullet as a replacement fuse in their pickup…with tragic results!  Sinking Titanic Will a sinking ship suck you down as it goes under? The most fun way to find out is to sink a real boat! And, are goldfish bored…or just plain stupid? Breakstep Bridge The MythBusters put on their marching shoes to test the popular military myth that a troupe of soldiers walking across a bridge in perfect time can make the structure collapse. Watch as Stanford University's varsity rowing team attempts to pull Jamie up on water skis and learn how you may be brushing your teeth with bacteria from your toilet.

You                      can always add more, but initially all it takes is a bow,                      a good reel, some bowfishing arrows, polarized glasses, and                      a hat. Different bowfishing situations require different arrow                      and tip designs. Make sure you have enough of the right arrows                      for your bowfishing outing                                             In Arizona we are able to fish for two species with a bow                      & arrow, they are the  Tilapia                       and the  Bigmouth                      Buffalo . In Texas they bowhunt for; Alligator                      Gar - needle nose, spotted, short nose.

Compounds, recurves, long bows use what your comfortable with                      they all work great for bowfishing. Rummage sales are great                      for bowfishing bows I've picked up several for $20.00 a piece.                      You can also check the used bow section at you local archery                      shop or just ask a few friends if they have an old bow or                      if they know of someone who might you'd be surprised.                                           A nice rig for the more serious bowfisherman                      is this pistol crossbow                       that can be purchased for under $100                     REEL:                                                                   The reel is the most important part of bowfishing. To have                      the most fun and to get the most fish you want a reel that                      can quickly handle missed shots and when you do connect with                      a fish, the reel needs to be able to handle the fish as well.                      There are three types of reels. There is the traditional spool                      type reels, the closed face reels and the AMS Retriever Reel.                                           AMS Retriever Bowfishing Reels                                                                   The AMS Retriever Bowfishing Reels  are all                      together different and the reel of choice. There is no bail                      to release, no lost arrows. There is nothing to remember to                      do before each shot. The Retriever reel is mounted to the                      side of the bow in the bow's sight holes. If you choose to                      use sights, a sight can be mounted simply over the top. The                      line of the Retriever is stacked in a plastic bottle rather                      than wound on a spool. When you shoot a fish the line flows                      out of the bottle after your arrow with literally no drag.                      If you miss the fish, just pull the trigger to crank the line                      in. If you hit a smaller fish apply pressure to the trigger                      and crank him in. If he's a real fighter or a larger fish                      there is no adjustable fighting drag, but with a little practice                      you can get him in by pumping your bow. Pull the trigger to                      pinch the line, pull the fish in toward you, and crank up                      the slack line. A couple more times and you've got your fish.                     ARROWS:                     Fiberglass                      arrows work great. They are very strong, take lots of abuse                      from hitting rocks to bending with a flopping fish and they                      spring back in shape for more abuse. There are also aluminum                      clad arrows for extra weight and strength but they are quite                      a bit more expensive.                     SAFETY                      DEVICE FOR ARROWS:                     A                      cable system or similar device is necessary to increase the                      safety of bowfishing. Anytime you tie your line to the tail                      of the arrow and shoot it from a bow, you're asking for trouble.                      Arrow snap back can result. Upon release, there is a trailing                      loop of line that can tangle with the bowstring, the bows'                      cabling, the arrow rest, or the archers wrist watch etc. If                      the line should tangle with any of these objects serious injury                      could result.                     Using                      cable system or AMS's ring sets are the solution to this problem.                      Please refer to  www.amsretriever.com                       for photos of this trailing loop of line, as well as photos                      of the line actually tangling with the bowstring and tying                      itself to the bow's cabling.                     The                      cable system consists of a metal or plastic cable with swivel                      that runs from the tip to the tail of the arrow. It is assembled                      by drilling holes, feeding the cable through, pulling it tight                      and crimping the end clamps,. The line is attached to the                      swivel and slides down the cable when in flight. The swivel                      allows the archer to control the position of the line while                      drawing the bow. By keeping the swivel and bowfishing line                      in front of the bow, there is no longer a trailing loop of                      line nor any obstacle for it to tangle with.                      AMS                      has recently found a more simple solution. A simple stainless                      steel ring with stop screw. The ring slides up and down the                      shaft of the arrow similar to that of the swivel and is stopped                      by a stop screw that is installed in tail of the arrow. The                      function is the same. You tie the line directly to the ring                      and it is able to freely slide up and down the arrow shaft.                      Before drawing just make sure the line and ring is in front                      of the bow no trailing loop of line and no obstacles.                     BOWFISHING                      POINTS:                     Bowfishing                      requires the use of special bowfishing tips. Think of a broadhead.                      They are designed to go through the target and cause lethal                      damage, but thats it. Bowfishing points have barbs that go                      through the fish on the shot – when retrieving they                      hang on to the fish so that you can get him into your boat.                                                                    The                          Muzzy points are very tough and work great for big, hard-sided                          fish. They have a removable tip that can be replaced when                          necessary. The barbs are fixed with a holding area of                          about one inch. To remove a fish with the Muzzy points,                          you need to release the barbs before you can release your                          fish from the arrow. Just twist the tip a couple times                          to release the barbs, turn them back, and pull the arrow                          back through the fish.                                                                                                                                                                               Shure                          Shot points are another tough point. They are another                          compact design also with fixed barbs, but the tip is not                          removable. They offer a little more holding area than                          the Muzzy points, but probably less penetration. The great                          thing about these tips is that a couple twists of the                          arrow shaft will release the barbs and the fish without                          having to touch the tip of the arrow.                                                                                                                                                                               Another                            type of point are the Sting-A-Ree points by Cajun Archery.                            The point is quite long and they are great for smaller                            fish. The barbs are collapsed as the arrow passes through                            the fish. As you pull the arrow back, the barbs catch                            on the side of the fish, open up and hold tight to the                            fish. The holding diameter of these points is nearly                            two inches. As with the Shure shots, a couple twists                            of the arrow shaft will allow the barbs to collapse                            and the fish to be easily removed.                                                                                       POLARIZED                      SUNGLASSES:                     The                      importance of wearing polarized sunglasses while bowfishing                      cannot be emphasized enough. Polarized sunglasses dramatically                      reduce the glare of the sun on the water when bowfishing.                      By reducing the glare, you can see deeper and further out                      into the water. By seeing deeper and further, you can obviously                      see more fish. Clip on's work, but we've found that polarized                      glasses with side shields seem to work better. The best view                      of the fish when bowfishing is with the sun to your back when                      your scanning the water for fish, the side shields offer additional                      protection for your eyes.                     Selecting                      lens color is important. Dark Gray lenses block the most sunlight                      and are used for bright and sunny days. Medium Amber lenses                      are typically used more for overcast and hazy days. Light                      Gray lenses are for used for the first and last light of the                      day.                      **                      Some information on this page was found at  Bowfish                      Iowa.com                        a great resource for bowfishing information.

clueweb09-enwp01-72-02125	"                     Hyper Sports          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                Hyper Sports           Hyper Sports  Title Screen       Developer(s)   Konami       Publisher(s)   Konami       Platform(s)   Arcade ,  Amstrad CPC ,  BBC Micro ,  Commodore 64 ,  MSX ,  ZX Spectrum ,  SG-1000       Release date(s)   1984       Genre(s)   Sports       Mode(s)   Single player , two players simultaneously  Four players total       Input methods   4  buttons       Cabinet   Upright       Sound   Mono       Display   Raster , Horizontal orientation, 256 x 224 resolution       Hyper Sports  is a  video game  published in 1984. It is the sequel to  Konami 's  Track & Field  and features seven all-new  Olympic  events. Like its predecessor,  Hyper Sports  featured two run buttons and one action button per player. This game is also known as  Hyper Olympic '84  outside North America.   While not quite achieving the commercial and critical success of  Track and Field ,  Hyper Sports  still proved to be very popular among gamers and, like its prequel, really came into its own as a highly addictive multi-player experience.     [ edit ]   Gameplay   The gameplay was much the same as  Track & Field  in that the player competes in an event and tries to score the most points based on performance criteria, and also by beating the computer entrants in that event. Also, the player tries to exceed a qualification time, distance or score in order to advance to the next event. In Hyper Sports, if all of the events were passed successfully, the player advances to the next round of the same events which are faster and harder to qualify for.   The events changed to include these new sports:     Freestyle swimming  - Swimming speed is controlled by two run buttons, and breathing is controlled by the action button when prompted by swimmer on screen. There is one re-do if a player fouls due to launching before the gun, but only one ""run"" at the qualifying time.       Skeet shooting  - Selecting left or right shot via the two run buttons while a clay-bird is in the  sight . There are three rounds to attempt to pass the qualifying score. If a perfect score is attained then a different pattern follows allowing for a higher score.       Vaulting horse  - Speed to run at horse is computer controlled, player jumps and pushes off horse via the action button, and rotates as many times as possible via run buttons (and tries to land straight up on feet). There are three attempts at the qualifying score.       Archery  - Firing of the arrow controlled by action button; the elevation angle is controlled by depressing the action button and releasing at the proper time. There are three attempts at passing the qualifying score.       Triple jump  - Speed is controlled by the run buttons, jump and angle are controlled by action button. There are three attempts at the qualifying distance, and player fouls if first jump is after the white line.       Weight lifting  - Power used to lift weights is controlled by run buttons, while shift of weight from lifting up to pushing above the head is controlled by action button. There are two attempts at the qualifying weight.       Pole vault  - Speed to run is preset by computer, while release of pole and body movement is controlled by the action button. Player continues attempting the increasing heights until he/she fouls out (by missing base at the bottom or by knocking off horizontal bar with body at the top). The third foul disqualifies the player.

No, let me back up.. We were notified that our van required an emissions test. I said “That can’t be right - we live in Pinal County”. Well, after some research, I discover that they have extended the “applicable boundaries” to include “parts of Pinal” including the part I live in. Harrumph. My wife is disabled. She doesn’t drive. The van may drive 2 or 3 times a month - either to church or Doctor’s appointments. It is so worn out, we don’t dare take it on extended and/or leisure trips. It doesn’t commute into Maricopa County. I’d be surprised if it drives 5000 miles a year.   So, it failed emissions. I take it ot the mechanic. It’s gonna cost 500-600 bucks, and it  might  pass emissions. EGR thingy is working intermittently. Gonna put a solenoid valve in, de-carb the engine, and add some octane booster. All for a van that rarely moves. I agree with the principle of clean air. I don’t even gripe about testing. What about the thousands of planes that take off and land every day, at Sky Harbor? Or city buses? Or whatever? There should be a “hardship” exception. My wife doesn’t drive. I had to take the van to emissions. Then I had to take it to the mechanic (while juggling vehicles and hitching rides). Then I have to go pick it up. Then take it to get tested. Again. If it fails again, I can get a one-time waiver. But I have to take it to a designated shop in Phoenix. And try to actually hold down a job, somewhere along the way. What a giant crock of fecal matter.   The real irony? I can’t afford 600 bucks any more than most folks. But if I could, there is lots of  legitimate  work that the van needs, that I could have spent it on. That I haven’t. Because I couldn’t afford to. But now, I have to. Because it won’t pass emissions. Geez…                                 Posted on 26th August 2006      Under:  Politics and More  |    1 Comment »                 NOTICE: Hunting ‘Lopes in Alberta This Year?                                  Alberta Sustainable Resource Development   2nd Floor, 9920 - 108 Street  Edmonton Alberta  T5K 2M4   Telephone (780) 422-9534  Fax (780) 427-9557   August 17, 2006   Attention Antelope Hunters;   An error was made in the 2006 antelope hunting season. There is an  overlap of one day between the Archery Antelope season and the Trophy  Antelope season. The Archery Antelope season closes on September 25th  and the Trophy Antelope season opens on September 25th.   Archery hunters routinely use and hide behind male antelope decoys while  hunting antelope. This creates an obvious safety concern when rifle  hunting is occurring concurrently. Please be aware that archery hunters  may be in the field on the opening day of the Trophy Antelope season in  Wildlife Management Units 138,142,144,150,151,152,160,162,163,164, and  166.   Thank you for your attention in this matter.   Bruce Treichel  Wildlife Allocation Specialist                                 Posted on 24th August 2006      Under:  General  |    1 Comment »                 AZGFD Survey causes some consternation                                  Many (if not all) Arizona hunters were recently e-mailed a link to a survey. A LOT of people feel the survey is disingenuous and the questions are leading. Last year, the AZ Deer Association performed a hunter survey, and the Commission/Deprtment basically dismissed the findings. I feel that the current survey only serves to raise the suspicion level found simmering between hunters and AZGFD.   On the other side of the coin, I get disturbed sometimes at how hotly various issues are contested on the message boards, at the club meetings, etc. It seems we (hunters) are unable to reach consensus on  anything . Meanwhile, anti-hunting groups continue to march forward, focused on their goals. The AZGF Commission seems determined not to waiver from their agenda.   The losers, of course - are the hunting community in Arizona.   See some message board discussions :  AZOD    and  CWT                                 Posted on 20th August 2006      Under:  Hunting  |    1 Comment »                 Public help needed in bald eagle shooting                                  Friggin’ a$$h*les   Stuff like this makes my blood boil.   The Arizona Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are asking for help from anyone with information about the shooting death of a bald eagle found in the Doney Park area east of Flagstaff in mid-February.   When the bird was initially recovered, it was difficult to determine the cause of death, but now lab results confirm the eagle was shot.   The bird was discovered near a wooded area on the east side of Caves Crater Hill, just off of Vista de Oro Road, north of Silver Saddle Road. A man walking in the area found the bird and contacted the Arizona Game and Fish Department. The eagle, a 5- to 6-year-old male, was sent to a lab in Wisconsin for testing, where scientists determined how the bird was killed.     Cases like this show a complete disregard for wildlife, and specifically, our national symbol, says Preston Fant, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent in Flagstaff. This shooting is in violation of three federal laws, which can carry fines from $15,000 to $100,000 and six months to one year in prison.     Arizona Game and Fish Department law enforcement staff is working cooperatively with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on this case. If you have any information, please call the Operation Game Thief Hotline at (800)-352-0700. All calls may remain confidential upon request.                                   Posted on 20th August 2006      Under:  General  |    No Comments »                 Dove Season in Sight                                  Early season opens September 1st. I tried my hand at this last year. My daughter loves going too!   AZGF says great season ahead:   September dove season is winging our way  Start loading up on shotgun shells because the Sept. 1-15 early dove season is rapidly winging our way, and it looks like the fast-flying birds will be more concentrated in agricultural areas this year.   Mike Rabe, the departments migratory bird biologist, says that once again this year, hunters can expect Arizona to have the best dove hunting in the nation. Expect mourning and white-winged doves to be more concentrated in agricultural areas than they were last year, he says.   Rabe advises dove hunters to scout beforehand.  Be sure to scout at least a few days ahead of time. Doves are quite dynamic. They will feed heavily in one area, and then all of a sudden, they find another source of food and things change. It also helps to find roost sites.   The juniors-only hunt at the Game and Fish Departments Robbins Butte Wildlife Area near Buckeye is Sept. 2-3, which is the first weekend of the dove hunt.  The juniors hunt is going to be awesome this year. We have lots of birds out here. We expect another record-breaking year, says Phil Smith, the Robbins Butte manager for the Game and Fish Department.   Once again this year, the Chandler Rod and Gun Club will provide a superb pancake and sausage breakfast for all the youth hunt participants at the wildlife area.   Dont forget that juniors in the southern zone can hunt all day, while adults are restricted to half-day (morning) hunting. In the afternoon, a good place to start is around water sources before doves head back to roost in the evening.   Something new for the dove season has been added this year: an open season on Eurasian collared doves. These exotic birds from Europe have gradually worked their way across the United States and can now be found in Arizona.   Eurasian collared doves are typically found in urban areas. Dove hunters shooting at dairies might see them. These are large, steel-gray doves with a black collar around the back of the head. Look for them while hunting. A bag limit of 25 per day is allowed. Be sure to have plenty of shotgun shells in case you find an area where they are abundant   By the way, mark you calendars for Nov. 24-Jan. 7, which is the late dove season. Its typically a lot cooler, but you can still find a lot of hot wing shooting.

The department develops a new strategic plan every six years. The draft document is posted for review on the departments Web site at azgfd.gov. Six public meetings will be held around the state in September to provide an overview. Written comment will be accepted until Oct. 6.   Public input will be important in helping us finalize the plan, says Bruce Taubert, the departments assistant director for wildlife management. Everyone has a stake in the continued health of our states wildlife populations and in future recreational opportunities. Its important to make your viewpoint known.   Wildlife 2012 reflects the management direction the Arizona Game and Fish Commission has provided to the department for the next six years. The plan outlines priorities and strategic goals in four areas: wildlife management, off-highway vehicle recreation, watercraft recreation and department administration.   Public meetings about Wildlife 2012 will include a presentation on the planning process and an overview of the plans highlights. The meetings will be held from 6-9 p.m. on the following dates:   Wednesday, Sept. 6  Yuma, Arizona Game and Fish Department Yuma regional office, 9140 E. 28th St.  Monday, Sept. 11  Kingman, Arizona Game and Fish Department Kingman regional office, 5325 N.

This will be a story of life, death, sacrifices and donations; all of which add up to a gift from the heart.   Tina Pattison had a son, this son was just as you would think; active, fun loving, and very active in hunting and fishing. If you were to visit the HOAL website  http://www.huntofalifetime.org/   you would see that Matt wasnt only a young man that lived to hunt, he was also a young man that loved to pass the heritage on. Matt was stricken with a terminal illness at the age of 18, something all mothers and fathers fear the most. Matt had a dream to hunt, and that dream was to hunt a moose.   If we all look back we can remember a group that catered to kids who were very ill. This group would grant a wish to these children so that they could realize their dream; this group was called The Make a Wish Foundation. The Make a Wish Foundation is an awesome group and I wouldnt want to take anything away from what they do, however, another group, one that I do not look on as a good group let the Make a Wish Foundation know that they were against the hunting part of The Make a Wish Foundation and hearing this The Make a Wish Foundation buckled to the pressure that this worthless organization was causing. This group is only mentioned on the HOAL site as an anti-hunting group but I bet we all can guess who was behind the pressure that forced the decision of The Make a Wish Foundation.   Tina, and her husband, Chester did not give up on a hunt of a lifetime for Matt, in fact they began to solicit help from hunting groups all over the United States and these groups responded as hunting groups always do when it comes to helping fellow huntersthey literally put their money and time into something they believed in and that was to help Matt find a way to get that moose he wanted. I would tell you which groups but instead I would rather all of you go to the website and see what this group is doing for kids just like Matt. You can also read about some of the recent and past youngsters that were helped by the Hunt of a Lifetime.    The great news is Matt got his moose, the bad news is that Matt lost his battle to cancer and left a huge hole in his parents heart, a hole that is being filled one hunt at a time through generous donations and time from complete strangers, strangers, who like us, are hunters and fisherman and parents to kids of our own.  You can never close that hole in your heart and maybe we are not supposed to, but, there can be a way to make the hole smaller and The Hunt of a Lifetime Organization is doing this for Tina, and Chester along with many other family members who are faced with the cold fact that cancer and other deceases do not discriminate between age, race, or religion.      Here in Arizona we have some of the most generous people in the world. This state always fascinates me when it comes to helping others and in the case of the Hunt of a Lifetime it was no different! Not only did we have guides to help these kids we have people who donate money for hotel rooms, companys like Cabelas, Gander Mountain, Mossy Oak and others who donate gear and guns, and anything else that is needed to make this the best experience that it can be for the kids. Huge groups like the NRA and the Safari Club International are there for anything that is needed too. As you can see, there are tons of groups and companies that are at the ready to do the right thing for these people and these kids.    Getting back to Arizona, last year I was lucky enough to find out about The Hunt of a Lifetime through a website that I frequent. There was this young lady that was asking for help from any guides in Arizona that could help with a hunt for The Hunt of a Lifetime. This young lady did her part to capture these hunts on videos so that the kids and the parents would have these memories forever on film. The young lady is no other than Stephanie Rainey who is on the Arizona committee. Stephanie has her own business that allows her to video these hunts, and at the same time she fulfills her desire to do something good for someone else. Stephanie isnt alone in her desire to help these families, no, there are many more.   The Ambassador to Arizona is a man by the name of Terry Petko. Terry is always working to find guides, sponsorship, and donations in Arizona. I can honestly say that Terry must be doing a great job because there were some very happy hunters last year in Arizona.   The first young man that The Hunt of a Lifetime assisted in living his dream here in Arizona was young man who was diagnosed with bone cancer, luckily he has been in remission for a year and he is doing well. The way that this young man received his tag is a story all of itself and I feel it necessary to tell this story.    Arizona has had some living legends in the hunting world and last year we lost one of those living legends in a tragic second. Norm Pint has been in Arizona as long as I can remember and I have been here a while. Norm had many interests and one of them was hunting, and teaching hunting to anyone who wanted to learn. It was on one of his beloved hunting trips that Norm lost control of his truck and lost his life. He will be missed by anyone and everyone that knew him.   Norm had been putting in for bighorn sheep in Arizona for ever and last year, 2005, was his year to be drawn for that elusive tag. Norm was number one out of two tags that were selected to hunt in a unit near Kingman, Arizona. This tag was donated to the Hunt of a Lifetime by the family of Norm Pint. The Pint family was still heavy into the grieving process when they decided to make this happen for young Christopher Reeves.   Christopher is like all 16 year old kids that like to hunt. He is ambitious and excitable and he very much wanted to shoot a nice ram. This trip has many heroes and they all need to be mentioned here but because of space I will write about a few.    There is a man named Don Martin who lives in Kingman. Don owns an outfitting company that goes by the name of Arizona Wildlife Outfitters. Don has some great guides that work with him and it was one of these guides, Larry Sallee, along with Bill Luffy of the Arizona Bighorn Sheep Society that showed Christopher his seven and half year old ram!    As usual the shot was anti climatic in comparison with what was happening all around Christopher, people were literally giddy that he shot the ram and they could not have been more proud to be a part of such a grand event!!    Christopher is the young man directly behind the rams horns with the camouflage shirt and hat on. There are many people to say thank you to in this story and here are a few:  Many thanks to Terry Petko, with Hunt of a Lifetime, Pat Feldt, with Arizona Guided Hunts, Arizona Desert Bighorn Sheep Society (Dave Pence, Ignacio Beltran, Bill Luffy, Jim Unmacht, Jimmy Unmacht) and all the others on the team (including AWO guides Larry Sallee, Dan Reed, and Kevin Ridgers) who made this young man’s dream become a reality!   As you all can see by the smile on Christophers face, and the rest of the smiles, this stuff is worth every second that we can spend on it. Life is full of bad news but in this case there is nothing but good news to report and write about. Bighorns are what we dream of hunting as hunters but another awesome creature we have here in Arizona is the Wapiti, or, Elk, and for another young man it was what he dreamed of hunting and The Hunt of a Lifetime was right there to make it happen.   17-year-old Karl Hoidal, who was diagnosed with Hodgen’s Lymphoma at the age of 15, was the next lucky young man to be bestowed the honor to hunt with a couple of the best guides we have. This father and son guide team of Randy and Josh Epperson own their own outfitting company called Rimrock Outfitters. The two of them are known for the excellent mountain lion hunts and they are both awesome elk guides as well. I spoke with Josh about this hunt and he said that young Karl was all pumped up to hunt and just wanted to shoot a nice bull elk, and that is exactly what he did. Josh told me that Karl made a perfect 440 yard shot on his bull that was taken just north of Payson. Karl and the Eppersons were being filmed through out the hunt by Stephanie Rainey and now the hunt will be on film for ever.   In the world of hunting there always seems to be a battle. We battle antis all the time just so we can keep doing what we love to do, we battle our finances to make the next trip, or we battle our boss to let us off so we can go hunting. Doesnt all that seem small after reading about these kids?    There is a song that plays on the radio once in a while that says something about Live like you were dying you know what, I understand this song and that is why we all have to help these kids realize their dreams. I would encourage all of you readers to visit the Hunt of a Lifetime website and see for yourself the great things that Tina and her husband are doing for these kids. You need to support the stores that help people like this and make sure you drop a line to Tina and tell her how you feel about the group she formed through the power of love.   For more information about The Hunt of a Lifetime organization you can go to  http://www.huntofalifetime.org/   and see for yourself. If you are interested in helping this group you can find links that will help you find the correct way to donate your time, money, or anything else that will assist in the future of this group.    If you are a guide here in Arizona and you would like to donate your time and services you should contact Terry Petko (602) 689-9524 or email him at t.petko@cableaz.com    The world of hunting is made up of some of the best people that have ever walked the earth. There are so many people involved with this group that I would have to dedicate several pages to give them accolades. I hope you all take the time and see for yourself what helping The Hunt of a Lifetime can do for some of these kidsyou will never, ever regret it.                                   Posted on 20th August 2006      Under:  Arizona News  |    No Comments »                 Increased Spring Opportunities                                  From AZGFD   Spring hunt recommendations should increase hunter opportunities  A record number of spring turkey tags and an increase in javelina tags are being recommended by the Arizona Game and Fish Department this year, which should provide more people an opportunity to go hunting.   Game Chief Leonard Ordway says the spring hunt recommendations reflect the Arizona Game and Fish Commissions direction to enhance hunter opportunities and reduce barriers to hunter retention, while maintaining sustainable big game populations.    Recommended tag numbers reflect current biological conditions and will allow more people a chance to hunt, he says.   The departments spring hunt recommendations will be considered by the Game and Fish Commission during its meeting in Flagstaff on Aug. 11-12 at the Radisson Woodlands Hotel at 1175 W. Route 66, starting at 8 a.m. both days. The commission will address the spring hunting seasons during the Saturday portion of the two-day agenda.  The entire agenda meeting is available here.   The department is recommending 6,246 spring turkey tags, which is a 670-permit increase from the 2006 season.     Last year was a good year for turkey reproduction. The hunt success was high. The turkey populations are doing well. Those factors combined with having stratified hunts provide us the opportunity to recommend a record hunt-permit number for spring turkey, says Brian Wakeling, the departments big game program biologist.   The department is also recommending a 225-permit juniors-only season to begin one week earlier than the standard seasons and run for five weeks. That would be April 20-May 24, using a similar structure to last year. Juniors-only permits are recommended for a 60-permit increase over last year, with the overall junior hunt opportunity distributed across the state.   For javelina, the department is recommending 11,480 permits for the general javelina season; 865 permits for the juniors-only season; 5,465 permits for the handgun, archery and muzzleloader season (HAM); and 9,200 permits for the archery season.   When considered together with the fall javelina hunts being conducted for the first time ever this year, this results in an overall recommendation for an increase of approximately 1,100 javelina permits compared to the last javelina season.                                   Posted on 9th August 2006      Under:  Arizona News  |    1 Comment »                 AZSFW & Landowner Tags                                  A statement from Pete and Ron….   Who says AZSFW is for Landowner Tags?   By Pete Cimellaro and Ron Eichelberger    At no time have Ron Eichelberger or myself been an advocate for landowner tags.  We have never seen a landowner tag system that could work here in Arizona.   To begin this story you have to go back to the 1980s when elk numbers were high and conflict was raging between the Cattlemen, US Forest Service, AZ Game & Fish Department, and Sportsmen.  The politics were just plain nasty, with everyone distrusting one another and working against any meaningful resolution of the problem.     During this time we regularly faced legislation to establish some kind of landowner tag program.  Sportsmen and the department would beat it down in the legislature and the very next year we would be back doing the same thing, with nothing resolved.   In the early 1990s, then, Speaker of the House Mark Kilian, established the Natural Resource Discussion Group at the Legislature.  This group, made up of cattlemen, legislators, environmentalists, game & fish, sportsmen, etc., discussed many issues of conflict in an effort to find workable solutions.   While no monumental solutions were found, better dialogue did take place and some trust was built between the stakeholders.  This process lasted through several House Speakers, but eventually stopped.   After the Natural Resource Discussion Group ended, the conversations and discussion among former members continued.  Most notably, discussions continued between the Cattleman and Sportsmen.  Most of the talk was about resolving the cattle vs. elk issue, access issues and about our mutual enemies.   The most notable players were: Doc Lane, Bass Aja, Chas Erickson, Steve Smith, Benny Aja and others representing the cowboys, while Floyd Green, Hays Gilstrap, Chris Denham, Nancy Lewis, Ron Eichelberger, Suzanne Gilstrap and Pete Cimellaro represented the hunters.  I have left out plenty of folks on both sides of this issue; some because they attended only a few meetings and many because I have simply forgot all of the names.  This is a symptom of my advanced age and is only going to get worse.   One positive event that did take place was the Governors Elk Symposium in 2001.  We brought together a lot of interested parties, met with the experts, and had some good discussion of the conflicts between elk, cattle and the people that support each of them.  The negative crowd was there too, saying the symposium was only a platform for landowner tags.  But, once again, there were no monumental revelations or life changing solutions offered up, and no landowner tags either, just good dialogue and a willingness to continue talking.   Some of us have continued to attend each others meetings and argue the issues, never coming to any consensus or finding a solution.  We have agreed to continue dialogue on these issues and will continue to do so because it is the responsible thing to do.  None of us have a lock on the use of our public lands and whenever possible multiple users must respect the needs of all stakeholders.   More importantly we must continue to have open dialogue on these important issues.   During 2005 the next chapter in this ongoing saga unfolded and you might have already guessed that Ron and I are right in the middle of it.   Because of our involvement with Arizona Sportsmen for Wildlife (AZSFW) we have been tabbed by an unknowing, or worse yet, malicious few, as wanting to bring landowner tags to Arizona.  I assume this is because in some states Sportsmen for Wildlife (SFW) has been behind landowner tags and much of their influence hinges on the money raised by these tags.   The difference here is that we have started AZSFW, not SFW.  We have our own separate corporation and organization.  We did this because we wanted to be autonomous to a great degree while still working with SFW chapters on national issues.  Up front, we told SFW that landowner tags in Arizona wouldnt fly and that we would continue to help lead the opposition of any landowner tag program.  They are and we are fine with this arrangement!  Below is an excerpt from the AZSFW policy and issues statement.   Oppose any legislation or rule that allows for the creation of landowner tags for big game, while endeavoring to identify ways to address legitimate landowner depredation issues.   This statement goes right to the heart of the issue.   No, on landowner tags but lets keep talking about our issues.   This is where Ron and I have been from the start and where AZSFW is now.  We challenge anyone to provide any evidence to the contrary!   One other perceived conflict we would like to address is the laughable charge that Ron and I, because we are outfitters, want landowner tags.   No one has been more vocal in their opposition to USO (George Taulman) than Ron and me.  We have been vocal to the point we have alienated some Arizona outfitters.  Tough!  What is most important is that wildlife thrives here in Arizona.  In order for that to happen we need a solid hunting base.  This base must be built upon resident hunters (you and your kids), not nonresidents who come and go.  While I appreciate nonresident contributions, they alone cannot sustain our wildlife programs; that burden lies squarely on the residents.   If we have a solid resident hunter pool, volunteer interest, additional fundraising and political involvement, then maybe wildlife has a chance.  Without these elements, we all know the future for wildlife is bleak.   To put an exclamation point on this issue:  Who was the lead in this years passage of HB 2127 (the legislation that insures at least 90% of Arizonas big game tags will go to its residents)?  You guessed it, AZSFW.  It makes absolutely no sense for Ron and I, or AZSFW, to support HB 2127, if what we really wanted was landowner tags or unlimited nonresident hunting opportunities.   In closing, please judge us on our fifty years of sportsmen conservation work.  Do not listen to the voices of a questionable few, with unknown motives, to make your judgment.  Judge AZSFW by the people who stand before you to promote it, and by what it does, not by what a few say it will do!

More than 9,000 javelina tags, 250 turkey tags, and 70 bear tags remained  after the spring big game draw process was completed. The department began  accepting applications by mail only on Dec. 1.   For an updated list of leftover permits, along with regulations,  applications, and instructions on how to apply, visit  www.azgfd.gov/draw .   For those who qualify, there are military hunts available for Fort Huachuca.  Call (520) 533-2549 for additional information.   Nearly all hunt types are available for javelina, including juniors-only,  general, HAM (handgun, archery, and muzzleloader), and archery-only. The  available turkey tags are for general hunts; the available bear tags are for  archery-only hunts.   A 2009 hunting license is required to apply for a permit-tag. Licenses can be  purchased from an Arizona Game and Fish Department office or authorized license  dealer, or you can apply for one by mail in conjunction with your tag  application. When applying for a license via the tag application, be certain  that all required information and additional payment fees are correct and  enclosed. In addition, youth hunters ages 10-13 are required to have completed a  certified hunter education course to hunt big game.   Each of these animals make excellent table fare, not to mention the great  experience you gain when hunting these wild creatures.

If used incorrectly or in the wrong situation, predator calls will prove worthless. In fact, it will scare the Javelina herd away 99.9 percent of the time. Despite predator calling limitations, it's without a doubt the most exciting way to hunt Javelina. Using a predator call exploits the Javelina's propensity to counter attack predators and come to aid wounded or distressed herd mates.

She killed her with a PSE crossbow at 15 yards in Ohio late October 2008 and it weighed in at 125 dressed. Later on a youth gun hunt, she took her 1st buck, a nice 7 point weighing about 125 also.                                                                                                                                          .                    . .

I saw the arrow go through the animals body and knew it was a good solid hit the minute I released.  Most bow hunters have the feel of a good shot or of a bad one, you just know if the arrow was released properly and you know if your form was good as well.

BAM!  (With my regards to Emeril Lagasse)   My new friend Denny Corriveau is a fellow  POMA  member, and a New Englandah to boot. A New Englander with Arizona connections, mind you - having lived here for awhile…  Anyway, I just received this from Denny:   WildCheff Background   For years I have cooked with combination of herbs that have helped me to create wild game dishes that have been featured at deer camps, game dinners and private catering events that feature wild game.    I teamed with a colleague and food industry award winning expert to create gourmet, hand-crafted spice and sausage blends that are compelling  one smell, one taste and sportsmen are generally hooked! They have a common sense approach, and these blends are sure to elevate sportsmen and game enthusiasts cooking abilities to a whole new exciting level they never previously realized were possible.   Im not sure if you are like me, but I have observed many sportsmen over the years spend 99% of their time focused on how to create a successful hunt, but have virtually ignored any concentration on how to properly prepare their harvest so it can be enjoyed to its fullest potential. It is my goal to create a more defined passion within sportsmen for cooking their game; on a personal, organizational, and national basis through education, inspiration and my product line.    WildCheff products not only provide direction, but help outdoorsmen to develop a comfort level with advancing their wild game cooking skills; by combining herb blends that are realistic, coupled by cooking styles that most people are familiar with and can relate to.  The days of canned soup and pouring salad dressing over your game are now a thing of the past due to my products, and I hope to inspire and help hunters and game enthusiasts to develop a new mindset concerning their desire to cook and share their game in a way that become natural to them.   As a courtesy, I have put together a straight-forward online presentation (5-6 minutes in length/great excuse for a coffee break) that will provide you with an overview on my products, as well as a live link to my website.   Enjoy my presentation and much success to you in your outdoor endeavors.   You have been invited to view a presentation titled “ Cooking Your Wild Game More Effectively “.

Posted on 29th May 2008      Under:  General  |    No Comments »                 New Requirements For AZ Bowhunters                                  From AZGFD:   Archery deer hunters: Be aware of new permit requirements   Some popular hunting units no longer open to over-the-counter tag holders   Archery deer hunters are advised that some game management units formerly open to over-the-counter archery permit-tags will now require a permit issued through the big game draw application process for the 2008-09 hunting season.   Pursuant to the Arizona Game and Fish Commission hunt orders approved on April 19, 2008, archery deer hunts in the following units are now allocated through the big game draw:   "" 1  White Mountains / Big Lake area  "" 3A and 3C  Heber-Overgaard, Show Low, Snowflake and Holbrook areas  "" 7  Areas north and west of Flagstaff  "" 12A  North Kaibab  "" 12B  North Kaibab  "" 12B West  North Kaibab  "" 13A  Arizona Strip  "" 13B  Arizona Strip    Archery hunters interested in hunting deer in these units will need to apply through the big game draw application process. The deadline to apply is June 10 by 7 p.m. (MST)  postmarks do not count. Applications will be accepted by mail or may be hand delivered to a department office  there is no online application process.    The reason for this significant first-ever change is to allocate the harvest among deer hunters that is proportionate to the demand for that weapon choice.  In some management units, the harvest proportion for certain weapon types exceeded the demand, states Brian Wakeling, big game management supervisor for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.   Under the new formula, in game management units where there is a single archery season and if the archery harvest exceeds 20-percent of the combined total harvest by both firearms and archery hunters, the commission established the need to allocate archery tags through the big game draw process to keep harvest by weapon type proportionate with demand, Wakeling added.   Hunters who purchased a 2008 archery season nonpermit-tag in the fall of 2007 are reminded that you are now required to adhere to the new 2008-09 hunting regulations, which will eliminate these units from your available hunting areas (although these tags are valid in many other open units). Hunters are also advised that some season structures (dates) have changed, which includes the lengthening of seasons in some units.   To download a copy of the 2008-09 Arizona Hunting and Trapping Regulations and to learn how to apply through the draw process, visit  www.azgfd.gov/draw . If you have additional questions, call your local department office.   Archery deer hunters should adhere to the following guidelines regarding harvest reporting:    Nonpermit-tag holders: Mandatory harvest reporting is still required by archery deer hunters with an over-the-counter nonpermit-tag. Please call (866) 903-3337.   Permit-tag holders: Archery deer hunters with hunt permit-tags obtained through the draw process are NOT required to call the harvest hotline. However, you will receive a hunter questionnaire in the mail. Please return your questionnaire.    Regardless of hunt permit-tag type, all successful archery hunters are encouraged to participate in the voluntary chronic wasting disease (CWD) sampling program. Hunters who are successful in Game Management Unit 12B are especially encouraged to submit heads. Because this unit borders Utah, deer from this area of the state have the greatest potential for initial detection of CWD. To submit a sample, heads can be brought to any Game and Fish Department office between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. You will be notified of the results of this test and there is no charge for this service. Lab tests from the sampling during the 2007-08 season found no presence the disease in Arizona.                                   Posted on 29th May 2008      Under:  General  |    No Comments »                 Please Don’t Pick Up Babies                                  There isn’t a single one of us who doesn’t “ooooo” or “ahhhh” over little baby critters. That being said, picking up little ones can do more harm than good. From AZGFD:   Don’t pick up baby birds and other young wildlife   Good intentions can do more harm than good   You may be tempted to pick up a baby bird or other young wild animal that appears to be on its own, but Arizona Game and Fish Department biologists warn this is not a good idea.    This is the time of year young wildlife can be seen throughout the state, and the department typically receives an increased number of calls and visits from good Samaritans who are trying to do the right thing by “rescuing” baby animals thought to be abandoned.    That can cause more harm than good.   “If you see a baby bird, rabbit, fawn or any young animal on its own, don’t assume it’s orphaned and in need of your help,” says Randy Babb, information and education program manager for the departments Mesa region. “Usually, the parents are not far away. They may be out gathering food, taking a short break from their young, or you may have scared them away. If you remove the baby, then its odds for survival diminish.”   For example, baby rabbits, if removed from the wild, will almost certainly die. Newborn rabbits require virtually 24-hour care for any hope of survival, but even then the odds are slim.   Young birds on the ground may be learning to fly or may have fallen from a nest. Birds that have fallen from a nest will not be neglected; the parents will continue to care for them. However, if the young birds are in immediate danger, it is OK to place them back in the nest. Contrary to popular belief, human scent will not concern the avian parents.   Moving deer and antelope fawns and elk calves is not only bad for the animal, it is also illegal.  Regulations prohibit possessing and moving native deer and elk due to concerns over the potential transmission of chronic wasting disease (CWD) to Arizonas deer and elk populations. CWD, a wildlife disease fatal to deer and elk, has not yet been found in Arizona but is in several neighboring states.    The best rule of thumb if you see young wildlife on its own is to resist the instinct to help, and leave the animal alone.  Humans are often the threat that scares away the adult, so the sooner you vacate the area, the quicker the parent will return to care for its young.   There is almost never an occasion when you should remove a baby wild animal from its natural environment, as that may doom it from being able to survive in the wild in the future says Babb. However, on those rare occasions where a young animal is obviously injured, you should call a wildlife rehabilitator who can assess the animal and decide whether to move it.   The Arizona Game and Fish Department has a list of wildlife rehabilitators and their phone numbers available at the department’s Web site at  www.azgfd.gov/urbanwildlife . This section of the department’s Web site also contains details about how to deal with truly injured, sick or orphaned wildlife.   If the injured animal is a large game animal or potential danger to handlers, such as a deer, javelina or coyote, call the closest Arizona Game and Fish Department office or Radio Dispatch at (623) 236-7201.

Posted on 28th May 2008      Under:  Press Releases  |    No Comments »                 SCI Files Suit                                  For Immediate Release  May 27, 2008    SCI Files Lawsuit to Reverse Ban on Polar Bear Imports   Washington, D.C. — On May 23, 2008, Safari Club International (SCI) filed a federal lawsuit challenging the ban on the import of polar bear trophies from Canada. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) claims the import ban was required when the Service listed the polar bear as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). SCIs lawsuit asks the Court to confirm the right under current law of U.S. hunters to import polar bear trophies into the United States under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).    Sustainable sport-hunting of polar bears and subsequent importation by U.S. citizens advances polar bear conservation and supports remote native communities in the Canadian arctic.    Dennis Anderson, President of SCI, said, Fourteen years ago Congress determined that permitting the importation of sport-hunted polar bear trophies from Canada promoted conservation. Congress built safeguards into the Marine Mammal Protection Act to protect the species. For an import to be permitted, the animal must have been hunted from an approved population, meaning that the FWS has found that the hunting is sustainable.   This finding ensures sound management of polar bear populations. The FWSs recent listing of the species as threatened  — based on reports that attempt to predict speculative impacts 45 years from now  — should not be used to undermine Congress plan to support polar bear conservation.   SCIs lawsuit explains that the MMPA specifically provides for the import of sport-hunted polar bears from approved populations. The threatened listing does not change this authorization. In fact, the ESA itself allows for the continued importation of sport-hunted polar bears, even if they are listed as threatened.    SCI expects to prove to the federal court for the District of Columbia that the Services position is wrong. The import ban in the MMPA applicable to depleted species does not override the specific authorization of polar bear imports. In addition, the Service has not made the requisite findings necessary to even arguably trigger this import ban.      The groups that petitioned the Service to list the polar bear under the ESA have admitted that their ultimate goal is to change U.S. climate policy. SCI President Anderson said, Sustainable hunting that benefits the conservation of the polar bear, and helps the local people who must live with the polar bears, should not be a casualty of this abuse of the ESA.   Contact:  Nelson Freeman  Governmental Affairs  and Public Relations  Safari Club International  nfreeman@safariclub.org                                 Posted on 28th May 2008      Under:  Press Releases  |    No Comments »                 Be Bear Aware                                  From AZGFD:   Camping season is here: Be bear aware   Prime camping season is arriving in the high country, and the Arizona Game and Fish Department reminds people heading to the great outdoors to be bear aware and keep a clean campsite.   Bear activity is up this time of year, as yearling bears leave their mothers and begin roaming more in search of food sources and to establish their own territories. Bears have a keen sense of smell and can be drawn to food in campgrounds.   The root cause of most conflicts between bears and people, especially in camping areas, is food, says Bruce Sitko, information and education program manager in Game and Fishs Pinetop region. Bears cant change their behavior, but people can. Protect yourself and protect a beartake a few minutes to secure your food items.   Wildlife officials say it is prudent for all outdoor recreationists to take the following precautions to minimize potential conflicts with bears and other wildlife:   Never intentionally feed wildlife.  Secure all garbage.  Keep a clean camp.  Do not cook in your tent or sleeping area.  Store all food, toiletries and other scented items well away from sleeping areas and unavailable to bears.  Wash up, change clothing, and remove all scented articles before retiring to your sleeping area.  Walk or jog in groups. Pay attention to your surroundings when hiking, jogging or bicycling.  Supervise your children and keep them in sight.  Keep your pets on a leashdont allow them to roam free. Or better yet, leave them at home if you can. Pets can easily get into conflicts with a wide range of wildlife.  If you are confronted by a black bear (the only bear species in Arizona), dont run. Stay calm, continue facing it, and slowly back away. Try to make yourself look as big and imposing as possible; put young children on your shoulders. Speak or yell and let it know you are human. Make loud noises by clanging pans, using air horns, or whatever is available.   If you encounter a bear in a developed campground, notify the campground host. If you have a problem with a scavenging bear in the forest, notify the Arizona Game and Fish Department.   For more information, visit  www.azgfd.gov/urbanwildlife .

The trip started with a one-way ticket to Little Rock, Arkansas and included visits to some of the top aquaculture companies and facilities in the world.  Swanson witnessed the gathering up of over 15,000 pounds of catfish from a 20-acre pond, the sorting process to remove all smaller catfish, and the loading and weighing out of up to 500 pounds of fish into each of 35 tanks on two hauling trucks.  Hard work, organization and professionalism were evident by all people responsible for the raising, handling and hauling of the catfish.  The fish tanks were flushed with cool, clean water and salt and ice was added to make the journey more comfortable and safe for the fish.  Swanson rode with Mr. Fish owner/operator Roger Coffman in one of two large bob trucks the entire 1600 mile, 34 hour non-stop journey to Arizona.  The catfish were checked and monitored throughout the journey and treated with the best of care to ensure they stayed cool and calm and were given ample oxygen.  On Friday, May 16 all but 2 of the 8,600 strong, healthy catfish had survived the marathon journey and were ready for a 12-hour day of stocking into 19 lakes.  I know without a doubt that Mr. Fish is one of the best, if not the best, fish hauler and transporter in America.  We are fortunate to have a long-term contract with them to deliver catfish and sunfish to our Urban Fishing waters for many years to come, boasted Swanson.   May 26-31 catfish stocking status and lake monitoring  All urban lakes will be stocked with catfish the week of May 26-31, with the exception of Water Ranch Lake in Gilbert (see golden alga article below).  Cool, favorable weather last week helped to slow biological activity that elevates lake pH levels.  Biologists will continue to monitor lake water quality every two weeks to ensure conditions are suitable for catfish stockings.  If pH levels exceed 9.5 or golden alga blooms occur, biologists will not stock a lake and will instead reroute the fish to other, nearby urban waters.   Golden alga flares up at Water Ranch Lake  no fish stocking   On Friday, May 24 anglers at Gilberts Water Ranch Lake began noticing odd behaviors in fish and a few dead ones.  Catfish were observed swimming slowly in the shallows oblivious to human activity.  The Town of Gilberts lake management consultant had the lake tested for golden alga and the results were positive.  The timing over the holiday weekend caused an unfortunate delay in the algaecide treatment of the lake leading to higher fish mortalities.  Water Ranch Lake will be aggressively treated May 26-27 to control the problem golden alga before it can take out more fish.  Recent water quality tests for conductivity and alkalinity showed that Water Ranch Lake had higher values than most other lakes, making it more susceptible to golden alga blooms and fish kills, but also explaining why the golden alga problem here is worse than any of the other five affected lakes.  Biologists and lake managers are working to put a stop to the reoccurring algae blooms and fish kills, and are determined to win this battle.  There will be no catfish stockings the week of May 26-31, or until the golden alga can be brought back under control and further tests are negative.   Urban fishing report  Fishing for catfish continues to be good to excellent the week of stocking.  The top bait for the 14-20 inch channel catfish are stink baits fished on the bottom.  Other baits such as shrimp and worms have worked well.  Anglers are catching good numbers of sunfish on small worms or mealworms.  Cats have been biting best mid morning and in the evenings.  Recent stockings have included some big catfish in the 3-5 pound range.  At Green Valley lakes (Payson) fishing is good for trout with most fish biting bait such as worms or PowerBait.  Bluegill, crappie and bass are biting well on small jigs and worms fished under a bobber at Green Valley.    Stocking updates :   Phoenix Area Lakes  - May 16 stocked catfish. Next stocking, catfish the week of May 26-31.   Tucson Area Lakes  - May 16 stocked catfish. Next stocking, catfish the week of May 26-31.   Green Valley Lakes (Payson)  - May 9 stocked trout (double stocking, last of season) No further trout stockings until mid October.

Anyway, Amanda just helped with some deer research and made a very cool thread about it on her message board. You can read the full thread and view photos  HERE .   A snippet of the thread:   Hi All,   Yesterday I spent the day helping on a research project that is partially funded by the AZ Deer Association. Many of you are familiar with the three-bar enclosure. Deer within the enclosure have been the subject of much study. Well, those mule deer reached a density of 87 deer in that square mile and the AGFD finally decided they wanted to let them out so the fence was put down. Some of you may remember that last year I helped out with deer drive to push the deer out of the enclosure. Well, anyway, there are still many radio collared deer out there and there is still research going on even though the deer are outside the enclosure now. Jim deVos (who recently retired from AGFD as the head of the research branch), the AGFD, Texas Tech University (Dr. Warren Ballard and Dr. Mark Wallace and grad students) and the AZ Deer Association have partnered up to do a study of fawn survival on those deer. Starting last spring, several does were captured and a radio transmitter was put in their reproductive tract such that when they gave birth to their fawns, the transmitter comes out and let’s researchers know that fawns are on the ground to be found. Then the fawns are collared and studied to determine survival (or lack their of and causes of death). Last year only 2 of 20 fawns survived. This year they are capturing about 25 does and doing it all over again. Yesterday was the day for capture, checking for pregnancy and inserting the transmitter. We captured and processed about 18 does yesterday. I think all were pregnant and most had twins.   Deer are captured by a net shot over them from a helicopter. Then the deer have their legs tied together and they are transported to the workup area where we had two vets, grad students, professors and such there to work them up. It was definitely a traumatic day for these deer. But I guess they are tough enough to go through all this and still maintain their pregnancy. I don’t know the time between capture and getting them to us, but we averaged about 9-10 mins of working on them once they were dropped off. Primarily I helped out by spraying the deer down with cold water to keep them cool. This was a challenge as there is a narrow range of temperature where the deer are safe. If they get over 105, everyone gets worried. Most of the deer came in at 103-104 and their temps were climbing. By the time we cooled them down and released them they were at 101-103. One deer required cool intravenous fluids and packing with ice to bring her temp down fast and keep her safe. Any wounds from capture were treated as needed. Mostly they were abrasions, but some cut their lips or nose or foot bad enough to need stitches.                                 Posted on 27th May 2008      Under: "

The                management shift in Arizona to create more hunting opportunities                and to remove existing barriers to participation ties back to a                report from the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies                in 2004, outlining efforts by state wildlife agencies to increase                public participation in hunting and shooting sports.               Projections                of declining hunters and shooters are disturbing, because these                people provide the social, financial and political support for wildlife                management in North America.               Arizona                Game and Fish Department leaders saw the handwriting on the wall.                The legacy of hunting and shooting sports, and the cornerstone of                wildlife management, could be lost to future generations if steps                weren’t taken.               In                September 2004, department leaders decided to create a cross-functional                department Hunter Retention and Recruitment Team (HRR Team) that                was told to scour the nation, find all the best ideas and practices,                then to think innovatively and come up with a game plan for increasing                hunter and shooting retention and recruitment here in Arizona.               The                HRR Team employed a variety of tools and methods to identify relevant                issues and generate concepts that would address the primary objectives                it was tasked to address. It took months of hard work, discussion                and information synthesis.               The                final team report encompassed 178 pages, but the team came up with                the following 12 recommendations as the base steps needed:                                                 Construct a comprehensive property management plan for the wildlife                  area complex that includes Robbins Butte, Powers Butte and the                  Arlington Wildlife Management Area that promotes small game opportunity                  and provides a venue for hunter recruitment and retention activities.                                                     Develop a short-term hunting lease program through Landowners                  Relations designed to obtain access to provide lands for small                  game hunting opportunities.                                                     Implement enhancements to the department’s hunter education                  program that promote course convenience and flexibility to customers                  and that further institute adaptive management evaluation-management                  practices.                                   Charter                  a team to identify improvements in the delivery of hunting information                  through the annual regulations booklet in a manner that encourages                  and facilitates use and understanding, especially by new, inexperienced                  hunters.                                   Evaluate                  existing big game draw and hunt structures to maximize hunting                  opportunity on a sustainable basis.                                   Institute                  special licenses that promote participation of new hunters through                  family-friend social structures that serve to reinforce and support                  hunting activities.                                   Incorporate                  enhancements to the department’s Web page that promote and                  support hunter recruitment-retention programs and activities.                                   Create                  a new hunter recruitment and retention coordinator position in                  the Information and Education Division to launch and coordinate                  hunter recruitment-retention programs, activities and promotions.                                   Establish                  a full-time shooting range development coordinator position in                  the Information and Education Division to promote convenient public                  access to shooting sports and shooting ranges.                                   Launch                  coordinated department-wide public information and outreach efforts                  that promote hunting and otherwise reinforce hunter recruitment-retention                  efforts.                                   Update                  the department’s strategic planning documents to proactively                  address urban encroachment as it relates to maintain small game                  hunting opportunities in proximity to urban areas, which advance                  hunter recruitment and retention efforts.                                   Conduct                  periodic reviews of important hunt draw and license sales data                  and trends and apply adaptive management practices to department                  hunt recruitment-retention programs as needed.                             These                recommendations were embraced by department management and adopted                by the commission. Since that time, those 12 recommendations have                spawned a host of activities, actions, and changes, especially when                it comes to traditional hunt structures.               back                to top                                                 Junior                Hunters:               Genevieve                Drachman gets her first mule deer               Submitted                by Boyd Drachman, father               The                following junior hunter success story is one to make any seasoned                hunter smile - what a buck .

After                lengthy public testimony, the Arizona Game and Fish Commission on                Aug. 11 approved the 2008-2009 hunt guidelines – including                over-the-counter turkey tags for youth in good habitat units –                that are intended to aid hunter retention and recruitment efforts                in the future by increasing hunt opportunities.               “Big                game management and our hunt guideline package have always been                well within the biological limitations of the species we hunt. We                are not compromising the biology in these recommendations,”                Game Chief Leonard Ordway told the commission               These                guidelines, he said, will provide more hunters with the opportunity                to go hunting, while equitably distributing opportunity among the                various seasons and also providing quality hunt opportunities.               Ordway                emphasized that the hunt guidelines are not “liberal”                in any sense. “These guidelines bring us in line with many                other western states with things like buck-to-doe ratios.”               Ordway                explained that biologically, the new guidelines won’t substantially                change ungulate populations nor will they significantly reduce quality                opportunities.                 “These                guidelines will allow us to put more hunters in the field, which                is exactly what scientifically conducted surveys have shown that                many Arizona hunters desire. The guidelines also provide for quality                hunting opportunities that another segment of the hunting public                desire as well,” Ordway said.               “These                guidelines will be used by our field biologists when determining                the individual, unit-by-unit hunt recommendations that will come                before the commission during the next two years,” Ordway told                the commission.               The                first practical deployment of these guidelines will be for the 2008                elk-antelope hunt recommendations that will come before the commission                at its Dec. 7-8 meeting in Casa Grande.               Archery                season adjustments                The archery deer seasons in some units will be adjusted to limit                archery take to about 20 percent of the total harvest in a hunt                unit.                “The                specific units are not spelled out in the guidelines, and this confuses                some of the public,” explained Big Game Supervisor Brian Wakeling.                “The information we shared at public meetings and with the                commission was preliminary and probable, but could be adjusted based                on collection of another year of data.”               Based                on initial analysis of demand and harvest, these new guidelines                could result in the following:                                Seven                  units will be placed in the draw for archery (Units 1, 3A/3C,                  3B, 7, 12A, 13A, 13B). Unit 13B has never had an archery deer                  season, but will be added because archery harvest can be regulated                  by permitting the hunt.                                                      Another seven units are likely to have the December season                  eliminated for archery deer (17A, 20A, 22, 23, 35A, 37A, 42).                                    Three                  units will likely add some January opportunity because they are                  currently below 10 percent of total take (4A/4B, 8, 9).                             Ordway                explained to the commission that the guidelines were constructed                in such a way that when the archery harvest exceeds demand in a                unit, then the archery in that unit will be restricted by shortening                the season or limiting archers through the draw process. Prior to                this, the only method the agency had to restrict harvest was to                place increasing restriction on general season opportunities.                 “It’s                all about being equitable and fair about available hunting opportunities,”                Ordway said.               The                changes do not necessarily mean that archers will lose any overall                hunting opportunities they have had in recent years, Ordway said,                only that there is now a cap so that archery hunters will not affect                the hunting opportunities of general season hunters.                Archers                may purchase over-the-counter tags to hunt in open units and apply                for those units offered through the draw. The one-deer-per-calendar-year                bag limit still applies, but archers should not see any reduction                in the overall number of days that they can hunt statewide.                 “This                all means that in certain units where archery demand and harvest                is encroaching on general hunt opportunities, archers will have                to compete on a level playing field in the draw process for the                available opportunities,” Ordway explained.               Ordway                also said that despite rumors to the contrary, the department has                no immediate intent to put all archery deer hunts into the draw                process. “Could this eventually happen many years down the                road? I can’t tell you it won’t, but I honestly don’t                think it will happen in the short term,” Ordway said.               This                isn’t about forcing everyone into a more restrictive draw                process, he said, but rather, creating equity and fairness in the                process for everyone. “This is essentially the equitable allocation                formula developed for the elk draw years ago, and most hunters have                been generally comfortable with that system.”               In                addition, archery bull elk permits will be offered in standard population                management zones during November (25 bull tags each) if not already                offered, or in September if not already offered.                White-tailed                deer                Five percent of the white-tailed deer permits will be offered in                December (rather than 10 percent during the last two years). This                is similar in allocation to what was offered in the Region 5 white-tailed                deer units until two years ago.               Units                6A, 23, 30B, 31, and 36C were added to alternative units (managed                for quality) for white-tailed deer. Buck-to-doe ratios will be managed                at 20-30 in these units, and 30-percent of the harvest will be targeted                for the December season.                “Our                guidelines will maintain some incredible quality hunt opportunities                for white-tailed deer in some units, while at the same time creating                more hunting opportunities in other units,” Ordway said.               Turkey                (over-the-counter junior permits)                Fall turkey seasons will be limited weapon shotgun shooting shot.                Surveys show that the vast majority of fall turkey hunters use shotguns,                and this change brings the hunt in line with the common practice                for turkey hunts throughout the west and the nation.               “Turkey                hunting is already very safe, but this makes it even safer,”                Wakeling said, adding that this change is supported by the National                Wild Turkey Federation.               A                significant change for the future will be juniors-only turkey. Units                that score as an ""A"" (excellent) in the habitat-population                status matrix will offer juniors over-the-counter permits for spring                and fall turkey.               However,                hunt units that score as a ""B"" (good) in the habitat-population                status matrix will offer juniors over-the-counter permits for spring                turkey.               “This                way, if dad, mom, grandpa or whomever gets a turkey tag in the applicable                units, they can take the young hunter with them. Or if nothing else,                to just take a young hunter out turkey hunting. This really allows                families to experience and pass along this valuable hunting legacy,”                Wakeling said.               National                surveys indicate that when youth can experience such positive hunts                with their family, they are much more likely become life-long hunters.               Javelina                Fall javelina tags will be offered to juniors-only and occur during                the juniors deer hunt time frame.               “This                change will allow youth to hunt javelina and deer together during                the fall, creating a valuable learning experience for the young                hunters and a lot of fun for the family,” Ordway said.               This                change in the fall javelina structure will help families maximize                their time in the field “In these days of increasing gas prices                and dwindling free time, it can be very important for families to                better capitalize on their opportunities and recreational dollars,”                Ordway said.               Other                units in the state that have juniors deer hunts may offer juniors                javelina seasons during the fall.               The                guidelines also offer 10 percent of the total number of javelina                tags authorized during a given year to junior hunters.                Finally,                hunt success has been added as a management guideline for javelina,                with a target of 20-25 percent.                Small                game                Small game and fall turkey seasons will begin one week earlier (less                chance of conflicting with the opening of deer seasons). Fall turkey                seasons will remain one week long.                Squirrel                season has been extended to run through year end, and in Units 31                and 33 in southeastern Arizona (sky island country), tassel-eared                squirrel seasons will run yearlong.                “We                really wanted to maximize the fun that small game hunting opportunities                provide to our hunt public,” Ordway said.               National                statistics show an overall decrease in small game hunters.               “With                our abundant small game hunting opportunities in Arizona, we have                a real opportunity to reverse that trend. We are even stepping up                our efforts to conduct small game camps for new hunters, and those                new to the state, so more people can learn to enjoy the tremendous                small game opportunities across the state from quail and dove to                squirrel and waterfowl,” Ordway said.               Other                new guidelines                               Buck-to-doe                  management guidelines have been shifted to 10-20 for mule deer                  and 15-25 for white-tailed deer.                                   Bull-to-cow                  management guidelines have been shifted to 15-25 for elk.                                   Bighorn                  sheep management guidelines have been adjusted to target the harvest                  of 15-25 percent of the Class III and IV rams.                                   Annual                  female harvest limits have been added to bear hunts and will be                  approved by the commission in the season-setting process of commission                  orders. These have already been established for spring 2008 and                  will appear in the spring hunt booklet.                                              back                to top                                                   Been                hunting? Jimmy Herman has, and he's hooked               By                James Herman, father, Kingman                           The                following is a thank-you letter, sent by a father of two, to Hunter                Education Instructor Cliff Saylor, about a family's trek on a juniors                only elk hunt, shortly after completing the hunter education course.                This is another example of how education programs and the outdoors                build great relationships.                                               Cliff, we just got back from Jimmy’s elk hunt – he didn’t                get one – but everything else was perfect.               We                saw elk consistently throughout the hunt – at least twice                a day everyday.                Jimmy                didn’t get a shot off – the first few times he stood                in awe and didn’t even move the gun. Several of the others                just happened too fast.               The                best couple of times, he didn’t have a clean shot because                of the way they were grouped up. I don’t think I’ve                seen as many elk in all my elk hunts as we saw this weekend.               We                had Mike carry an empty .22 just for practice. They were both flawless                as far as safety and gun handling. They’d pass the guns back                and forth, going over and around obstacles. They kept them pointed                in safe directions without being told. Jimmy took his shells out                before I had to remind him. He never pulled the hammer back until                he was on target (I wasn’t sure I’d remember to remind                him to do it, so I was very impressed). It was great! The phrases                “in our hunter’s safety course” and “Cliff                said” came up frequently all weekend.               They                were still excited about the hunt this morning. I mentioned that                we should probably put scopes on their .22’s and do more rabbit                and squirrel hunting to get them used to drawing on a target and                shooting. They asked me to get that done this week so we can go                Saturday morning. I’m pretty sure this hunt hooked them for                good.                               Thanks                for everything, your class played a big role in their excitement                and behavior this weekend.

An                online survey and a telephone survey of recent hunt applicants conducted                for the Arizona Game and Fish Department by Responsive Management                of Harrisonburg, Virginia, last year showed that the majority of                this state’s hunters just want to get a hunt-permit tag, especially                for elk, and the quality of the animal is not a major concern.                But                another segment of the hunting public is very interested in managing                for conservative, quality hunts.               The                challenge facing the Arizona Game and Fish Commission and Department                is to achieve that delicate balancing act and provide opportunities                to meet the desires and needs of all hunters. It’s not an                easy balancing act, but it does require quality information to achieve                with any degree of success.               The                Arizona Game and Fish Commission invited the director of Responsive                Management, Mark Damian Duda, to meet with them in a work session                during its summer meeting in Flagstaff to discuss the survey, its                methodology, its validity, and its applicability to wildlife management                in the state.               Duda                told the commission that Responsive Management has conducted hundreds                of such surveys in 30 or 40 states during the past 20 years. “We                have no dog in this fight. We just use scientifically sound methods                to gather information.”               If                the Arizona survey had shown anything different than all the other                surveys across the United States, Duda said, there might be some                reason to question the validity. It did not. “The surveys                show the same pattern here in Arizona that we are seeing across                the country.”                Duda                said he understands the dilemma facing the Game and Fish Commission                in Arizona. “Bottom line, you are confronted with how to please                two divergent publics or markets. It’s not an easy decision                facing you.”               Duda                said there is one public of avid, knowledgeable hunters who care                deeply about the state’s wildlife, and who are tremendous                supporters of the department and its mission, and who can wield                a lot of power in the process. “They are at the higher end                of the hunting spectrum. They want trophy animals. They are the                well-informed and influential minority.”               Then                there are the average hunters who are the silent majority. “The                surveys show that most hunters just want the opportunity to hunt.                Harvesting a quality animal is not at the top of their list.,”                Duda said. “I am not making any value judgments. That’s                just what they do and what they want. This is really not an issue                of surveys, but what different markets want.”               For                us as researchers, Duda said, it is a relatively easy process to                get the answers. “For you as decision makers, it is a difficult                process. I can’t tell you what decisions to make, only what                the valid surveys show in the marketplace. Our role is to simply                gather the information.”               Duda                explained that in conducting the surveys, his company used the multiple                satisfaction approach where the respondents make choices or rate                what is most important to them.                The                respondents are simply provided a list, and they choose from that                list on what is most important to them. Most Arizona hunters overwhelmingly                chose the opportunity to go hunting as most important, and rated                harvesting a quality animal quite a ways down the list.               Duda                said there are some who will not like a survey just because its                results are contrary to deeply held belief systems, such as a survey                Responsive Management did in Maryland, where 75 percent of the residents                said they support hunting. “There was only one question on                the survey that an animal protection group liked.”               “We’ve                seen it time and again. These questions that support our views are                valid and those questions that don’t support our beliefs are                not valid,” Duda said.               All                surveys are designed to do is reflect the varying opinions in the                marketplace. “One of my professors said that science seeks                questions, policy demands answers. Seeking the questions was the                easy part of this. You face the tougher task,” Duda told the                commission.                               back                to top                                    J un ior                hunters:                Samantha Parrish, successful elk hunter               By                Larry Parrish, father                           The                following is yet another great success story sent by a proud father.                Larry Parrish wanted to thank Samanatha's hunter education instructor,                Cliff Saylor, for teaching her how to be a true steward of the land.                Cliff, you are doing an outstanding job with these young hunters.                                                Cliff                here is a picture of Samanthas first big game animal!                               She did very well and I was surprised at how calm she stayed during                the whole thing.                We                made a stalk onto this cow and had to crawl about 60 yards to get                a good clean shot on it.                It                took 2 shots to get it, but she placed both shots perfectly.               Thanks                to you for teaching her good ethics and sharing your stories because                it was the hunt of a lifetime for her and me!                                         back                to top                                                       Ride                responsibly when using OHV's                By Jim Harken, public information officer,                Arizona                Game and Fish Department               The                Arizona Game and Fish Department reminds all hunters to be cautious                and courteous when using off-highway vehicles out on a hunt.               The                best advice for OHV users is simply:                “Walk                while you stalk.”                Get                out to your location early and walk so that you don’t interrupt                other hunters or scare away game with machine noise.                              Many hunters have complained that after a long hike to their favorite                hunting spot and a good stalk on their game, their animal is scared                away at the last minute by someone crashing through the area on                a loud OHV.                Be                sensitive by trying to only use your OHV to retrieve your harvested                game. Here are some good rules of thumb to follow when out on the                hunt:                                                                Minimize                    impact to wildlife and other hunters by staying on roads and                    trails.                                                                         Always make sure that the area you go into is open for                    OHV use. There are many seasonal closings of areas, so make                    sure they are open before you leave.                                                                         Keep the noise level down by making sure your muffler                    is in good working order.                                                                         Use extra caution when fording wash areas or streams.                    Use the 90 degree approach, and cross at the approved trail                    crossing only.                                                                         Watch for hunters on foot and respect their right to be                    in the same area.                                                                         Carry out everything that you carry in, don’t litter                    and keep Arizona beautiful.                                                                         Only use your ATV for recovery of harvested game or to                    get to your location.                                             The                department wants this to be a very successful hunting season for                all hunters. Safe and considerate OHV usage is a step in the right                direction.

Program                restores bighorn sheep to their historic habitats                By Doug Burt, public information officer,               Arizona                Game and Fish Department                                        Arizona's                bighorn sheep population received a boost in November when the Arizona                Game and Fish Department, along with vital assistance from the Arizona                Desert Bighorn Sheep Society, Yuma Proving Ground, and Bureau of                Land Management, conducted its 100th capture-translocation.                                        The                translocation program, celebrating its 50th year, aims to restore                or enhance bighorn sheep populations in their historic habitats.                The result of this logistically challenging and laborious process                is to secure a valuable natural resource that benefits all Arizonans.                                        Thirteen                desert bighorn sheep, 11 ewes (females) and two rams (males), were                captured on the Yuma Proving Ground near Martinez Lake, north of                Yuma, on Friday and were released in the Big Horn Mountains, about                90 miles west of Phoenix, on Saturday.                ""These                captures and releases are part of a long effort to bring these magnificent                animals back from the brink of extirpation and restore them to their                historic habitats,"" says Brian Wakeling, big game supervisor                for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.               In                the late 1800s, bighorn sheep were eliminated from a large portion                of their range as a result of exposure to disease and unregulated                hunting. In 1893, the Territorial Legislature passed a five-year                moratorium banning all hunting of bighorn sheep, yet populations                continued to decline. By the 1950s, bighorn populations in Arizona                had dwindled significantly, and some feared they might be lost forever.               In                1953, Arizona established regulated hunting of bighorn rams as a                way to raise awareness and generate funding for research and management                efforts needed to fully recover desert bighorn sheep populations.                Special interests groups, hunters, biologists and conservationists                rallied together in this effort – an effort that continues                today.               The                department conducted its first translocation in 1957. Since that                first event, the department has moved close to 1,800 animals within                Arizona. Today, mostly due to translocation efforts, Arizona’s                bighorn sheep population is just over 6,000. Additionally, through                the program, two species of bighorn sheep call Arizona home - the                desert bighorn and Rocky Mountain bighorn.               The                department’s program has also supported other western states,                sheep restoration efforts by transplanting 81 sheep to Colorado,                58 to New Mexico, 36 to Texas and 46 to Utah.                                        ""The                endeavor to restore the populations of these superb animals over                the decades has been a classic cooperative effort between many partners                and volunteers,"" says Wakeling.                                        To                assure the health of the animals, retired veterinarian, Clancy Gansberg,                volunteered his time, much like he has done for over 20 years. Personnel                from Liberty Wildlife were also on hand to assist in the safe processing                of animals. Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters was contracted for                the highly technical process of locating, capturing and transporting                sheep from mountainous and rugged terrain.               Restoration                efforts have involved enhanced land use planning, interagency cooperation,                water developments, conservation hunt strategies, translocations,                habitat studies and mitigation, and many hours of volunteer support.

Canyon                Lake Fish Habitat Enhancement Project                This project involves the construction of fish habitat to benefit                largemouth and smallmouth bass, sunfish, catfish, crappie, as well                as provide fishing “hotspots” for the angling public.                The work will utilize wooden pallets, cement blocks and juniper                trees to build “pisces pyramids” during a scheduled                50-foot drawdown of the lake. Volunteers will help load and transport                materials to work sites around the lake via boats and construct                habitat units on the dry lakebed at pre-selected sites. Work hours                will be from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. during the work dates. Volunteers                are asked to bring their own gloves, beverages, meals and appropriate                clothing to suit the winter weather and must schedule work dates                by calling the habitat project coordinator. Dates are  Nov.                17 – Dec. 16, (Friday-Sunday weekend days) at Canyon Lake,                Palo Verde Recreation Site, located 32 miles east of Mesa on Highway                88 (Apache Trail).

Black-footed ferret spring spotlighing project               The                Black-footed Ferret Project is planning another large spotlighting                effort for the nights of March 20-24, 2008. Please sign up early,                as space is limited and people had to be turned away last event.               Requirements                for spotlighting:                                stay                  attentive from sunset to sunrise.                                   carry up to 30-pound backpack for two-hour durations                                   use or learn how to use a GPS unit                                              What is involved?                 Spotlighting involves the use of high-powered lights to locate and                identify black-footed ferrets. Once a ferret is located, a trap                is set in the burrow. When the animal is caught the ferret is delivered                to a process trailer. This will allow the team a once in a lifetime                opportunity to view a ferret up close while the biologists processes                the animal. The animal’s health will be assessed and a passive                integrated transponder (PIT) tag inserted subcutaneously. PIT tags                allow us to individually identify animals upon recapture. The ferret                is then released into the same burrow where it was trapped.                Gear                can be a limiting factor for the number of people that may attend,                if you have any of the following, please bring it for your use:                               Headlamp                  or flashlight (these will not be provided)                  GPS                  unit                                   Pen (to record data)                                   Compass (to record direction that trap is set)                                   Binoculars                                   Appropriate clothing **                 High                  clearance vehicle, 4x4 (mileage is tax deductible)                             **                Multiple layers are best, as March nights can be cold, but you will                warm up while backpack spotlighting. Raingear is highly recommended.                Also, be sure to bring plenty of snacks and water. Snacking throughout                the night will help you to stay awake.

A trap field consists of one house containing a target thrower that launches clay targets at random angles. Shooters are positioned 16 yards behind the trap house on 5 different positions. A full squad consists of one shooter on each station (5 shooters total). Shooters will only shoot single birds starting with the shooter on post 1 then moving on to posts 2,3,4 and 5. Once each shooter has shot 5 targets at their station, they rotate to the next station. A complete round of trap consists of 25 targets, 5 at each station.    Several variations of American trap are also shot on the same field. For doubles trap, 2 targets are thrown simultaneously at fixed angles. Each shooter shoots at 5 pairs of targets per station for a total of 50 targets per round.   International trap includes only one target at a time, but the targets may be thrown at different elevations. In International (also known as 'bunker') trap, the traphouse is underground and there are 15 different trap machines used to throw targets. International targets are slightly larger in diameter with less dome than standard targets and are thrown faster.  Two shots may be used for each target in international trap.  Skeet   Skeet was invented in the early 1920's as a way to practice wing-shooting skills for the field.  The game of skeet has two ""houses"" from which the targets are electronically launched. The high house which is on the left and the low house which is on the right side of the field. There are eight stations located in a semi-circle between the two houses. A complete round consists of 25 targets. At stations 1,2,6 and 7 the shooter will shoot a single target from the high house and then a single target from the low house. Following the single targets the shooter will then shoot a double which is a target from each house thrown at the same time. When shooting a double, always shoot the bird that comes out of the closest house first. On stations 3,4 and 5 the shooter will shoot a single from both houses starting with the high house. The first target that is missed is shot again which is called an ""option"". Only one option is shot per round. If no targets have been missed upon the completion of shooting low house 8, the option will be shot as a second target from low 8.    Doubles skeet consist of two targets per station. The first round of doubles consists of 24 targets by moving from station 1 through 7, and then working back to station 2 shooting 2 targets per station. The second round goes from station 1 to 7, then back to 1 and consists of 13 pairs for a total of 26 targets. The total for the two rounds is 50 targets.  International skeet is much different than American skeet. The targets are larger (110mm), are moving much faster, and a more complicated sequence of targets is thrown.  International skeet includes doubles targets at stations 3,4 and 5.   The shooter must also start with their gun un-mounted until the target emerges from the house.  Skeet Field Detailed Diagram  (*.pdf file)  Sporting Clays   Sporting Clays is the newest clay target sport and was introduced from England and simulates an unlimited variety of game shooting situations. This game is shot on a course rather than a field and the number of stations may vary. Every sporting clays course is different and the same course is often different each day. Many of the stations are set up to simulate hunting situations. Besides the standard 108mm targets shot in trap and skeet, sporting clays also use 90mm targets, 60mm targets, targets that turn in mid-air, and extremely rigid targets designed to bounce on the ground to simulate rabbits. Sporting clays courses often use both manual and electronic target launchers. Although some sporting clays courses have single target shots, most stations have pairs of targets. True pairs release both targets at the same time. Report pairs throw one target, and the second is released when the first is shot. Releasing one target directly after the other is called a following pair.    Five Stand   Five stand, like sporting clays, is different on every course. There are five stations similar to trap, but there are 5 or 6 target throwers. A different sequence of targets is shot from each station, often in pairs. The order of the targets is listed at each station.    Competition Style Olympic Archery   Flat round multi-color targets are set up in a row between 30 and 90 meters.  Shot using only recurve bows.    Archers use a non-magnifying front sight but no rear sight.  This style of archery is most similar to the type used in the Archery in the Schools Program.  For more information, visit   http://www.usarchery.org     Competition Style Field Archery   Flat targets at known distances are spaced on a roving course in a natural setting.  Archers most often use compound bows with front and rear sights.  However, tournament divisions exist for other types of equipment including recurve bows and traditional wood longbows.  For more information, visit   http://www.usarchery.org     Competition Style 3-D Archery   Three-dimensional foam targets are set on a roving natural course at unknown distances.  Archers shoot at faint scoring rings molded into the animal targets.  Compound bows with front and rear sights are often used.

Several archery equipment manufacturers and organizations are also partners. The program promotes student education and participation in the life long sport of Archery. The program's focus is to provide International style target archery training in physical education classes, for grades 4-12.   Department of Natural Resources Objective:   Declining participation in the shooting sports threatens financial and public support for wildlife conservation. The NASP has been successful in teaching 1.4 million students during school hours in 2006 alone. We expect many of these young people to make Archery a life sport.    Department of Education Objective:  Engage more students in the educational process to improve classroom performance and reduce dropout rates.  The national school dropout rate is 10%. Most students (88%) who drop out of school indicate they were not involved in extra-curricular activities. Archery taught by the NASP is accessible to all students of nearly all age groups. Educators are reporting that the NASP ""engages the unengaged"" and inspires students to greater achievement in school.   Development History:  The program began in Kentucky in 2002 with the training of 39 educators and 22 middle school pilot projects.  At the conclusion of their 2-week target archery class, 1,600 students were surveyed (55% boys and 45% girls).  Survey results are as follows:   Before the Class:   72% did not own a bow & 62% had never shot a bow before     After the Class:   89% enjoyed the archery class   45% wanted to own archery equipment   59% wanted to become target archers   38% wanted to try bowhunting     Current Status (as of January 2008)    74 million students have participated.   75,000 schools have joined.   Nearly 100 schools in Iowa have adopted the program.   49 states have adopted the program as of 2008.  Australia and Canada have also joined NASP.

Currently there are nearly 100 Iowa schools participating in the program.  The second NASP Iowa Championship is scheduled for March 7th, 2009.  The Iowa DNR provides NASP Basic Archery Instructor (BAI) training throughout the state to teachers and archery program organizers.  BAI training is provided at no cost to teachers conducting NASP programs as part of a 2 week in-school course.  To start a NASP program in your school, to schedule or sign up for training, or for questions on NASP in Iowa, contact Ben Berka, Shooting Sports Coordinator for the Iowa DNR at 515-281-0140 or at  Ben.Berka@dnr.iowa.gov    About the Iowa Archery in the Schools Foundation    The Iowa Archery in the Schools Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization formed to promote youth archery in Iowa.  The organization's funding is provided by the Iowa State Archery Association, the Iowa Bowhunter's Association, the Iowa National Wild Turkey Federation and through generous donations from companies and individuals.

Wikipedia-Article ""Clays""                 For the town in the  United States , see  Clay, New York .             Quaternary  clay in  Estonia .       Clay  is a generic term for an aggregate of  hydrous   silicate   particles  less than 4 m ( micrometres ) in  diameter . Clay consists of a variety of  phyllosilicate  minerals rich in  silicon  and  aluminium   oxides  and  hydroxides  which include variable amounts of structural  water . Clays are generally formed by the chemical  weathering  of silicate-bearing rocks by  carbonic acid , but some are formed by  hydrothermal  activity. Clays are distinguished from other small particles present in  soils  such as  silt  by their small size, flake or layered shape, affinity for water and high  plasticity index .   There are three main groups of clays:  kaolinite - serpentine ,  illite , and  smectite . Altogether, there are about thirty different types of ""pure"" clays in these categories, but most ""natural"" clays are mixtures of these different types, as well as other weathered minerals.   Montmorillonite , with a chemical formula of ( Na , Ca ) 0.33 ( Al , Mg ) 2 Si 4 O 10 ( OH ) 2  n H 2 O, is typically formed as a weathering product of low silica rocks. Montmorillonite is a member of the smectite group and a major component of  bentonite .   Varve  (or  varved clay ) is clay with visible annual layers, formed by seasonal differences in erosion and organic content. This type of deposit is common in former glacial lakes from the  ice age .   Quick clay  is a unique type of marine clay, indigenous to the glaciated terrains of  Norway ,  Canada , and  Sweden . It is a highly sensitive clay, prone to  liquefaction  which has been involved in several deadly  landslides .   [ edit ]     Historical and modern uses of clay   Clays are heavy in texture yet soft to the touch. Clay is a malleable substance when wet, which means it can be shaped easily with the hands. When dry, it becomes firm and when ""fired,"" or hardened by intense heat, clay becomes permanently solid. A fireplace specifically designed for hardening clay is called a  kiln . These properties make clay an ideal subtance for making pottery, stoneware and various other practical items. Early humans discovered the useful properties of clay in prehistoric times, and one of the earliest artifacts ever uncovered is a drinking vessel made of sun-dried clay. Depending on the content of the soil, clay can appear in various colors, from a dull gray to a deep orange-red.   Clays  sintered  in fire were the first  ceramic , and remain one of the cheapest to produce and most widely used materials even in the present day.  Bricks , cooking pots, art objects,  dishware ,  spark plug  bodies, and even musical instruments such as the  ocarina  are all made with clay. Clay is also used in many industrial processes, such as  paper  making,  concrete  production, and chemical  filtering .

According to the 2005-2006 National Safety Council 'Injury Facts' report, firearms were involved in less than 1% of all accidental fatalities.  For comparison, the same study showed that motor vehicles were the cause of 43% of all accidental fatalities.  This figure accounts for all accidental shootings involving firearms and does not accurately address the much safer track record of the target shooting sports.  In a study done using data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, the safety record of archery was compared to other common sports in schools.  These data indicate that archery is one of the safest sports with and injury rate of less than one incident per 1,000 participants.  Other youth activities like golf, soccer, basketball and baseball have an injury rate from 2 to 25 times that of archery.  The impeccable safety record of the shooting sports is largely due to the safety rules and procedures that are followed and adhered to by participants of these sports.  Below are some safety rules and guidelines for some of the target shooting sports.

Through organized clay target shooting, youth are learning lifelong skills such as firearm safety, teamwork, respect for self and others, mental focus, and self-discipline.   Sponsored by the Scholastic Shooting Sports Foundation (SSSF) and the national governing bodies of each sport, SCTP has more than 10,000 participants nationwide.  In Iowa, the Scholastic Clay Target Program has joined forces with the strong tradition of Iowa high school trapshooting programs to establish a spring shooting season for organized trap, skeet, and sporting clays.  Starting in March, teams are lead by certified coaches, practices are conducted, and local matches are held with neighboring teams.  All of these activities lead up to the Iowa High School and SCTP Championships each May.   High School and SCTP programs can be either club or school based but high school team competitions are strictly between teams whose squad members are all from the same school.

Once your team is signed up, participation cards will be issued to each athlete and the team may participate in and/or host shoots with other area teams.  Coaches of teams participating in the Scholastic Clay Target Program must also complete the SCTP's online registration process using the completed forms prior to sending hard copies to the DNR.    Once signed up, coaches will be provided with login information to perform team management, state shoot squadding, etc.  Team registration materials (including Consent and Waiver Forms for each athlete) must be received at the DNR office prior to participating in an Invitational event.

              What is Clay Pigeon Shooting                                           Clay pigeon shooting is the art of shooting at special flying targets known as clay pigeons or clay targets with a shotgun.   The sport of clay pigeon shooting offers participants of all ages and genders the opportunity to compete at events which range from local through to provincial, national and international competitions up to and including the Olympic Games and it is a sport of great physical skill and mental ability. The ICPSA caters for participants at all levels from novice through to Olympic athletes and the Association is the National Governing Body in Ireland responsible for the Olympic/international and domestic disciplines. However not all ICPSA members are driven by competition and the sport has much to offer those who would like to participate in an activity that can be as challenging as you wish to make it and offers the opportunity to represent your club, county, province or indeed country.     The Disciplines Clay pigeon shooting has at least 20 different forms of regulated competition called disciplines. These can be roughly divided into three main groups, Trap, Skeet and Sporting: Trap In ""trap"", targets are thrown either as singles or doubles from one or more ""traps"" (the machine used to launch the target). These traps are usually situated some 15m in front of the shooter and the trajectories of the targets are generally set so that they are going away from the firing point at varying speeds, angles and elevations. The most common disciplines in this group are: Down-the-Line (DTL), Single Barrel (SB), Double Rise(DR), Automatic Ball Trap (ABT), Olympic Trap(OT), Double Trap (DT) and Universal Trench (UT). The participants usually pre-mount the gun into their shoulder and the target is released when the shooter calls ""pull"" or gives some similar vocal indication that they are ready. The traps are generally electrically operated and most venues now use acoutically activated electronic release systems to launch the target. Down the Line : Also known as DTL, is a popular clay shooting discipline. Targets are thrown to a distance of 45 to 50 metres at a fixed height of approximately 2.75m and with a horizontal 'spread' of up to 22 degrees either side of the centre line.  A squad is made up of five persons and each competitor shoots at a single target in turn without moving from their stand until all the squad members have shot five targets.  Then all the squad members move one place to the right with stand 5 moving back to stand 1 and the participants continue to shoot 5 targets from each stand until all the squad members have completed a standard round of 25 birds or targets.  Scoring of each target is 3 points for a first barrel kill, 2 points for a second barrel kill and 0 for a miss (maximum 75 points per round). Variations of this discipline are: Single Barrel, Double Rise and Handicap-by-Distance. Olympic Trap : As it's name indicates, this is one of the disciplines which forms part of the shooting programme at the Olympic Games.  A trench built beneath ground level in front of the shooting stands conceals 15 traps arranged in 5 groups of 3. Shooters take turns to shoot at a target each, before moving in a clockwise direction to the next stand in the line.  Targets for each shooter are thrown immediately upon his call and are selected by a shooting scheme that ensures all competitors receive exactly the same target selection, but in a unpredictable randomised order, from any one of the three traps directly in front of him.  Olympic Trap targets are set to travel 76 metres at varying elevations and with a maximum horizontal angle of 45 degrees either side of the centre line. Scoring is done of the basis of 1 point per target hit, regardless of whether this is achieved with the first or with the second barrel.  A simpler and cheaper to install variation of this discipline is known as Universal Trench (UT) where only five traps are used as well as Automatic Ball Trap (ABT) where only one trap is used and target variation is obtained by the continuous oscillation of the trap in both horizontal and vertical directions in order to give the same spread of targets as in Olympic Trap. Similarly, the targets are also thrown to a maximum of 80 metres. Skeet Skeet is a word of Scandinavian origin, though the discipline originated in America. Targets are thrown in singles and doubles from 2 trap houses situated some 40 metres apart at opposite ends of a semicircular arc on which there are seven shooting positions.  The targets are thrown at set trajectories and speeds and the main disciplines in this group are National Skeet, Olympic Skeet and American (NSSA) Skeet. In skeet, variety is achieved by shooting round the seven stations in a semicircle. Scoring is on the basis of 1 point per target hit, up to a maximum of 25. National Skeet:  By far the most popular of the skeet disciplines, the gun position is optional (i.e. pre-mounted or out-of-shoulder when the target is called) and the targets are released immediately upon the shooter's call. Olympic Skeet:   The targets travel at a considerably faster speed, the release of the target can be delayed up to 3 seconds after calling and the gun-down position is compulsory.  There is also an eighth shooting station which is situated midway between the two trap houses. Sporting The ""Sporting"" discipline probably has the biggest following in Ireland and while the other disciplines only use standard targets, in Sporting almost anything goes!  Targets are thrown in a great variety of trajectories, angles, speeds, elevations and distances and the discipline was originally devised to simulate live quarry shooting.  Hence some of the names commonly used to describe Sporting stands include Springing Teal, Driven Pheasant, Bolting Rabbit, Crossing Pigeon, Dropping Duck, etc.  Disciplines in this group include Sporting, FITASC (International) Sporting, Super Sporting, Sportrap and Compak Sporting. Sporting : This discipline is sometimes referred to as ""English Sporting"" and can have an infinite variety of 'stands'. A  course or competition will feature a given number of stands each of which has a predetermined number of targets, all travelling along the same path and speed, either as singles or doubles.  Each stand will feature a different type of target i.e. crosser, driven, quartering etc.  FITASC:  Also known as International Sporting, this discipline gives a much greater variety of targets in terms of trajectory and speed, and is shot by squads of six competitors in rounds of 25 targets at a time.  Super Sporting  is a hybrid of the two preceding varieties.  There are also other formats such as Compak Sporting and Sportap in which five cages are surrounded by a number of traps, and shooters fire a specific combinations of singles and doubles from each stand according to a program displayed in front of the cage.

THIS STORY       E-mail             Print                            Delicious       Digg this     Facebook      The registered student organization, which has about 20 members, is housed at the Wilmington Trapshooting Association, located just south of Glasgow off Route 40. The team also has turned in some very favorable performances in competitions up and down the Mid-Atlantic region and beyond.      Club president Greg Doyle, a senior fitness management major from Pine Bush, N.Y., has been shooting since age 11, when he began accompanying his uncle, who along with his grandfather owned and ran a marina in Port Washington, Long Island.   “I never shot competitively until this year,” Doyle said. “I like the sporting clays competition, and I went to a few events and went online and found that there were several collegiate teams and that there was also a national collegiate championship in the sport.”   At a recent competition at West Point, N.Y., the UD team finished second to the U.S. Military Academy and just ahead of the University of Connecticut in third.   “It was an amazing trip to West Point. Our team members stayed over night in the barracks with the with U.S. Army team members,” Doyle said. “We got to tour the entire campus, which was gorgeous. The next day we all met out at the range, where is just past where they shoot tanks with rockets, and up on the hill were a bunch of blown-up tanks.”   Doyle said that the West Point trap and skeet shooting team club house was funded by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf and his friends, who turn up every now and then for some shooting practice.   The trap and skeet shooting club from UD also turned in a second place finish in October at Virginia Tech's Hokie Invitational in Bluefield, Va., where they beat out four other teams in the group's first collegiate competition.    Liz Clark, a senior hotel, restaurant and institutional management major from Pittsford, N.Y., also began trap shooting with family members in the Rochester area.   “Once you get out there, it really is addictive,” Clark said. “Once you get out there, you want to do more of it. It's almost like golf.”   Andrew Engle, a junior history major from Hockessin and vice president of the trap and skeet shooting club, is a two-time Delaware state champion. He gained interest in the sport from his grandfather, who has been shooting trap and skeet for more than 40 years.   “I got involved with my grandfather, and the rest is history,” Engel said. “It's a lot of fun, and I have met a lot of friends from coast to coast and from Michigan to Texas.”   Engel said that training includes working on eye-hand coordination and core strengthening exercises to prepare for competitions that can last for several hours.   “The shotguns weigh from seven to 10 pounds,” Engel said. “You need strength to hold a gun all day during competition.”   Bill Trone, president of the Wilmington Trapshooting Association, said that years ago trap shooting used to be more popular than baseball in terms of attracting spectators.   “Twenty-five years ago they used to hold a state shooting championship,” Trone said. “It may be coming back a little, because people in the area are learning about us.”   Faculty adviser John Courtright, faculty director of the Associate in Arts Program and a professor in the Department of Communication, said he began shooting while growing up in his native Iowa.   “I like to shoot, and I like students, so I figured I had something to offer the group,” Courtright said. “My role is to get to know the students and for them to get to know me.”    Article by Jerry Rhodes  Photos by Tyler Jacobson       Subscribe to UDaily  |  Subscribe to crime alert notification                      close          University of Delaware "" Newark, DE 19716 "" USA "" Phone: (302) 831-2792 ""  2008   Comments | Contact Us | Legal Notices                    "
