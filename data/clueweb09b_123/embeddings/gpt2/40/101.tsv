Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

clueweb09-enwp03-36-09546	"                     University of North Carolina Press          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  UNC Press )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  University of North Carolina Press  (or  UNC Press ), founded in 1922, is a  university press  that is part of the  University of North Carolina .   The University of North Carolina Press (or UNC Press) is a university press that is part of the University of North Carolina. The Press is a member of the American Association of University Presses (AAUP) and the Green Press Initiative.   In 1922, on the campus of the nation's oldest state university, thirteen faculty members and trustees met to charter a publishing house. Their creation, the University of North Carolina Press, was the first university press in the South and one of the first in the nation. From the start, UNC Press took a different, pioneering approach by creating one of the earliest and strongest regional publishing programs in the country. UNC Press was the first scholarly publisher to develop an ongoing program of books by and about African Americans, beginning in the late 1920s. By 1950, nearly 100 such volumes had appeared under its imprint. In the 1970s, UNC Press took an early lead in publishing feminist literary and historical works of distinction.   Notable UNC Press authors include historians such as John Hope Franklin, Edmund Morgan, Jacquelyn Dowd Hall, and Nell Irvin Painter; writers and critics such as Elizabeth Lawrence, Cleanth Brooks, and Paul Green; journalists such as Josephus Daniels and Lillian Smith; and local celebrities such as Mildred (Mama Dip) Council, Bland Simpson, David Stick, and Bill Neal. Scholars and archivists have lauded multi-volume documentary editions from UNC Press, such as  The Papers of John Marshall ,  The Papers of General Nathanael Greene ,  The Black Abolitionist Papers , and  The Complete Works of Captain John Smith . Acclaimed reference works such as the  Encyclopedia of Southern Culture  broke new ground and led to the publication of other city, state, and regional encyclopedias; and books like  North Carolina Architecture  and the  Dictionary of North Carolina Biography  have set a standard for regional reference works that other publishers now follow.   The Press today is a leader in exploring electronic publishing to make its titles available to libraries in non-print as well as traditional (ink-on-paper) formats. But no matter how timely the subject or how up-to-date the method of distribution, the highest standards in traditional book publishingfrom selection to presentationare always honored at UNC Press. And as a result, UNC Press is a benchmark against which many other university presses are measured.   In 2009 the UNC Press announced plans to bring back into print all of its out of print titles as print-on-demand titles through a series called Enduring Editions. These editions are published unaltered from the original and are presented in paperback formats, bringing both historical and cultural value to a new generation of scholars, students, and general readers.   Over the Presss eighty-year history the UNC Press has published more than 4,000 books. UNC Press books have won virtually every award imaginable, including the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the Bancroft Prize, and the Frederick Douglass Prize.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     Scholarships   Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill          Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       Athletics   Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels          Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         Rivalries   Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry   The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]  The school has an outdoor stone ampitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 103 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 104 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 105 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 106 ]     Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 107 ]     Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 108 ] [ 109 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 110 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 111 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 112 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 113 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     [ edit ]   Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       [ edit ]   Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         [ edit ]   Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     [ edit ]   Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         [ edit ]   Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     [ edit ]   Scholarships       Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill              Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       [ edit ]   Athletics       Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels              Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         [ edit ]   Rivalries       Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry       The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     [ edit ]   School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     [ edit ]   School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     [ edit ]   Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         [ edit ]   Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 101 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 102 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 103 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 104 ]     [ edit ]   Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 105 ]     [ edit ]   Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 106 ] [ 107 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 108 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 109 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 110 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 111 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

Endowment of foundations included in total.             The  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  ( UNC ,  North Carolina , or simply  Carolina ) [ 13 ]  is a  public  research university located in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , United States. The university is the oldest in, and  flagship  of, the  University of North Carolina  system. First enrolling students in 1795, UNC is the  oldest public university in the United States , and is one of the original eight schools known as a  Public Ivy .   Academically, all  undergraduates  receive a  liberal arts  education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university later in their undergraduate career. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as  BusinessWeek  and  U.S. News & World Report . Along with  Duke University  in  Durham  and  North Carolina State University  in  Raleigh , the university forms one of the corners of the  Research Triangle .   UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in  men's basketball  and  women's soccer . The  North Carolina Tar Heels  share rivalries with other  Tobacco Road  schools and have provided many  olympians  to  United States teams . The student newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  has won national awards for collegiate media, while the  student radio  station  WXYC  provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

[ 14 ]  Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is the oldest public university in the United States, and the only that awarded degrees in the eighteenth century. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   During the  Civil War ,  North Carolina Governor   David Lowry Swain  persuaded  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was among few in the  Confederacy  that managed to stay open. [ 17 ]  However, Chapel Hill still suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during  Reconstruction  from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875. [ 18 ]          The  Old Well , the university's most recognized landmark       Despite initial skepticism from university President  Frank Porter Graham , on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the  State College of Agriculture and Engineering  and the  Women's College  to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. [ 19 ]  In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully  coeducational . As a result, the Women's College was renamed the "" University of North Carolina at Greensboro ,"" and the University of North Carolina became the ""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."" [ 20 ]  Predating the other two schools by 98 years, UNC became the  de facto   flagship university  of the new statewide system. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 , protests about local  racial segregation  which began quietly in  Franklin Street  restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. [ 24 ]  The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963  Speaker Ban Law  prohibiting speeches by  communists  on state campuses in North Carolina. [ 25 ]  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor  William Brantley Aycock  and university President  William Friday , but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. [ 26 ]  Small amendments to allow ""infrequent"" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to  Marxist  speaker  Herbert Aptheker  and civil liberties activist  Frank Wilkinson ; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened ""Dan Moore's Wall"" by  The Daily Tar Heel  for Governor  Dan K. Moore . [ 27 ]  A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in  U.S. federal court , and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. [ 28 ]   From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the ""Carolina First"" fundraising campaign and an  endowment  that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  Professor  Oliver Smithies  was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Medicine  in 2007 for his work in  genetics . [ 31 ]   Notable  leaders of the university  include the 26th Governor of North Carolina,  David Lowry Swain  (president 1835-1868); and  Edwin Anderson Alderman  (1896-1900), who was also president of  Tulane University  and the  University of Virginia . [ 32 ]  The current chancellor is  Holden Thorp , appointed at the age of 43 after less than 1 year as Dean of Arts & Science. [ 33 ]     [ edit ]   Campus          Campus in the summer       UNC's sprawling and landscaped 729-acre (3.0 km 2 ) campus is dominated by two central  quads : Polk Place and McCorkle Place. [ 34 ]  Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President  James K. Polk , [ 35 ]  and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the  bill  requesting the university's  charter . [ 36 ]  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the  Pit Preacher . The Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the  American Society of Landscape Architects  Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university ""works of art"" by T.A. Gaines in his book  The Campus as a Work of Art . [ 34 ] [ 37 ]   The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as ""north campus,"" ""middle campus,"" and ""south campus."" North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls. [ 38 ]  Middle campus includes  Fetzer Field  and  Woollen Gymnasium  along with the Student Recreation Center,  Kenan Memorial Stadium , Irwin Belk outdoor track,  Eddie Smith Field House ,  Boshamer Stadium ,  Carmichael Auditorium , Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government,  School of Law ,  UNC Health Care , George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. [ 38 ]  South campus includes the  Dean Smith Center  for men's basketball,  Kenan-Flagler Business School , and the newest student residence halls. [ 38 ]          Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower       A new  satellite campus , Carolina North, to be built on the site of  Horace Williams Airport  was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a  research park  with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Old Well and McCorkle Place   The most enduring symbol of the university is the  Old Well , a small neoclassical  rotunda  based on the Temple of Love in the Garden of  Versailles , in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. [ 40 ]  The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings,  Old East , and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the  Davie Poplar  tree under which the university's founder,  William Richardson Davie , supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC. [ 41 ]  Due to the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as  Hurricane Fran  in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. [ 41 ]  The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's  bicentennial  celebration in 1993 by  President   Bill Clinton . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  Another university landmark is  Silent Sam , a statue commemorating soldiers who died fighting for the  Confederacy . The statue is controversial as some claim that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Others think that Silent Sam is simply a piece of the rich heritage of the  South . [ 44 ]  The statue of a soldier holding a gun is not fitted with any ammunition, therefore, it is a benign soldier. The ""unarmed"" soldier was erected to be a peaceful commemoration. The Morehead-Patterson bell tower was commissioned by  John Motley Morehead . [ 45 ]  He is also grandfather to the benefactor of the prestigious  Morehead Scholarship .       [ edit ]   Academics          South Building, administrative offices of the chancellor and College of Arts and Sciences         [ edit ]   Curriculum and honor code   UNC offers 71  bachelor's , 107  master's  and 74  doctoral degree  programs. [ 46 ]  The university enrolls more than 28,000 students from all 100  North Carolina counties , the other 49 states, and 47 other countries. State law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each  freshman  class meets or exceeds 82%. [ 47 ]   At the undergraduate level, students spend their first two years at UNC working to fulfill ""perspective"" requirements. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad  liberal arts  education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their  sophomore  year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication. [ 48 ]   The university has a longstanding  honor code  known as the ""Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,"" supplemented by an student-run honor court to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community. Faculty are forbidden to punish students caught cheating in any way, such as with failing grades, without permission of the court. [ 49 ]     [ edit ]   Libraries          Wilson Library viewed across Polk Place       UNC's library system, which comprises a number of individual libraries housed throughout its campus, holds more than 5.8 million volumes in total. [ 46 ]  UNC's North Carolina Collection is the largest collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. [ 50 ]  The library has an extensive Southern and rare book collection, housed in Wilson Library. The university is home to  ibiblio , one of the world's largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. [ 43 ]  The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located in the same general area. Wilson Library, which was the university's main library prior to the construction of Davis, now houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits. [ 53 ]          UNC School of Public Health         [ edit ]   Reputation and rankings   The university was named a  Public Ivy  by Richard Moll in his 1985 book  The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities , and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Many of UNC's professional schools have achieved high rankings in publications such as  Forbes Magazine , as well as annual  U.S. News & World Report  surveys. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  The business school's program was fifth ""Best Executive MBA"" by  BusinessWeek  in 2005. [ 58 ]  Other highly ranked schools include library and information studies, medicine, pharmacy, and public health. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  Nationally, UNC is in the top ten public universities for research. [ 63 ]   The undergraduate program has ranked in the top 30 in the United States by  U.S. News & World Report , and is consistently among the top five public universities, just behind  UC Berkeley ,  University of Virginia ,  UCLA , and the  University of Michigan . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]   Kiplinger's Personal Finance  has also ranked UNC as the number one ""best value"" public school for in-state students. [ 66 ]  Similarly, the university is first among public universities and ninth overall in ""Great Schools, Great Prices"", based on academic quality, net cost of attendance and average student debt. [ 67 ]  Along with one of the nation's most acclaimed undergraduate honors programs in a public institution, UNC also has the highest percentage of undergraduates studying abroad for any public institution. [ 46 ] [ 68 ]     [ edit ]   Scholarships       Main article:  Scholarships of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill              Graham Memorial in the fall       UNC has for decades offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the  Morehead Scholarship  (currently named the MoreheadCain Scholarship). Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 25 alumni of the program have been named  Rhodes Scholars . [ 69 ]  North Carolina also boasts the  Robertson Scholars Program , a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University. [ 70 ]  Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina Scholars program, which offers full scholarships for out-of-state students. [ 71 ]   In 2003, Chancellor  James Moeser  announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following  Princeton ) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.  [ 72 ]   North Carolina has the second largest number of Rhodes Scholars among public universities (43 since 1902) behind the  University of Virginia . [ 73 ]  Additionally, many students have won  Truman ,  Goldwater ,  Mitchell ,  Churchill ,  Fulbright ,  Marshall , Udall, and Mellon scholarships. [ 74 ]       [ edit ]   Athletics       Main article:  North Carolina Tar Heels              Tip-off of a basketball game against Duke at the Smith Center       The school sports teams participate in the  NCAA   Division I  Football Bowl Subdivision and  Atlantic Coast Conference . [ 11 ]  The NCAA refers to UNC as ""University of North Carolina"" for athletics. [ 8 ]  As of fall 2008, the university had won 34 NCAA team championships in six different sports, eighth all-time. These include nineteen NCAA championships in  women's soccer , five in  women's field hockey , four in men's lacrosse, four in  men's basketball , one in  women's basketball , and one in men's soccer. [ 75 ]  Other recent successes include three consecutive  College World Series  appearances by the  baseball team  from 2006 to 2008. [ 76 ]  In 1994, the university's athletic programs won the  Sears Directors Cup  ""all-sports national championship"" awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. [ 77 ]  Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include  Rachel Dawson  in field hockey;  Phil Ford ,  Tyler Hansbrough ,  Antawn Jamison , and  Michael Jordan  in men's basketball; and  Mia Hamm  (twice),  Shannon Higgins ,  Kristine Lilly , and  Tisha Venturini  in women's soccer. [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Mascot and nickname          Rameses at the 1957  Victory Bell  football game       The university's teams are nicknamed the "" Tar Heels ,"" in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a  tar  and  pitch  producer. [ 79 ]  The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the  American Civil War  and the  American Revolution . [ 79 ]  The mascot is a live  Dorset ram  named  Rameses , a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against  Virginia Military Institute , inspired by the play of former football player Jack "" The Battering Ram "" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. [ 80 ]  There is also an  anthropomorphic  ram mascot who appears at games. [ 81 ]  The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a  United States Navy  flight training program that was attached to the university during  World War II . [ 82 ]          Celebration on Franklin Street after victory over Duke         [ edit ]   Rivalries       Main articles:  Duke Rivalry  and  North Carolina State Rivalry       The  South's Oldest Rivalry  between North Carolina and its first opponent, the  University of Virginia , was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century. September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in  football  between the two teams. The bitterness of this rivalry has been superseded by somewhat less historical in-state competition with  Duke University ,  North Carolina State University , and  Wake Forest University . North Carolina's rivalry with Duke is particularly intense in  basketball . [ 83 ]  With a combined eight national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. As the two schools are located just eight miles (13 km) apart, the students and fans of both schools are focused in their mutual disdain. [ 84 ] [ 83 ]   Traditionally, the students exchange pranks with North Carolina State before major athletic competitions, such as painting their  Free Expression Tunnel  blue in 2006. [ 85 ]  In retaliation, NC State students travel to Chapel Hill and paint campus landmarks red. [ 86 ]  After important basketball victories, there is a tradition for students to rush downtown to  Franklin Street , which the police shut to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires. [ 87 ]     [ edit ]   School colors          Statue of Rameses near Kenan Memorial Stadium       Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been  Carolina blue  and white. [ 88 ]  The colors were chosen years before by the  Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies . The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the ""Di""s were from the western part of North Carolina while the ""Phi""s were from the eastern part of the state. Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the  UNC football  team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors. [ 89 ]     [ edit ]   School songs   Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as  commencement ,  convocation , and athletic games are the university  fight songs   I'm a Tar Heel Born  and  Here Comes Carolina . [ 90 ]  The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. [ 90 ]   Im a Tar Heel Born  originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's  alma mater ,  Hark The Sound . [ 90 ]     [ edit ]   Student life          Commencement (graduation) ceremony at Kenan Memorial Stadium         [ edit ]   Organizations and activities   Most student organizations at UNC are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the  student government  student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the student congress. [ 91 ]   The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the  North Carolina Children's Hospital . The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, as of 2008, had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999. [ 92 ]   The student run newspaper  The Daily Tar Heel  is ranked highly by  The Princeton Review , [ 93 ]  and received the 2004-05  National Pacemaker Award  from the  Associated Collegiate Press . [ 94 ]  Founded in 1977,  WXYC  89.3 FM is UNC's student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]  A student-run television station,  STV , airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill  Time Warner Cable  system. [ 97 ]          The Marching Tar Heels before a football game at Kenan Stadium       The athletic teams at the university are supported by the  Marching Tar Heels , the university's  marching band . The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller  pep bands  play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports. [ 98 ]  UNC has a  regional theater  company in residence, the  Playmakers Repertory Company , [ 99 ]  and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. [ 100 ]   Many  fraternities  and  sororities  on campus belong to the Pan-Hellenic Council, including Interfraternity Council, Greek Alliance Council, and  National Pan-Hellenic Council . Fifteen percent of undergraduates are Greek. [ 101 ]  UNC also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society. [ 102 ]   Student government at Carolina is composed of an executive branch headed by the student body president, a legislative branch composed of a student-elected student congress, and a judicial branch which includes the honor court and student supreme court. [ 103 ]  Student government authority derives from the Student Code, a document written and adopted in 1946 at the suggestion of Douglass Hunt. Prior to that time, the  Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies  along with other campus organizations supported student concerns. [ 104 ]     [ edit ]   Dining   Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. The new Rams Head Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It has one large dining area, two medium size dining areas, food service staff offices, kitchen, food preparation areas, storage and a Starbucks coffee shop. [ 105 ]     [ edit ]   Housing          Old East residence hall, built in 1793       On campus, the 33 residence halls are grouped into thirteen ""communities,"" varying from the Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes  Old East , the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. [ 106 ] [ 107 ]  Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also ""living-learning communities"" which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. [ 108 ]  An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates based on cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. [ 109 ]  Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. [ 110 ]  Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are  smoke-free . [ 111 ]  As of 2008, 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.

clueweb09-enwp01-96-14506	"                     University of North Carolina Press          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  University of North Carolina Press  (or  UNC Press ), founded in 1922, is a  university press  that is part of the  University of North Carolina .   The University of North Carolina Press (or UNC Press) is a university press that is part of the University of North Carolina. The Press is a member of the American Association of University Presses (AAUP) and the Green Press Initiative.   In 1922, on the campus of the nation's oldest state university, thirteen faculty members and trustees met to charter a publishing house. Their creation, the University of North Carolina Press, was the first university press in the South and one of the first in the nation. From the start, UNC Press took a different, pioneering approach by creating one of the earliest and strongest regional publishing programs in the country. UNC Press was the first scholarly publisher to develop an ongoing program of books by and about African Americans, beginning in the late 1920s. By 1950, nearly 100 such volumes had appeared under its imprint. In the 1970s, UNC Press took an early lead in publishing feminist literary and historical works of distinction.   Notable UNC Press authors include historians such as John Hope Franklin, Edmund Morgan, Jacquelyn Dowd Hall, and Nell Irvin Painter; writers and critics such as Elizabeth Lawrence, Cleanth Brooks, and Paul Green; journalists such as Josephus Daniels and Lillian Smith; and local celebrities such as Mildred (Mama Dip) Council, Bland Simpson, David Stick, and Bill Neal. Scholars and archivists have lauded multi-volume documentary editions from UNC Press, such as  The Papers of John Marshall ,  The Papers of General Nathanael Greene ,  The Black Abolitionist Papers , and  The Complete Works of Captain John Smith . Acclaimed reference works such as the  Encyclopedia of Southern Culture  broke new ground and led to the publication of other city, state, and regional encyclopedias; and books like  North Carolina Architecture  and the  Dictionary of North Carolina Biography  have set a standard for regional reference works that other publishers now follow.   The Press today is a leader in exploring electronic publishing to make its titles available to libraries in non-print as well as traditional (ink-on-paper) formats. But no matter how timely the subject or how up-to-date the method of distribution, the highest standards in traditional book publishingfrom selection to presentationare always honored at UNC Press. And as a result, UNC Press is a benchmark against which many other university presses are measured.   In 2009 the UNC Press announced plans to bring back into print all of its out of print titles as print-on-demand titles through a series called Enduring Editions. These editions are published unaltered from the original and are presented in paperback formats, bringing both historical and cultural value to a new generation of scholars, students, and general readers.   Over the Presss eighty-year history the UNC Press has published more than 4,000 books. UNC Press books have won virtually every award imaginable, including the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the Bancroft Prize, and the Frederick Douglass Prize.

In 1930 the school merged with the College of the City of Asheville (founded in 1928) to form  Biltmore Junior College . In 1934 the college was renamed  Biltmore College  and placed in the control of a board of trustees. 1936 brought both a further change of name to  Asheville-Biltmore College  and a transfer of power to the Asheville City School Board.   In 1961 Asheville-Biltmore College moved to the present UNCA campus in north Asheville. In 1963 it became a state-supported four-year college, and awarded its first bachelor's degrees in 1966. Its first residence halls were built in 1967. It adopted its current name in 1969 upon becoming part of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, since 1972 called the  University of North Carolina System . It is the designated public  liberal arts university  within that system, and has been classified as a Liberal Arts I institution since 1992.

(February 2008)              Police attack civil-rights marchers outside Selma, Alabama, on Bloody Sunday, March 7, 1965.              Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail sign.       The  Selma to Montgomery marches  were three marches in 1965 that marked the  political  and emotional peak of the  American civil rights movement . They were the culmination of the  voting rights  movement in  Selma ,  Alabama , launched by  Amelia Boynton  and her husband. Boynton brought many prominent leaders of the  American Civil Rights Movement  to Selma, including  James Bevel , who first called for the march;  Martin Luther King, Jr. ; and  Hosea Williams .   The first march took place on March 7, 1965  ""Bloody Sunday""  when 600  civil rights  marchers were attacked by state and local  police  with  billy clubs  and  tear gas . The second march took place on March 9. Only the third march, which began on March 21 and lasted five days, made it to  Montgomery , 54 miles (87 km) away.   The route is memorialized as the Selma To Montgomery Voting Rights Trail, a U.S.  National Historic Trail .           Contents       1   Struggle For the Vote: 19631964   2   First march     2.1   Goals of the march   2.2   Response to the March       3   Second march   4   Third march   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Struggle For the Vote: 19631964   Selma is the county seat and major town of  Dallas County, Alabama . In  1961 , the population of Dallas County was 57% black, but of the 15,000 blacks old enough to vote, only 130 were registered (fewer than 1%). At that time, more than 80% of Dallas County blacks lived below the poverty line, most of them working as  sharecroppers , farm hands, maids, janitors, and day-laborers. [ 1 ]   Led by the Boynton family (Amelia, Sam, and son Bruce), Rev. L.L. Anderson, J.L. Chestnut, and Marie Foster, the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL) attempted to register black citizens during the late 1950s and early 1960s. But their efforts were blocked by state and local officials, the  White Citizens' Council , and the  Ku Klux Klan . The methods included a  literacy test [ 2 ] , economic pressure, and violence.   In cooperation with the DCVL,  SNCC  members  Bernard  and Colia Lafayette began organizing around voter registration in Selma, Dallas County, and the surrounding  Black Belt  counties in early 1963. [ 3 ]  After  Sam Boynton  died in May, SNCC and DCVL called for a memorial service in his honor to promote voter registration. Sheriff Jim Clark surrounded Tabernacle Baptist Church with deputies to prevent them from discussing voter registration, but several hundred blacks defied his intimidation, and attended anyway. [ 4 ]   In mid-June, Bernard Lafayette was beaten and almost killed by  Klansmen  determined to prevent blacks from voting. When the Lafayettes returned to school in the fall, SNCC organizers Prathia Hall and Worth Long carried on their work despite arrests, beatings, and death threats. When 32 black school teachers applied to register as voters, they were immediately fired by the all-white school board. After the  Birmingham church bombing  in September, black students in Selma began  sit-ins  at local lunch counters where they were attacked and arrested. More than 300 were arrested in two weeks of protests, including SNCC Chairman  John Lewis . [ 5 ]   October 7, 1963, was one of the two days per month that citizens were allowed to go to the courthouse to apply to register to vote. SNCC and the DCVL mobilized over 300 Dallas County blacks to line up at the voter registration office in what was called a ""Freedom Day"". Supporting them were author  James Baldwin  and his brother David, and comedian  Dick Gregory  and his wife Lillian, who was arrested for picketing. SNCC members who tried to bring water to the blacks waiting on line were arrested, as were those who held signs saying ""Register to Vote."" After waiting all day in the hot sun, only a handful of the hundreds in the line were allowed to fill out the voter application, and most of the applications were denied. [ 6 ]   In 1964, the  Civil Rights Act of 1964  made segregation illegal, yet  Jim Crow  remained in force. When attempts to integrate Selma dining and entertainment venues were resumed, blacks who tried to attend the movie theater and eat at a hamburger stand were beaten and arrested.   On July 6, 1964, John Lewis led 50 blacks to the courthouse on registration day but Sheriff Clark arrested them rather than allow them to apply to vote. On July 9, Judge James Hare issued an injunction forbidding any gathering of three or more people under the sponsorship of civil rights organizations or leaders. This injunction made it illegal to even talk to more than two people at a time about civil rights or voter registration in Selma, suppressing public civil rights activity there for six months. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   First march          Police wait for marchers to come across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday, March 7, 1965.       With civil rights activity blocked by Judge Hare's injunction, the DCVL requested the assistance of  Dr. King  and the  SCLC . Three of SCLC's main organizers  Director of Direct Action and Nonviolent Education  James Bevel ,  Diane Nash , and  James Orange   had been working on Bevel's Alabama Voting Rights Project since late 1963, a project which Dr. King and the executive board of SCLC had not joined. When SCLC officially accepted Amelia Boynton's invitation to bring their organization to Selma, Bevel, Nash, Orange and others in SCLC began working in Selma in December 1964. They also worked in the surrounding counties along with the SNCC staff who had been active there since early 1963.   The Selma Voting Rights Movement officially started on January 2, 1965, when Dr. King addressed a mass meeting in  Brown Chapel  in defiance of the anti-meeting injunction. Over the following weeks SCLC and SNCC activists expanded voter registration drives and protests in Selma and the adjacent  Black Belt  counties. Marches and other protests in support of voting rights were held in Selma,  Perry ,  Wilcox ,  Marengo ,  Greene , and  Hale  counties.   On  February 18 ,  1965 , an Alabama State Trooper, Corporal  James Bonard Fowler , shot  Jimmie Lee Jackson  as he tried to protect his mother and grandfather in a caf to which they had fled while being attacked by troopers during a nighttime civil rights demonstration in  Marion , county seat of Perry County. Jackson died eight days later, of an  infection  resulting from the gunshot wound, at Selma's Good Samaritan Hospital. [ 8 ]   In response, James Bevel called for a march from Selma-to-Montgomery, which occurred on  March 7 ,  1965  when 525 to 600 civil rights marchers headed east out of Selma on  U.S. Highway 80 .     [ edit ]   Goals of the march   James Bevel's initial plan was to march to Montgomery to ask Governor George Wallace if he had anything to do with ordering the lights turned out and the state troopers to shoot during the march in which Jackson was killed. Bevel called the march in order to focus the anger and pain of the people of Selma, some of whom wanted to address Jackson's death with violence, towards a nonviolent goal. The marchers also hoped to bring attention to the violations of their  rights  by marching to Montgomery. Dr. King agreed with Bevel's plan, and asked for a march from Selma to Montgomery to ask Governor  George Wallace  to protect black registrants.     [ edit ]   Response to the March   Wallace denounced the march as a threat to public safety and declared he would take all measures necessary to prevent it. The first march was led by  John Lewis  of SNCC and the Reverend  Hosea Williams  of SCLC, followed by Bob Mants of SNCC and Albert Turner of SCLC. They made it only as far as the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , six blocks away.  State troopers  and the  Dallas County  Sheriff's Department, some mounted on horseback, awaited them. In the presence of the  news media , the lawmen attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs, tear gas, and bull whips.   Brutal televised images of the attack, which presented people with horrifying images of marchers left bloodied and severely injured, roused support for the U.S. civil rights movement.  Amelia Boynton  was beaten and gassed nearly to death; her photo appeared on the front page of newspapers and news magazines around the world. Seventeen marchers were hospitalized, leading to the naming of the day ""Bloody Sunday"".     [ edit ]   Second march   Immediately after ""Bloody Sunday"",  Martin Luther King Jr.  began organizing a second march to be held on Tuesday,  March 9 ,  1965 , calling for people across the country to join him. Hundreds of people responded to his call, shocked by what they had seen on television.   To prevent another outbreak of violence, the marchers attempted to gain a  court order  that would prohibit the police from interfering. Instead of issuing the court order, Federal District Court Judge  Frank Minis Johnson  issued a  restraining order , preventing the march from taking place until he could hold additional hearings later in the week.   SCLC knew that Judge Johnson would eventually lift the restraining order and they did not want to alienate one of the few southern judges who was often sympathetic to their cause by violating his injunction. But movement supporters, both local and from around the country, were determined to march in protest against ""Bloody Sunday"" and the systematic denial of black voting rights in Alabama. To balance these conflicting imperatives, SCLC decided to hold a partial ""ceremonial"" march that would cross over the bridge but halt when ordered to do so in compliance with the injunction.   On March 9, Dr. King led about 2,500 marchers out to the Edmund Pettus Bridge and held a short prayer session before turning the marchers back around, thereby not breaking the court order preventing them from marching all the way to Montgomery. Only the  SCLC  leaders were told of this plan in advance, causing some consternation among the marchers, many of whom had traveled long distances to join the march. King asked the crowd to remain in Selma for another attempt at the march once the injunction was lifted.   That evening, three white ministers who had come for the march were attacked and beaten with clubs in front of the Silver Moon Caf, a  hangout  for  segregationist  whites. The worst injured was  James Reeb , a white  Unitarian Universalist  minister from  Boston . Selma's public hospital refused to treat Rev. Reeb, who had to be taken to University Hospital in  Birmingham , two hours away. Reeb died on Thursday,  March 11  at University Hospital with his wife by his side.   Blacks in Dallas County and the Black Belt mourned the death of Rev. Reeb as they had earlier mourned the death of Jimmy Lee Jackson. But many activists were bitter that the media and national political leaders expressed great concern over Reeb's murder, but had paid scant attention to the killing of Jimmy Lee Jackson.  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  spokesman  Stokely Carmichael  was reported as saying "" What you want is the nation to be upset when anybody is killed but it almost [seems that] for this to be recognized, a white person must be killed .""     [ edit ]   Third march   A week after Reeb's death, Judge Johnson ruled in favor of the  First Amendment  rights of blacks to march in protest and against the state of Alabama from blocking them:     The law is clear that the  right to petition  one's government for the redress of grievances may be exercised in large groups . . . . These rights may . . . be exercised by marching, even along public highways.   Williams v. Wallace , 240 F. Supp. 100, 106 (M.D. Ala. 1960).     The five-day, four-night march began on March 21, and covered a 54-mile (87 km) route along  U.S. Route 80  (in Alabama known as the ""Jefferson Davis Highway""). Protected by 2,000 soldiers of the U.S. Army, 1,900 members of the Alabama National Guard under Federal command, and many FBI agents and Federal Marshals, the marchers averaged ten miles (16 km) a day and arrived in Montgomery on the 24th, and the Alabama Capitol building on the 25th. [ 9 ]   On March 21st, close to 8,000 people assembled at Brown Chapel to commence the trek to Montgomery. [ 10 ]  Most of them were black, but also participating were a significant number of whites along with some Asians and Latinos. In 1965, the road to Montgomery was four lanes wide going east from Selma, then narrowed to two lanes through  Lowndes County , and then widened to four lanes again at Montgomery county border. Under the terms of Judge Johnson's order, the march was limited to no more than 300 participants for the two days they were on the two-lane portion of Highway-80, so at the end of the first day most of the marchers returned to Selma by bus and car, leaving 300 to camp overnight and take up the journey the next day.   On March 22nd and 23rd, 300 protesters marched through chilling rain across Lowndes county, camping at three sites in muddy fields. At the time of the march, the population of Lowndes County was 81% Black and 19% white, but not a single black was registered to vote. [ 11 ]  At the same time there were 2240 whites registered to vote in Lowndes County, a figure that represented 118% of the adult white population (in many southern counties of that era it was common practice to retain white voters on the rolls after they died or moved away).   On the morning of 24th, the march crossed into Montgomery County and the highway widened again to four lanes. All day as the march approached the city, additional marchers were ferried by bus and car to join the line. By evening, several thousand marchers had reached the final campsite at the City of St. Jude, a  Catholic  complex, on the outskirts of Montgomery.   That night on a makeshift stage, a ""Stars for Freedom"" rally was held, with singers  Harry Belafonte ,  Tony Bennett ,  Frankie Laine ,  Peter, Paul and Mary ,  Sammy Davis, Jr.  and  Nina Simone  all performing.   On Thursday,  March 25 , 25,000 people marched from St. Jude to the steps of the  State Capitol Building  where King delivered the speech "" How Long, Not Long ."" "" The end we seek, "" King told the crowd, "" is a society at peace with itself, a society that can live with its conscience. ... I know you are asking today, How long will it take? I come to say to you this afternoon however difficult the moment, however frustrating the hour, it will not be long. "" [ 12 ]   Later that night,  Viola Liuzzo , a white mother of five from Detroit who had come to Alabama to support voting rights for blacks, was assasinated by  Ku Klux Klan  members while she was ferrying marchers back to Selma from Montgomery. Among the Klansmen in the car from which the shots were fired was FBI informant Gary Rowe. Afterward, the FBI's  COINTELPRO  operation spread false rumors that Liuzzo was a member of the  Communist Party  and abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African Americans involved in the civil rights movement. [ 13 ]   The March to Montgomery had a significant impact on public opinion. Within five months of the third march, President  Lyndon Johnson  signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6th at a ceremony attended by many civil rights leaders and activists, including Amelia Boynton of Selma. This act prohibited most of the unfair practices used to prevent blacks from registering to vote, and provided for federal registrars to go to Alabama and other states with a history of voting-related discrimination to ensure that the law was implemented. In 1960, there were only 53,336 black voters in Alabama, by 1990 this number had risen to 537,285. [ 14 ]  In Selma, with more than 7,000 blacks added to the voting rolls Sheriff Jim Clark was voted out of office in 1966 (he later served a prison sentence for drug-smuggling).

clueweb09-enwp01-90-09210	"                     Tennessee in the American Civil War          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    Confederate States  in the   American Civil War         South Carolina   Mississippi   Florida   Alabama   Georgia   Louisiana   Texas   Virginia   Arkansas   North Carolina   Tennessee         Dual governments         Kentucky   Missouri         Border states         Delaware   Maryland   West Virginia         Claimed territories         Indian Territory   New Mexico   Arizona         To a large extent, the  American Civil War  was fought in cities and farms of  Tennessee ; only Virginia saw more battles. Tennessee was the last of the  Southern states  to  secede  from the  Union , but saw more than its share of the devastation resulting from years of warring armies criss-crossing the state. Its rivers were key arteries to the  Deep South , and, from the early days of the war, Union efforts focused on securing control of those transportation routes, as well as major roads and mountain passes such as the  Cumberland Gap .   A large number of important battles occurred in Tennessee, including the vicious fighting at the  Battle of Shiloh , which at the time, was the deadliest battle in American history (it was later surpassed by a number of other engagements). Other large battles in Tennessee included  Stones River ,  Chattanooga ,  Nashville , and  Franklin .   Although the state became a part of the Confederacy, pockets of strong pro-Union sentiments remained throughout the war, particularly in the mountains in  East Tennessee . The  Vice President of the United States ,  Andrew Johnson , was a loyalist, as were a number of congressmen and state politicians. On the Confederate side, significant leaders included noted cavalryman  Nathan B. Forrest  and corps commanders  Leonidas Polk  and  Benjamin F.

Initially, most Tennesseans showed little enthusiasm for breaking away from a nation whose struggles it had shared for so long. In 1860, they had voted by a slim margin for the  Constitutional Unionist   John Bell , a native son and moderate who continued to search for a way out of the crisis.   A vocal minority of Tennesseans spoke critically of the Northern states and the Lincoln presidency. ""The people of the South are preparing for their next highest duty  resistance to coercion or invasion,"" wrote the Nashville  Daily Gazette  on  January 5 ,  1861 . The newspaper expressed the view that Florida, Georgia, and Alabama were exercising the highest right of all by taking control of all  forts  and other military establishments within the area  the right to self-defense. [ 1 ]  A pro-secessionist proposal was made in the Memphis  Appeal  to build a fort at  Randolph, Tennessee , on the  Mississippi River . [ 2 ]   Governor  Isham G. Harris  convened an emergency session of the  Tennessee General Assembly  in January 1861. During his speech before the legislative body on January 7, he described the secession of the Southern states as a crisis caused by ""long continued agitation of the slavery question"" and ""actual and threatened aggressions of the Northern States ... upon the well-defined constitutions rights of the Southern citizen."" He also expressed alarm at the growth of the ""purely sectional"" Republican Party, which he stated was bound together by the ""uncompromising hostility to the rights and institutions of the fifteen Southern states."" He identified numerous grievances with the Republican Party, blaming them for inducing slaves to run off by means of the  Underground Railroad ,  John Brown 's raids, and high taxes on slave labor. [ 3 ]   Harris agreed with the idea of popular sovereignty, that only the people within a state can determine whether or not slavery could exist within the boundaries of that state. Furthermore, he regarded laws passed by Congress that made U.S. territories non-slave states as taking territories away from the American people and making them solely for the North, territories from which ""Southern men unable to live under a government which may by law recognize the free negro as his equal"" were excluded. Governor Harris proposed holding a State Convention. A series of resolutions were presented in the  Tennessee House of Representatives  by  William H. Wisener  against the proposal. He declared passing any law reorganizing and arming the state militia to be inexpedient.   In Memphis, Unionists held two torchlight processions to honor their cause. The secessionists replied with their own demonstrations and a celebratory ball. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] That week, on February 9, the state of Tennessee was to vote on whether or not to send delegates to a State Convention that would decide on secession. [ 6 ]  The General Assembly convened by Governor Isham Harris did not believe it had the authority to call a State Convention without a vote of the people. [ 7 ]   In February 1861, 54 percent of the states voters voted against sending delegates to a secession convention, defeating the proposal for a State Convention by a vote of 69,675 to 57,798. If a State Convention had been held, it would have been very heavily pro-Union. 88,803 votes were cast for Unionist candidates and 22,749 votes were cast for Secession candidates. [ 8 ]  That day the American flag was displayed in ""every section of the city,"" with zeal equal to that which existed during the late 1860 presidential campaign, wrote the Nashville  Daily Gazette . [ 9 ]  On the corner across from the newspaper office, a crowd had gathered around a bagpipe player playing  Yankee Doodle , after which ex-mayor John Hugh Smith gave a speech that was received with loud cheers. [ 10 ]   In a letter to Democratic senator  Andrew Johnson , his servant C.O. Faxon surmised that the margin by which the No Convention vote won would have been even greater, had Union men not been afraid that if a State Convention were not called then, then Isham Harris would have again called for a State Convention when more state legislators were ""infected with the secession epidemic."" [ 11 ]   On  March 7 , the Memphis  Daily Appeal  wrote that the abolitionists were attempting to deprive the South of territories won during the  U.S.-Mexican War . It used the argument that the slave states had furnished twice as many volunteers as the free states and territories, but it did not note that slave states were the ones who had supported the war. [ 12 ]   On March 19, the editors of the Clarksville  Chronicle  endorsed a pro-Union candidate for state senator in Robertson, Montgomery, and Stewart counties.  [ 13 ]   On April 12, the Memphis  Daily Appeal  ran a satirical obituary for  Uncle Sam , proclaiming him to have died of ""irrepressible conflict disease,"" after having met Abraham Lincoln. [ 14 ]  One  Robertson County  slave owner complained that she could not rent her slaves out for ""half [of what] they were worth"" because ""the negros think when Lincoln takes his last, they will all be free."" [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Reaction to the attack on Fort Sumter   With the attack on  Fort Sumter  on  April 12 ,  1861 , followed by President  Abraham Lincoln s call for 75,000 volunteers to put the seceded states back into line, public sentiment turned dramatically against the Union.   Historian Daniel Crofts thus reports:     Unionists of all descriptions, both those who became Confederates and those who did not, considered the proclamation calling for seventy-five thousand troops ""disastrous."" Having consulted personally with Lincoln in March, Congressman  Horace Maynard , the unconditional Unionist and future Republican from East Tennessee, felt assured that the administration would pursue a peaceful policy. Soon after  April 15 , a dismayed Maynard reported that ""the President's extraordinary proclamation"" had unleashed ""a tornado of excitement that seems likely to sweep us all away."" Men who had ""heretofore been cool, firm and Union loving"" had become ""perfectly wild"" and were ""aroused to a phrenzy of passion."" For what purpose, they asked, could such an army be wanted ""but to invade, overrun and subjugate the Southern states."" The growing war spirit in the North further convinced southerners that they would have to ""fight for our hearthstones and the security of home.""   [ 16 ]     Governor  Isham Harris  began military mobilization, submitted an  ordinance  of  secession  to the  General Assembly , and made direct overtures to the  Confederate  government.     [ edit ]   Tennessee secedes   In a  June 8 ,  1861  referendum, East Tennessee held firm against separation, while  West Tennessee  returned an equally heavy majority in favor. The deciding vote came in  Middle Tennessee , which went from 51 percent against secession in February to 88 percent in favor in June.   Having ratified by popular vote its connection with the fledgling  Confederacy , Tennessee became the last state to withdraw from the Union.   People in East Tennessee, the only area of the state that did not practice slavery on a wide scale, continued to be firmly against Tennessee's move to leave the Union, as were many in other parts of the state, particularly in historically Whig portions of West Tennessee. [ 17 ]  Tennesseans representing twenty-six East Tennessee counties met twice in Greeneville and Knoxville and agreed to secede from Tennessee. They petitioned the state legislature in Nashville, which denied their request to secede and sent Confederate troops under  Felix Zollicoffer  to occupy East Tennessee and prevent secession. East Tennessee supplied significant quantities of troops for the Federal army, while the rest of Tennessee was a prime recruiting area for the Confederate army.  (See also  Nickajack ).  Many East Tennesseans engaged in guerrilla warfare against state authorities by burning bridges, cutting telegraph wires, and spying. [ 18 ]  East Tennessee became an early base for the  Republican Party .     [ edit ]   Battles          The Third Battle of Chattanooga was fought November 23-25, 1863.       Many battles were fought in the state, most of them Union victories.     [ edit ]   Twin Rivers Campaign of 1862   Control of the  Cumberland  and  Tennessee Rivers  was important in gaining control of Tennessee during the age of  steamboats . Tennessee relied on northbound riverboats to receive staple commodities from the Cumberland and Tennessee valleys. [ 19 ]  The idea of using the rivers to breach the Confederate defense line in the West was well-known by the end of 1861; Union gunboats had been scanning Confederate fort-building on the twin rivers for months before the campaign. [ 20 ]   Ulysses S. Grant  and the  United States Navy  captured control of the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers in February 1862 and held off the  Confederate  counterattack at  Shiloh  in April of the same year.     [ edit ]   Capture of Memphis   Capture of  Memphis  and  Nashville  gave the Union control of the Western and Middle  sections . Control was confirmed at the battle of  Murfreesboro  in early January 1863.   After Nashville was captured (the first Confederate state capital to fall) Andrew Johnson, an East Tennessean from  Greeneville , was appointed military governor of the state by Lincoln. During this time, the military government abolished  slavery .   The Confederates continued to hold East Tennessee despite the strength of Unionist sentiment there, with the exception of pro-Confederate  Sullivan County .     [ edit ]   Fall 1863   The Confederates besieged  Chattanooga  in early fall 1863 but were driven off by Grant in November. Many of the Confederate defeats can be attributed to the poor strategic vision of General  Braxton Bragg , who led the  Army of Tennessee  from  Shiloh  to Confederate defeat at Chattanooga.     [ edit ]   Fall 1864   The last major battles came when the Confederates invaded in November 1864 and were checked at  Franklin , then totally destroyed by  George Thomas  at Nashville in December.

Harris               [ edit ]   Reconstruction   After the war, Tennessee adopted a constitutional amendment forbidding property in men  February 22 ,  1865 ; [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  ratified the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  on  July 18 ,  1866 ; and was the first state readmitted to the Union on  July 24 ,  1866 .   Because it ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, Tennessee was the only state that seceded from the Union that did not have a military governor during  Reconstruction . That did not placate people who could not accept the results of the war. Many whites resisted efforts to expand suffrage and other civil rights to freedmen. During slavery whites had convinced themselves that the institution was justified. Some whites could not concede to a world in which former slaves should have equal rights under the law. Like many other peoples defeated in war, they were unwilling to give up any of the power they formerly held.   When, in 1867, the state Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of African American suffrage, some groups grew more agitated. The  Nashville Republican Banner  on  January 4 ,  1868 , published an editorial calling for a revolutionary movement of white Southerners to unseat the one-party state rule of the  Republican Party  and restore the racial subjugation of the region's blacks.   ""In this State,"" the paper argued, ""reconstruction has perfected itself and done its worst. It has organized a government which is as complete a closed corporation as may be found; it has placed the black man over the white as the agent and prime-move of domination; it has constructed a system of machinery by which all free guarantees, privileges and opportunities are removed from the people.... The impossibility of casting a free vote in Tennessee short of a revolutionary movement ... is an undoubted fact.""   The  Banner  urged readers to ignore the presidential election and instead put energies into building ""a local movement here at home"" that would end Republican rule. [ 23 ]   The frenzied nature of this account can be seen with the perspective of some facts: according to the 1860 census, African Americans comprised only 25% of the state's population in 1860, so they could not dominate politics. Two or three blacks served in the Tennessee legislature during Reconstruction, while more served as state and city officers. The editors of the Nashville  Banner  may have been reacting to increased participation by African Americans on the city council, but the maximum number of seats they held was about one-third.

Having  fought past Forts Jackson and St. Philip , the Union capture of the city itself was unopposed, sparing the destruction suffered by many other  Southern  cities. However, a firm and severe administration of the city by its military governor caused lasting resentment. This capture of the largest  Confederate  city was a major  turning point  and an incident of international importance.           Contents       1   Background   2   Battle   3   Aftermath   4   See also   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Background   Part of  Winfield Scott 's "" Anaconda Plan "" called for the division of the Confederacy by seizing control of the Mississippi River. One of the first steps in such operations was to enter the mouth of the Mississippi River, ascend to New Orleans and capture the city, closing off the entrance to Rebel ships. In mid-January 1862, Flag Officer  David G. Farragut  undertook this enterprise with his  West Gulf Blockading Squadron . The way was soon open except for the two masonry forts,  Jackson  and  St. Philip , above the  Head of Passes , approximately seventy miles below New Orleans.   From April 18 to April 28, Farragut bombarded and then fought his way past the forts in the  Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip , managing to get thirteen ships up river on April 24.     [ edit ]   Battle   At noon on April 25, Farragut anchored in front of New Orleans; Forts Jackson and St. Philip, isolated and continuously bombarded by the mortar boats, surrendered on April 28. Soon afterwards soldiers under  Maj. Gen.   Benjamin Butler  occupied the city, which surrendered without fighting. The Union forces engraved ""The Union Must and Shall Be Preserved"" on the statue of  Andrew Jackson  that honored him for the  Battle of New Orleans  in the  War of 1812 .     [ edit ]   Aftermath   Butler became the military governor of the city and in his administration he showed great firmness and severity. New Orleans was unusually healthy and orderly during the Butler regime. Many of his acts, however, gave great offense, such as the seizure of $800,000 that had been deposited in the office of the  Dutch   consul  and his imprisonment of the French  Champagne  magnate  Charles Heidsieck . Most notorious was  Butler's General Order No. 28  of May 15, issued after some provocation, that if any woman should insult or show contempt for any officer or soldier of the United States, she shall be regarded and shall be held liable to be treated as a ""woman of the town plying her avocation"", i.e., a  prostitute . This order provoked protests both in the  North  and the  South , and also abroad, particularly in England and France, and it was doubtless the cause of his removal from command of the  Department of the Gulf  on December 17, 1862. He was nicknamed ""Beast Butler,"" and ""Spoons,"" for his alleged habit of pilfering the silverware of Southern homes in which he stayed.   On June 7, he executed one  William B. Mumford , who had torn down a  United States flag  placed by Farragut on the New Orleans Mint; for this execution, he was denounced in December 1862 by  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  in General Order 111 as a  felon  deserving  capital punishment , who if captured should be reserved for execution. Butler's administration did have benefits to the city, which was kept both orderly and healthy. Towards the end of the war Maj. Gen.  Nathaniel Banks  held the command at New Orleans.

By the end of the Civil War,  Missouri  had supplied nearly 110,000 troops for the  Union Army  and about 40,000 troops for the  Confederate Army . There were battles and skirmishes in all areas of the state, from the  Iowa  and  Illinois  border in the northeast to the edge of the state in the southeast and southwest on the  Arkansas  border. Counting minor engagements, actions and skirmishes, Missouri saw over 1,200 distinct fights. Only  Virginia  and  Tennessee  exceeded Missouri in the number of clashes within the state boundaries.   The biggest battle in the war west of the  Mississippi River  was the  Battle of Westport  at  Kansas City  in 1864.

Missouri entered the  Union  in 1821 as a  slave state  following the  Missouri Compromise of 1820 , in which it was agreed that no state north of Missouri's southern border with  Arkansas  could enter the Union as a slave state.  Maine  entered the Union as a  free state  in the compromise to balance Missouri.     [ edit ]   Bleeding Kansas       Main article:  Bleeding Kansas       One of the biggest areas of concerns for Missouri slave-holders was a Federal law that decreed that if a slave physically entered a free state, he or she was free. The  Underground Railroad , in which slaves gained their freedom by heading north, was already becoming established in the state. The slaveholders were particularly concerned about the prospects of the entire western border becoming a conduit for the Underground Railroad if those new states entered the U.S. as free states. In 1854 the  Kansas-Nebraska Act  nullified the Missouri Compromise and said the two states could decide on their own whether to enter as a free or slave state. The result was a de facto war between pro-slavery residents of Missouri (called  Border Ruffians ) and Kansas free staters to influence how Kansas entered the Union. Most of these conflicts involved attacks and murders of individuals on both sides, with the  Sacking of Lawrence  by pro-slavery forces and the  Pottawatomie Massacre  by  John Brown ) being the most notable. Kansas initially approved a pro-slavery constitution called the  Lecompton Constitution , but, after the U.S. Congress rejected it, the state approved a free-state  Wyandotte Constitution .          Old Courthouse in St. Louis where the Dred Scott case was argued         [ edit ]   Dred Scott Decision       Main article:  Dred Scott Decision       Against the background of Bleeding Kansas, the case of  Dred Scott , a slave who in 1846 sued in  St. Louis, Missouri , for his freedom because he had been taken to a free state, reached the  U.S. Supreme Court . The Court in 1857 ruled that slaves would not be free simply if they entered a free state, negating the earlier Federal law. While the decision helped calm the skirmishes between Missouri and Kansas residents, it was to enrage  abolitionists  and ratchet up the vitriolic rhetoric that was to lead to the war.     [ edit ]   Pony Express       Main article:  Pony Express              Ulysses S. Grant       With war storm clouds brewing in 1860, the government sought to communicate more quickly with  San Francisco, California . In 1860 it took 25 days for a message to reach the coast from Missouri. The firm of  Russell, Majors and Waddell  proposed to do it in 10 days with a relay system of horses from what was then the furthest west terminus of a railroad at  St. Joseph, Missouri . The resulting  Pony Express  began operations on  April 3 ,  1860 .  Ulysses S. Grant 's first commission in the Civil War was to protect the  Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad , which was delivering its mail.     [ edit ]   Armed neutrality   By 1860, Missouri's initial southern settlers had been supplanted with a more diversified non-slave holding population, including many  German  and  Irish  immigrants. With war seeming inevitable, Missouri thought it could stay out of the conflict by remaining in the Union, but staying neutralnot giving men or supplies to either side and pledging to fight troops from either side who entered the state. The policy was first put forth in 1860 by outgoing Governor  Robert Marcellus Stewart , who had Northern leanings. It was reaffirmed by incoming Governor  Claiborne Jackson , who had Southern leanings. A  Constitutional Convention  to discuss  secession  was convened with  Sterling Price  presiding. The delegates voted to stay in the Union and supported the neutrality position.          Presidential electoral votes by state in 1860.       In the  United States presidential election, 1860 ,  Abraham Lincoln  received only 10 percent of the state's votes, while 71 percent favored either  John Bell  or  Stephen A. Douglas , both of whom wanted the status quo to remain (Douglas was to narrowly win the Missouri vote over Bellthe only state Douglas carried) with the remaining 19 percent siding with Southern  Democrat   John C. Breckinridge .     [ edit ]   Missouri demographics in 1860   According to the  1860 U.S. Census , Missouri's total population was 1,182,012, of which 114,931 (9.7%) were slaves. Most of the slaves were in rural areas rather than cities.   Of the 299,701 responses to ""Occupation"", 124,989 listed ""Farmers"" and 39,396 listed ""Farm Laborers."" The next highest categories were ""laborers"" (30,668), ""Blacksmith"" (4,349), and Merchants (4,245).   Less than half the state was listed as native born (475,246, or 40%). Those coming from other states listed: Kentucky (99,814), Tennessee (73,504), Virginia (53,937), Ohio (35,380), Indiana (30,463), and Illinois (30,138), with lesser amounts from other states.   906,540 (77%) were listed as being born in the United States. Of the 160,541 foreign born, residents came from the German states (88,487), Ireland (43,481), England (10,009), France (5,283), and Switzerland (4,585), with lesser amounts from other countries.

[ edit ]   Eviction of Governor Jackson          Claiborne Fox Jackson         [ edit ]   Camp Jackson Affair          Sterling Price           Main articles:  Camp Jackson Affair  ,  Missouri State Guard , and  Price-Harney Truce       Missouri's neutrality was tested in a conflict of over the  St. Louis Arsenal . The Union Army under  Nathaniel Lyon  seized the arsenal and moved its supplies to Illinois. At the same time, Governor Jackson called up the Missouri State Militia under  Brig. Gen.   Daniel M. Frost  for maneuvers in suburban St. Louis at Camp Jackson. These maneuvers were perceived by Lyon as an attempt to seize the arsenal. On  May 10 ,  1861 , Lyon attacked the militia and paraded them as captives through the streets of St. Louis and a riot erupted. Lyon's troops, comprised mainly of German immigrants, opened fire on the attacking crowd killing 28 and injuring 100.   The next day, the Missouri General Assembly authorized the formation of a  Missouri State Guard  with Sterling Price as its commander to resist invasions from either side (but initially from the Union army).  William S. Harney , Federal commander of the  Department of the West , moved to quiet the situation by agreeing to the Missouri neutrality in the  Price-Harney Truce . However Abraham Lincoln overruled the truce agreement and relieved Harney of command and replaced him with Lyon. On  June 11 ,  1861 , Lyon, in a meeting with Jackson, demanded that Missouri honor Lincoln's demand for troops from the state. Jackson refused and Lyon said he would enforce the order. After Jackson was escorted from the lines, Lyon began a pursuit of Jackson and Price and his elected state government through the  Battle of Boonville  and  Battle of Carthage (1861) . Jackson and the pro-Confederate politicians fled the state and set up a government-in-exile recognized by the Confederacy, but powerless inside Missouri.     [ edit ]   Union provisional government   On  July 22 ,  1861 , following Lyon's capture of the Missouri capital at  Jefferson City , the  Missouri Constitutional Convention  reconvened and declared the Missouri governor's office to be vacant. On  July 28 , it appointed  Hamilton Rowan Gamble  as governor of the state and agreed to comply with Lincoln's demand for troops.     [ edit ]   Battle of Wilson's Creek          Nathaniel Lyon           Main article:  Battle of Wilson's Creek       The biggest battle in the campaign to evict Jackson was the  Battle of Wilson's Creek  near  Springfield, Missouri , on  August 10 ,  1861 . The battle marked the first time that the Missourians had sought formal help from the  Confederate States of America . There were more than 2,300 casualties on the Union side, including Lyon who was fatally shot. The Confederates lost 1,100 men. Although Price's army won the battle, he did not pursue the retreating Federals. Subsequently, he launched an invasion into northwestern Missouri to recapture the state, culminating in the  Battle of Liberty  on  September 17 . Thereafter, Price began a withdrawal of the main Missouri State Guard units from the state.   Small remnants of the Missouri Guard remained in the state and fought isolated battles throughout the war. Price soon came under the command and control of the Confederates. In March 1862, any hopes for a new offensive in Missouri were dimmed in the  Battle of Pea Ridge  just south of the border in Arkansas. The Missouri State Guard was to stay largely intact as a unit through the war and was to suffer heavy casualties in  Mississippi  in the  Battle of Iuka  and  Second Battle of Corinth .     [ edit ]   Fremont Emancipation   John C. Frmont  replaced Lyon as commander of the  Department of the West . Following the Wilson's Creek battle, he imposed  martial law  on the state and issued an order freeing the slaves of Missourians who were in rebellion.     ""The property, real and personal, of all persons in the State of Missouri who shall take up arms against the United States, and who shall be directly proven to have taken active part with their enemies in the field, is declared to be confiscated to the public use; and their slaves, if any they have, are hereby declared free."" [ 2 ]     This was not a general emancipation in the state as it did not extend to slaves owned by citizens who remained loyal. It did, however, exceed the  Confiscation Act of 1861  which only allowed the Unites States to claim ownership of the slave if the slave was proven to ""work or to be employed in or upon any fort, navy-yard, dock, armory, ship, intrenchment, or in any military or naval service whatsoever, against the Government and lawful authority of the United States."" [ 3 ]  Lincoln, fearing the emancipation would enrage neutral Missourians and slave states in Union control, granted Governor Gamble's request to rescind the emancipation and ease martial law.     [ edit ]   Confederate Government of Missouri       Main article:  Missouri secession       In October 1861, the remnants of the elected state government that favored the South (including Jackson and Price) met in  Neosho , and voted to formally secede from the Union. The measure gave them votes in the Confederate Congress, but otherwise was symbolic since they did not control any part of the state. The capital was to eventually move to  Marshall, Texas . When Jackson died in office in 1862, his  lieutenant governor ,  Thomas Caute Reynolds , succeeded him.     [ edit ]   Guerrilla warfare          William T. Anderson           Main article:  Bushwhacker       The Battle of Wilson's Creek was the last large scale engagement in the state until Price returned in 1864 in a last ditch attempt to capture the state. Between 1862 and 1864, the western parts endured  guerrilla warfare  in which southern partisan rangers and  Bushwhackers  battled the Kansas irregulars known as  Jayhawkers  and Redlegs or ""Redleggers"" (from the red gaiters they wore around their lower legs) and the allied Union forces. Although guerrilla warfare occurred throughout much of the state, most of the incidents occurred in northern Missouri and were characterized by ambushes of individuals or families in rural areas. These incidents were particularly nefarious because their  vigilante  nature was outside the command and control of either side and often pitted neighbor against neighbor.   Among the more notorious incidents of guerrilla warfare were the  Sacking of Osceola , burning of Platte City and the  Centralia Massacre . Among the famous bushwhackers were  Quantrill's Raiders  and  Bloody Bill Anderson .           George Caleb Bingham  painting of General Order No. 11. In this famous propaganda work General Thomas Ewing is seated on a horse watching the Red Legs.         [ edit ]   General Order No. 11       Main article:  General Order  11 (1863)       In 1863 following the  Lawrence Massacre  in Kansas, Union General  Thomas Ewing, Jr.  accused farmers in rural Missouri of either instigating the attack or supporting it. He issued General Order No. 11 which forced the evacuation of all residents of rural areas of the four counties ( Jackson ,  Cass ,  Bates  and  Vernon ) south of the  Missouri River  on the Kansas border to leave their property, which was then burned. The order applied to farmers regardless of loyalty, although those who could prove their loyalty to the Union could stay in designated towns and those who could not were exiled entirely. Among those forced to leave were  Kansas City  founder  John Calvin McCoy  and its first mayor,  William S. Gregory .     [ edit ]   Price's Raid       Main article:  Price's Raid              Price's Raid in the Western Theater, 1864       With the Confederacy clearly losing the war in 1864, Sterling Price reassembled his Missouri Guard and launched a last gasp offensive to take Missouri. However, Price was unable to repeat his 1861 victorious campaigns in the state. Striking in the southeastern portion of the state, Price moved north, and attempted to capture  Fort Davidson  but failed. Next, Price sought to attack St. Louis but found it too heavily fortified and thus broke west in a parallel course with the Missouri River. The Federals attempted to retard Price's advance through both minor and substantial skirmishing such as at  Glasgow  and  Lexington . Price made his way to the extreme western portion of the state, taking part in a series of bitter battles at the  Little Blue ,  Independence , and  Byram's Ford . His Missouri campaign culminated in the  battle of Westport  in which over 30,000 troops fought, leading to the defeat of the Southern army. The Missourians retreated through  Kansas  and  Indian Territory  into Arkansas, where they stayed for the remainder of the war.     [ edit ]   Reconstruction       Main article:  James-Younger Gang              Jesse James       Since Missouri had remained in the Union, it did not suffer the worst aspects of  Reconstruction . The Democrats were to return to being the dominant power in the state by 1873. Newspapers in the state were vehement in their opposition to national  Radical Republican  policies. The outlaws  James-Younger gang  was to capitalize on this and become folk heroes as they robbed banks and trains while getting sympathetic press from the state's newspapersmost notably the  Kansas City Times .  Jesse James , who killed with bushwacker Bloody Bill Anderson at Centralia, was to excuse his murder of a resident of  Galltin , during a bank robbery, saying he thought he was killing Samuel P. Cox, who had hunted down Anderson after Centralia.     [ edit ]   References and notes       ^  Fulton, by far the current largest city was not listed in the printed list.

During the war, Georgia sent nearly 100,000 soldiers to battle, mostly to the armies in  Virginia . The state switched from  cotton  to food production, but severe transportation difficulties eventually restricted supplies. Early in the war, the state's 1,400 miles of railroad tracks provided a frequently used means of moving supplies and men, but by the middle of 1864, much of these lay in ruins or in Union hands.   Thinking the state safe from invasion, the Confederates built several small munitions factories in Georgia, as well as housing tens of thousands of Union prisoners. Their largest  prisoner of war camp , at  Andersonville , proved a death camp because of severe lack of supplies, food, water, and medicine.

A total of nearly 550 battles and skirmishes occurred within the state, with the vast majority in the last two years of the conflict. The first major battle in Georgia was a Confederate victory at the  Battle of Chickamauga  in  1863 it was the last major Confederate victory in the  west . In 1864,  William T. Sherman 's armies invaded Georgia as part of the  Atlanta Campaign . Confederate general  Joseph E. Johnston  fought a series of delaying battles, the largest being the  Battle of Kennesaw Mountain , as he tried to delay as long as possible by retreating toward Atlanta. Johnston's replacement, Gen.  John Bell Hood  attempted several unsuccessful counterattacks at the  Battle of Peachtree Creek  and the  Battle of Atlanta , but Sherman captured the city on  September 2 ,  1864 .   After burning Atlanta to the ground, Sherman embarked on his  March to the Sea  on  November 15 , en route to  Milledgeville , the state capital, which he reached on  November 23 , and the port city of  Savannah , which he entered on  December 22 . A swath of land about 60 miles across was destroyed in this campaign, less than 10% of the state. Once Sherman's army passed through, the Confederates regained control. The March is a major part of the state's folk history, and is the setting for  Margaret Mitchell 's 1936 novel  Gone with the Wind  and the subsequent  1939 film .   In December 1864, Sherman captured Savannah before leaving Georgia in January 1865 to begin his  Carolinas Campaign . However, there were still several small fights in Georgia after his departure. One of the last land battles of the Civil War, the  Battle of Columbus , was fought on the Georgia- Alabama  border.

Reconstruction  activities started immediately after the hostilities ceased, but lingering effects of the bitter strife stayed until well into the 20th century. Georgia did not re-enter the Union until  June 15 ,  1870 , more than two years after  South Carolina  was readmitted. Georgia was the last of the Confederate States to re-enter the Union.     [ edit ]   Civil War sites in Georgia   Today, many of Georgia's Civil War battlefields, particularly those around Atlanta, have been lost to modern urban development. However, a number of sites have been well preserved, including  Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park  and  Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park . Other Civil War related sites include  Stone Mountain ,  Fort Pulaski , and the  Atlanta Cyclorama , as well as  Confederate Memorial Park .   A number of  antebellum  mansions and plantations in Georgia are preserved and open to the public, particularly around Atlanta and Savannah.   Portions of the Civil War-era  Western & Atlantic Railroad  have historical markers commemorating events during the war, including several sites associated with the  Andrews Raid .

Despite significant  anti-war  activity in the state and  southern Indiana 's ancestral ties to the  Southern United States , it did not  secede  from the  Union . During the course of the war, Indiana contributed approximately 210,000 soldiers and millions of dollars of equipment and supplies to the Union. Residents of Indiana, also known as  Hoosiers , served in every major engagement of the war and almost every engagementminor or otherwisein the  western theater  of the war. Indiana, an agriculturally rich state containing the fifth-highest population in the Union and sixth-highest of all states, was critical to Northern success.   The state experienced political strife when  Governor   Oliver P. Morton  suppressed the  Democratic Party -controlled  General Assembly , which largely sympathized with the  Confederacy , leaving the state without the authority to collect taxes. The state neared  bankruptcy  during 1861, but the Governor chose to use private funds rather than rely on the legislature. The state experienced two minor raids by Confederate forces and one major raid in 1863, which caused a brief panic in southern portions of the state and in the capital city,  Indianapolis .   The American Civil War altered Indiana's society, politics, and economy, beginning a population shift  northward  and leading to a decline in the population of the southern part of the state. Wartime  tariffs  led to an increase in the population's standard of living and encouraged the growth of industry in the state.

News of the attack on  Fort Sumter , which began the war, reached Indiana on April 12, 1861. On the next day, two mass meetings were held in the state and the state's position was decided: Indiana would remain in the Union and would immediately contribute men to suppress the rebellion. On April 14th, Governor Morton issued a call to arms in order to raise men to meet the quota set by  President   Abraham Lincoln . [ 2 ]  Indiana had the fifth-largest population of any state that remained in the Union, and was important for its agricultural yield which became even more valuable to the Union after the loss of the rich farmland of the South. These factors made Indiana critical to the Union's success. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]   Lincoln initially requested that Indiana send 7,500 men to join the Union Army. Five hundred men assembled the first day, and within three weeks, more than 22,000 men had volunteeredso many that thousands had to be turned away. [ 5 ]  Before the war ended, Indiana contributed a total of 208,367 men, 15% of the state's total population, to fight and serve in the  Union Army , and 2,130 to serve in the  Union Navy . [ 6 ] [ 5 ] [ 7 ]  Most of the soldiers from Indiana were volunteers, and 11,718 men reenlisted at least once. [ 8 ]  The state only turned to  conscription  towards the end of the war, and a relatively small total of 3,003 men were drafted. [ 9 ]  These volunteers and conscripts allowed the state to supply the Union with 126 infantry regiments, 26 batteries of artillery, and 13 regiments of cavalry. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   More than 35% of the  Hoosiers  who entered the Union Army became casualties: 24,416 (about 6.75% of total war casualties) lost their lives in the conflict, and more than 50,000 were wounded. [ 6 ]   More than 60% of Indiana's regiments were mustered and trained in  Indianapolis , the state capital. The state government financed a large portion of the costs involved including barracking, feeding, and equipping the soldiers prior to their being sent as reinforcements to the standing Union armies. Indiana also maintained a state-owned arsenal in Indianapolis that served the Indiana home guard and as a backup supply depot for the Union Army. [ 12 ]   Abraham Lincoln  established one of the United States' first national cemeteries,  New Albany National Cemetery  in  New Albany ,  Indiana , for the war dead.  Port Fulton, Indiana , in present-day Jeffersonville, was home to the third-largest Union military hospital,  Jefferson General Hospital . Indianapolis was the site of  Camp Morton , one of the Union's largest prisons for captured Confederate soldiers, with  Lafayette ,  Richmond , and  Terre Haute  occasionally holding prisoners of war as well. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Conflicts          The Civil War in Indiana.       Indiana regiments were present on most battlefields of the Civil War and saw much fighting outside of the state. Only one significant conflict, which caused a brief panic in Indianapolis and southern Indiana, occurred on Indiana soil during the war.     [ edit ]   Raids   See also:  Newburgh Raid ,  Hines' Raid , and  Morgan's Raid   Confederate officer  Adam Johnson  briefly captured  Newburgh ,  Indiana , on July 18, 1862, during the  Newburgh Raid . Johnson convinced the Union troops  garrisoning  the town that he had  cannon  on the surrounding hills, when in fact they were merely camouflaged  stovepipes . The raid convinced the federal government that it was necessary to supply Indiana with a permanent force of  regular  Union Army soldiers to counter future raids. [ 14 ]   The one major incursion into Indiana by the  Confederate Army  was  Morgan's Raid . The raid occurred in July 1863 and was a Confederate  cavalry  offensive by troops under the command of  Brigadier General   John Hunt Morgan . In preparation for Morgan's planned raid,  Hines' Raid , a minor incursion, was carried out by troops under  Thomas Hines  in June 1863. [ 15 ]   On July 8, 1863, Morgan crossed the  Ohio River  at  Mauckport ,  Indiana , with 2,400 troopers. His landing was initially contested by a small party of the  Indiana Legion , who withdrew when Morgan began firing artillery from the southern shore of the river. The militia quickly retreated towards  Corydon , where a larger body of militia was gathering to block Morgan's advance. Morgan advanced rapidly on Corydon and fought the  Battle of Corydon . After a short, fierce fight, Morgan took command of high ground south of the town. Corydon promptly surrendered after Morgan's artillery fired two warning shots into the town from the high ground. The town was  sacked , but little damage was done to buildings in the town. Morgan continued his raid by moving northward and burning most of the town of  Salem . [ 16 ]   His movements appeared to be a charge at  Indianapolis , and panic spread through the capital. Governor Morton had called up the state militia as soon as Morgan's intention to cross into the state was known. More than 60,000 men of all ages came out to repel Morgan's raid. [ 17 ]  Morgan considered attacking  Camp Morton  in Indianapolis to free more than 5,000 Confederate  prisoners of war  imprisoned there, but decided against it. After destroying Salem, Morgan turned abruptly eastward and began moving towards  Ohio . He continued to raid and pillage his way toward the Indiana-Ohio border until he left Indiana on July 13 as several Union armies began to converge on him. By the time he left Indiana, his raid on the North was turning into a desperate attempt to escape back to the South. [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Indiana regiments   See also:  List of Indiana Civil War regiments           3rd Regiment Indiana Cavalry  at camp       Many of Indiana's 165 regiments served with distinction in the war. [ 11 ]  The regiments each consisted of approximately 1,500 men when formed, but as their numbers declined due to casualties, smaller regiments were merged together. The first six regiments mustered at the start of the war were enlisted for six months and were put into action in the western theater. [ 11 ]  Their short terms of service and few numbers were inadequate for the task of fighting the war, and by the end of 1861, Indiana fielded an additional sixty-five regiments whose men enlisted for terms of three years. [ 11 ]  These three-year regiments were employed in large part in the western theater. As the war progressed, another forty-eight regiments were mustered in 1862, with about half being sent to the eastern theater, and the other half remaining in the west. [ 11 ]  During 1863, eighteen regiments were raised to replace the casualties of the first two years' fighting. [ 11 ]  During Morgan's Raid of that year, ten temporary regiments were created and enlisted for terms of three months apiece, but disbanded once the threat posed by Morgan was gone. [ 11 ]  The last twenty-five regiments created in the state were mustered in 1864, and served until the end of the war. Most of Indiana's regiments were mustered out and disbanded by the end of 1864 as fighting declined, but some continued in service. The 13th Regiment Indiana Cavalry was the last regiment from the state to be mustered out of the U.S. Army, leaving service on November 10, 1865. [ 11 ]           9th Indiana Infantry Regiment  Company A       The  19th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment  served as part of the  Iron Brigade . The 19th made critical contributions to some of the most important engagements of the war, including the  Second Battle of Bull Run , but was almost completely destroyed in the  Battle of Gettysburg . [ 19 ]   The  14th Indiana Infantry Regiment , also called the Gallant Fourteenth, was another notable Indiana regiment. In the Battle of Gettysburg, it was the regiment that secured  Cemetery Hill  on the first day of the three-day fight and prevented the possible destruction of the Union Army. [ 20 ]  Another famous regiment was the  9th Indiana Infantry Regiment , which fought in many major battles and was among the first Hoosier regiments to see action in the war.   The  28th Indiana Colored Infantry Regiment  was formed on March 31, 1864, at Camp Fremont in Indianapolis near what is now the Fountain Square district. It was the only black regiment formed in Indiana during the war and lost 212 men during the conflict. [ 21 ]  The regiment signed on for 36 months, but the war was effectively over in fewer than eleven months from their enlistment, cutting the regiment's length of service short. [ 21 ]   The last casualty of the Civil War was a Hoosier of the  34th Regiment Indiana Infantry . Private  John J. Williams  died at the  Battle of Palmito Ranch  on May 13, 1865. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Politics   Due to their location across the  Ohio River  from  Louisville ,  Kentucky , the Indiana cities of  Jeffersonville ,  New Albany , and  Port Fulton  saw increased trade and military activity. Some of this increase was due to  Kentucky 's desire to stay neutral in the war. In addition, Kentucky was home to many Confederate sympathizers, and bases were needed for Union operations against Confederates in Kentucky. Militarily, it was safer to store war supplies in towns on the north side of the Ohio River.  Camp Joe Holt  was established between Jeffersonville and New Albany in what is the present-day visitor's center of the  Falls of the Ohio State Park  in  Clarksville ,  Indiana . Towards the end of the war, Port Fulton was home to the third-largest hospital in the United States,  Jefferson General Hospital , which was built on land confiscated from expelled  U.S. Senator  and Confederate sympathizer  Jesse D. Bright . [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   Southern influence          Governor, Congressman and Senator  Oliver H.P. Morton       In 1861, when Kentucky governor  Beriah Magoffin  refused an order to allow pro-Union forces to mobilize in his statehe issued a similar order regarding Confederate forcesIndiana governor Morton issued orders allowing loyal Kentuckians to join Indiana regiments. Many Kentucky troops, especially from the city of Louisville, joined Hoosier regiments at  Camp Joe Holt . Morton repeatedly came to the military rescue of  Kentucky 's pro-Union government during the war and became known as the ""Governor of Indiana and Kentucky."" Morton also was called the ""Soldiers Friend"" because he organized the General Military Agency of Indiana, the Soldiers' Home, Ladies' Home, and Orphans' Home to help meet the needs of Indiana's soldiers and their families. Morton also established an arsenal in Indianapolis to supply the Indiana Militia, Home Guard, and the federal government. [ 25 ]   The Civil War era showed the extent of Southern influence on Indiana. Much of southern and central Indiana had strong ties to the South. Many of the region's early settlers had come from the Confederate state of  Virginia  and from Kentucky. Indiana and Kentucky always had a special friendship, and the Hoosiers were influenced by the actions of the Kentucky government, which attempted to stay neutral in the beginning stages of the war. [ 2 ]  Governor Morton wrote to President  Abraham Lincoln  that no other free state was so populated with southerners, and they kept Morton from being as forceful against secession as he wanted to be. [ 26 ]   Indiana Senator  Jesse D. Bright  had been a leader among the Indiana Democratic Party for several years prior to the outbreak of the war. In 1862, Bright was expelled from the  United States Senate  on allegations of disloyalty. He had written a letter to ""His Excellency,  Jefferson Davis , President of the Confederation"", in which Bright offered the services of a friend to sell the South superior  firearms . He was the last senator to be expelled from the Senate. [ 27 ]  Bright was replaced with a pro-Union Democrat, former governor  Joseph A. Wright . [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Conflict with the Democrats   On April 21, 1861, Morton called a  special session  of the Indiana General Assembly to allow him to raise additional regiments for service in the Union Army. Initially the legislature, which was controlled by the Democratic Party, was supportive of his measures and passed the legislation Morton requested. [ 3 ]  After the legislature adjourned in May, the  Indiana Daily Sentinel  newspaper and some prominent Democrats in the state changed their opinion of the war. The  Sentinel  ran anti-war articles, including one entitled ""Let Them Go In Peace"". The Democratic position was clarified at a state convention in the summer of 1862. The convention was chaired by  Thomas Hendricks , and convention members stated that they supported the integrity of the Union and the war effort but opposed the abolition of slavery. [ 28 ]   During 1862, Morton never called the Indiana General Assembly into session. Morton feared the legislature's Democratic majority would attempt to hinder the war effort and could vote to secede from the Union. He issued secret instructions to Republican legislators, asking them to stay away from the capitol to prevent the General Assembly from attaining the  quorum  needed for the body to meet on its own. [ 29 ]  Because Morton did not allow the General Assembly to meet, no budget or tax provisions were passed. This rapidly led to a crisis as Indiana ran out of money to conduct business, and the state was on the edge of bankruptcy. Going beyond his  constitutional powers , Morton solicited millions of dollars in private loans. His move to subvert the legislature was successful, and Morton was able privately to fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. [ 30 ]  In one notable incident, Morton had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention in an incident that would latter be referred to as the  Battle of Pogue's Run . [ 31 ] . Morton urged pro-war Democrats to abandon their party in the name of unity for the duration of the war. [ 3 ]          Indiana Senator  Jesse Bright  was expelled from the  Senate  on suspicions of disloyalty.       Indiana's political problems worsened after the  Emancipation Proclamation  in 1863. Many of the formerly pro-war Democrats moved to openly oppose the war. The same year, Morton began a crackdown on dissidents. [ 32 ]  While most of the state was decidedly pro-Union, a group of Southern sympathizers known as the  Sons of the Golden Circle  had a strong presence in northern Indiana. This group proved enough of a distraction that General  Lew Wallace , commander of Union forces in the region, [ 33 ]  had to spend considerable time fighting their activities. By June 1863, the group was successfully broken up by Wallace and Morton. Many Golden Circle members were arrested without formal charges, the pro-Confederate press was prevented from printing anti-war material, and the writ of  habeas corpus  was denied to anyone suspected of disloyalty. When Confederate special agent Thomas Hines went to  Paoli  in June 1863, seeking support for Confederate General John Hunt Morgan's  eventual raid into Indiana , he was met with indifference and given nothing from the Circle. [ 34 ]   In reaction to his actions cracking down on dissent, the Indiana Democratic Party called Morton a ""Dictator"" and an ""Underhanded Mobster"" while Republicans countered that the Democrats were using ""treasonable and obstructionist tactics in the conduct of the war"". [ 5 ]  Large-scale support for the Confederacy among Golden Circle members and Southern Hoosiers in general fell away after Morgan's Raid, when Confederate raiders ransacked many homes bearing the banners of the Golden Circle despite their proclaimed support for the Confederates. After that, said Confederate Colonel  Basil W. Duke , ""The Copperheads and Vallandighammers fought harder than the others"" against Morgan's Raiders. [ 35 ]  When Hoosiers failed to rise in large numbers in support of Morgan's Raid, Morton slowed his crackdown on Confederate sympathizers, theorizing that because they had failed to come to Morgan's aid in large numbers, they would similarly fail to come to the aid of a larger invasion. [ 36 ]   Smuggling into Confederate territory was common in the early days of the war, when the Union Army had not yet pushed the front lines far to the south of the Ohio River. The towns of New Albany and Jeffersonville were pressured by the  Cincinnati Daily Gazette  to stop trading with the South, especially with Louisville, as Kentuckys proclaimed neutrality was perceived as Southern-leaning. A fraudulent  steamboat  company was set up to go between  Madison  and Louisville, with its boat, the  Masonic Gem , making regular trips to Confederate ports for trade. Throughout the war, New Albany and Jeffersonville were the origin of many Northern goods smuggled into the Confederacy. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Southern sympathizers   Technically, not all of Indiana remained in the Union during the war.  Boggstown  and the rest of Sugar Creek Township in  Shelby County , twenty miles southeast of Indianapolis, voted to secede from the Union on February 16, 1861. However, the only value the South received from this secession was a brief piece of propaganda. A movement to rescind the secession resolution arose in 1961, but the measure repealing the secession never passed. [ 38 ]   While not particularly numerous, some  Hoosiers  chose to fight for the South. Most traveled to Kentucky to join Confederate regiments formed in that state. Sgt. Henry L. Stone of  Greencastle  rode with John Hunt Morgan when he raided Indiana. The exact number of Hoosiers to serve in Confederate armies is unknown, but there are numerous references to such men. The records of the  Indianapolis National Guard  indicate three men decided to join the Confederacy. Hoosier brothers-in-law Thomas Smith and Garrett Vandiver fought in  Mississippi  and  Arkansas . [ 39 ]   Francis A. Shoup  briefly led the Indianapolis  Zouave  militia, but left for  Florida  prior to the start of the war and ultimately become a Confederate Brigadier General. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Republican takeover   For the loans needed to run the state during the long period of no legislative support, Morton turned to  James Lanier , a wealthy banker from  Madison , Indiana. On two occasions, Lanier loaned the state more than $1 million ( USD ) without security. When the Republican Party gained a legislative majority in 1864, he was paid back and the grateful state preserved his  Madison residence  as a historic site. [ 5 ]  Without Lanier's support the government would certainly have bankrupted and hurt the Union war effort. There was little the legislature could do but watch as the Governor ran the state with private financing, as Morton had the Republican legislators leave Indianapolis for Madison, to prevent a  quorum . [ 40 ]   The 1864 Republican legislative majority came at a critical turning point in the war, as the North was slowly tightening the  blockade  of the South. The new legislature fully supported Morton's policies and worked to meet the state's commitments to the war effort. It validated the loans Morton had taken to run the state, assumed them as state debt, and commended Morton for his actions in the interim. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Aftermath   News of Confederate General  Robert E. Lee 's  surrender  reached Indianapolis at 11 p.m. on April 9, 1865. [ 41 ]   The Indianapolis Journal  called the subsequent celebrations within the city ""demented"". [ 41 ]  The celebrations ceased after news of the  assassination of Lincoln  arrived on April 15th. Lincoln's funeral train passed through the capital city on April 30, and 100,000 people attended his  bier  at the  Indiana State House . [ 41 ]     [ edit ]   Economic   The Civil War forever altered Indianas economy. Before the war, New Albany was the largest city in the state, primarily due to its commerce with the South. More than 50% of the wealthiest Hoosiers had lived in New Albany at the start of the war. [ 42 ]  Trade with the South dwindled during the war, and after the war much of Indiana saw New Albany as too friendly to the South. [ 43 ]  New Albanys formerly robust industry building steamboats for Southern trade ended in 1870. The last steamboat built in New Albany was named the  Robert E. Lee . The city never regained its pre-war stature, the population leveling at 40,000 people, and only its antebellum, early-Victorian  Mansion-Row  remains from its boom period. [ 43 ]   The war caused Indiana's industry to grow exponentially. The shift in population to the central and northern portions of the state was accelerated as new industry and cities began to develop around the  Great Lakes  and the railroad depots created during the war. [ 3 ]  In the north,  Colonel Eli Lilly , an officer from the war, founded  Eli Lilly and Company  which grew into the state's largest corporation. Charles Conn, another war veteran, founded  C.G. Conn Ltd  in  Elkhart  which gave rise to a new industry there, building musical instruments. Indianapolis was also the wartime home of Doctor  Richard Gatling , who invented the  Gatling Gun , one of the world's first machine guns, in the city. [ 44 ]  However, it was not officially approved by the United States government until after the war, in August 1866. [ 45 ]  In contrast to the growing industrial power of central and northern Indiana, Southern Indiana remained largely agricultural for another 40 years. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Political   When the war ended, the state's Democrats were upset over their treatment during the war. The Democratic Party in Indiana staged a quick comeback, and Indiana became the first state after the Civil War to elect a Democratic governor.  Thomas Hendricks ' rise to office initiated a period of Democratic control that reversed many of the political gains made by the Republican Party during the war. [ 47 ]   Indiana's Senators were strong supporters of the radical  Reconstruction  plans proposed by Congress. Both Oliver Morton (who was elected to the Senate after his term as governor) and Senator  Schuyler Colfax  voted in favor of the impeachment of President  Andrew Johnson . Morton was especially disappointed in Congress' failure to remove him. [ 48 ]   When the South came back under firm Democratic control at the end of the 1870s, Indiana, which was closely split between the parties, became a key  swing state  that often decided the balance of power in Congress and the Presidency. Almost every presidential election between the Civil War and  World War I  included one or more Hoosiers as national political parties tried to win the support of Indiana's electorate. [ 47 ]  In 1888, while at the height of the state's post-war political influence,  Benjamin Harrison  was elected President, the first native Hoosier to assume the office.     [ edit ]   Social          The  Circle  in Indianapolis was built to honor the war dead.       More than half the state's households contributed one or more members to fight in the war. [ 30 ]  This made the effects of the conflict widely felt throughout the state. After the war, veterans programs were initiated to help wounded soldiers with housing, food, and other basic needs. Orphanages and asylums were established to help the wives and children of the war dead. [ 49 ]   The tariffs on imported goods put in place during the war increased the profits on most of Indiana's domestically produced goods. This led to a higher standard of living for many Hoosiers in rural Indiana. [ 50 ]   The 1870s saw the beginning of the  Women's Suffrage Movement  in Indiana. Suffrage legislation was introduced in the Indiana General Assembly during the term of Governor Thomas Hendricks, but the bill was defeated. The decade also saw the start of the  Prohibition Movement  and the founding of many temperance organizations. In the immediate aftermath of the war, many localities banned the sale or production of liquors. [ 51 ]   The  Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument  in downtown Indianapolis was built to honor the Indiana veterans of the Civil War. The construction began in 1888 after two decades of discussion and was finally completed in 1901.

During the war, Georgia sent nearly 100,000 soldiers to battle, mostly to the armies in  Virginia . The state switched from  cotton  to food production, but severe transportation difficulties eventually restricted supplies. Early in the war, the state's 1,400 miles of railroad tracks provided a frequently used means of moving supplies and men, but by the middle of 1864, much of these lay in ruins or in Union hands.   Thinking the state safe from invasion, the Confederates built several small munitions factories in Georgia, as well as housing tens of thousands of Union prisoners. Their largest  prisoner of war camp , at  Andersonville , proved a death camp because of severe lack of supplies, food, water, and medicine.

A total of nearly 550 battles and skirmishes occurred within the state, with the vast majority in the last two years of the conflict. The first major battle in Georgia was a Confederate victory at the  Battle of Chickamauga  in  1863 it was the last major Confederate victory in the  west . In 1864,  William T. Sherman 's armies invaded Georgia as part of the  Atlanta Campaign . Confederate general  Joseph E. Johnston  fought a series of delaying battles, the largest being the  Battle of Kennesaw Mountain , as he tried to delay as long as possible by retreating toward Atlanta. Johnston's replacement, Gen.  John Bell Hood  attempted several unsuccessful counterattacks at the  Battle of Peachtree Creek  and the  Battle of Atlanta , but Sherman captured the city on  September 2 ,  1864 .   After burning Atlanta to the ground, Sherman embarked on his  March to the Sea  on  November 15 , en route to  Milledgeville , the state capital, which he reached on  November 23 , and the port city of  Savannah , which he entered on  December 22 . A swath of land about 60 miles across was destroyed in this campaign, less than 10% of the state. Once Sherman's army passed through, the Confederates regained control. The March is a major part of the state's folk history, and is the setting for  Margaret Mitchell 's 1936 novel  Gone with the Wind  and the subsequent  1939 film .   In December 1864, Sherman captured Savannah before leaving Georgia in January 1865 to begin his  Carolinas Campaign . However, there were still several small fights in Georgia after his departure. One of the last land battles of the Civil War, the  Battle of Columbus , was fought on the Georgia- Alabama  border.

Reconstruction  activities started immediately after the hostilities ceased, but lingering effects of the bitter strife stayed until well into the 20th century. Georgia did not re-enter the Union until  June 15 ,  1870 , more than two years after  South Carolina  was readmitted. Georgia was the last of the Confederate States to re-enter the Union.     [ edit ]   Civil War sites in Georgia   Today, many of Georgia's Civil War battlefields, particularly those around Atlanta, have been lost to modern urban development. However, a number of sites have been well preserved, including  Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park  and  Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park . Other Civil War related sites include  Stone Mountain ,  Fort Pulaski , and the  Atlanta Cyclorama , as well as  Confederate Memorial Park .   A number of  antebellum  mansions and plantations in Georgia are preserved and open to the public, particularly around Atlanta and Savannah.

During the war, Georgia sent nearly 100,000 soldiers to battle, mostly to the armies in  Virginia . The state switched from  cotton  to food production, but severe transportation difficulties eventually restricted supplies. Early in the war, the state's 1,400 miles of railroad tracks provided a frequently used means of moving supplies and men, but by the middle of 1864, much of these lay in ruins or in Union hands.   Thinking the state safe from invasion, the Confederates built several small munitions factories in Georgia, as well as housing tens of thousands of Union prisoners. Their largest  prisoner of war camp , at  Andersonville , proved a death camp because of severe lack of supplies, food, water, and medicine.

A total of nearly 550 battles and skirmishes occurred within the state, with the vast majority in the last two years of the conflict. The first major battle in Georgia was a Confederate victory at the  Battle of Chickamauga  in  1863 it was the last major Confederate victory in the  west . In 1864,  William T. Sherman 's armies invaded Georgia as part of the  Atlanta Campaign . Confederate general  Joseph E. Johnston  fought a series of delaying battles, the largest being the  Battle of Kennesaw Mountain , as he tried to delay as long as possible by retreating toward Atlanta. Johnston's replacement, Gen.  John Bell Hood  attempted several unsuccessful counterattacks at the  Battle of Peachtree Creek  and the  Battle of Atlanta , but Sherman captured the city on  September 2 ,  1864 .   After burning Atlanta to the ground, Sherman embarked on his  March to the Sea  on  November 15 , en route to  Milledgeville , the state capital, which he reached on  November 23 , and the port city of  Savannah , which he entered on  December 22 . A swath of land about 60 miles across was destroyed in this campaign, less than 10% of the state. Once Sherman's army passed through, the Confederates regained control. The March is a major part of the state's folk history, and is the setting for  Margaret Mitchell 's 1936 novel  Gone with the Wind  and the subsequent  1939 film .   In December 1864, Sherman captured Savannah before leaving Georgia in January 1865 to begin his  Carolinas Campaign . However, there were still several small fights in Georgia after his departure. One of the last land battles of the Civil War, the  Battle of Columbus , was fought on the Georgia- Alabama  border.

Reconstruction  activities started immediately after the hostilities ceased, but lingering effects of the bitter strife stayed until well into the 20th century. Georgia did not re-enter the Union until  June 15 ,  1870 , more than two years after  South Carolina  was readmitted. Georgia was the last of the Confederate States to re-enter the Union.     [ edit ]   Civil War sites in Georgia   Today, many of Georgia's Civil War battlefields, particularly those around Atlanta, have been lost to modern urban development. However, a number of sites have been well preserved, including  Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park  and  Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park . Other Civil War related sites include  Stone Mountain ,  Fort Pulaski , and the  Atlanta Cyclorama , as well as  Confederate Memorial Park .   A number of  antebellum  mansions and plantations in Georgia are preserved and open to the public, particularly around Atlanta and Savannah.   Portions of the Civil War-era  Western & Atlantic Railroad  have historical markers commemorating events during the war, including several sites associated with the  Andrews Raid .

During the war, Georgia sent nearly 100,000 soldiers to battle, mostly to the armies in  Virginia . The state switched from  cotton  to food production, but severe transportation difficulties eventually restricted supplies. Early in the war, the state's 1,400 miles of railroad tracks provided a frequently used means of moving supplies and men, but by the middle of 1864, much of these lay in ruins or in Union hands.   Thinking the state safe from invasion, the Confederates built several small munitions factories in Georgia, as well as housing tens of thousands of Union prisoners. Their largest  prisoner of war camp , at  Andersonville , proved a death camp because of severe lack of supplies, food, water, and medicine.

A total of nearly 550 battles and skirmishes occurred within the state, with the vast majority in the last two years of the conflict. The first major battle in Georgia was a Confederate victory at the  Battle of Chickamauga  in  1863 it was the last major Confederate victory in the  west . In 1864,  William T. Sherman 's armies invaded Georgia as part of the  Atlanta Campaign . Confederate general  Joseph E. Johnston  fought a series of delaying battles, the largest being the  Battle of Kennesaw Mountain , as he tried to delay as long as possible by retreating toward Atlanta. Johnston's replacement, Gen.  John Bell Hood  attempted several unsuccessful counterattacks at the  Battle of Peachtree Creek  and the  Battle of Atlanta , but Sherman captured the city on  September 2 ,  1864 .   After burning Atlanta to the ground, Sherman embarked on his  March to the Sea  on  November 15 , en route to  Milledgeville , the state capital, which he reached on  November 23 , and the port city of  Savannah , which he entered on  December 22 . A swath of land about 60 miles across was destroyed in this campaign, less than 10% of the state. Once Sherman's army passed through, the Confederates regained control. The March is a major part of the state's folk history, and is the setting for  Margaret Mitchell 's 1936 novel  Gone with the Wind  and the subsequent  1939 film .   In December 1864, Sherman captured Savannah before leaving Georgia in January 1865 to begin his  Carolinas Campaign . However, there were still several small fights in Georgia after his departure. One of the last land battles of the Civil War, the  Battle of Columbus , was fought on the Georgia- Alabama  border.

Although relatively small in population, the city became a critical point of contention during the  Atlanta Campaign  in 1864 when a powerful  Union army  approached from Federally-held  Tennessee . The fall of Atlanta was a critical point in the Civil War, giving the  North  more confidence, and (along with the victories at  Mobile Bay  and  Winchester ) leading to the re-election of  President   Abraham Lincoln  and the eventual surrender of the Confederacy.

However, it was the 12th largest city in what became the  Confederate States of America .   The city was a vital transportation and logistics center, with several major railroads in the area, including the  Western & Atlantic Railroad , which connected the city with  Chattanooga, Tennessee , 138 miles to the north. A series of roads radiated out from the city in all directions, connecting Atlanta with neighboring towns and states. Thought to be relatively safe from Union forces early in the war, Atlanta rapidly became a concentration point for the Confederate quartermasters and logistics experts, and warehouses were filled with food, forage, supplies, ammunition, clothing and other war  materiel  critical to the Confederate armies operating in the  Western Theater .   The  Atlanta Rolling Mill , established before the war, was significantly expanded and provided a major source for armor plating for  Confederate Navy   ironclads , including the  CSS Virginia . It also refurbished railroad tracks. A large number of machine shops, foundries, and other industrial concerns were soon established in Atlanta, and the population swelled to nearly 22,000 as workers arrived for these new factories and warehouses.   A number of newspapers flourished in Atlanta during the Civil War. Among the more prominent ones were the  Atlanta Southern Confederacy  and the  Daily Intelligencer , which was moved to  Macon  during the Union occupation in 1864. It was the only Atlanta paper to survive the war and resume publication after the hostilities.     [ edit ]   Atlanta as a target           Palisades  and  chevaux de frise  in front of the Potter House, Atlanta, Georgia, 1864       Concerned after the  Vicksburg Campaign  that Atlanta would be a logical target for future Union Army attacks, the  Confederate  Chief of the Engineer Bureau,  Jeremy F. Gilmer , contacted Atlanta businessman and entrepreneur  Lemuel P. Grant  and asked him to survey possible enemy crossings of the  Chattahoochee River , a broad waterway that offered some protection from an approach from the north. Grant soon complied. After a thorough investigation and survey, Grant explained to Gilmer that fortifying Atlanta would be as difficult as that of  Richmond, Virginia , due to the many possible approaches an enemy army could take. However, Gilmer gave him the approval to develop a plan to ring the city with forts and earthworks along all the key approaches to Atlanta.   Grant planned a series of 17  redoubts  forming a 10-mile (16 km) circle over a mile (1.6 km) out from the center of town. These would be interlinked with a series of earthworks and trenches, along with rows of  abatis  and other imprediments to enemy troops. Construction on the extensive defensive works began in August 1863. They were bounded on the north on high ground (the present location of the  Fox Theatre ), the west by Ashby Street, the south by McDonough Drive, and the east by what is today known as  Grant Park . Gilmer inspected the completed work in December 1863 and gave his approval. Because of how the subsequent Atlanta Campaign unfolded, much of these fortifications were never really put to the test.     [ edit ]   The fall of Atlanta   In 1864, the city, as feared by Gilmer, did indeed become the target of a major Union invasion (the subject of the 1939 film  Gone with the Wind ). The area now covered by metropolitan Atlanta was the scene of several fiercely contested battles, including the  Battle of Peachtree Creek , the  Battle of Atlanta , and the  Battle of Ezra Church . On  September 1 ,  1864 ,  Confederate  General  John Bell Hood  evacuated Atlanta, after a four-month  siege  mounted by Union General  William Sherman  and ordered all public buildings and possible Union assets destroyed.   On  September 2 , a committee of Mayor  James Calhoun  and Union-leaning citizens  William Markham ,  Jonathan Norcross , and  Edward Rawson  met a captain on the staff of Maj. Gen.  Henry W. Slocum  and surrendered the city. [ 1 ]  Sherman sent a telegram to Washington reading, ""Atlanta is ours, and fairly won"" and he established his headquarters there on  September 7 , where he stayed for two months. That same day, Sherman ordered the civilian population to evacuate. [ 2 ]  His forces occupied the city for several months, and he then ordered Atlanta burned to the ground on  November 11  in preparation for his punitive march south. After a plea by Father Thomas O'Reilly of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church, Sherman did not burn the city's churches or hospitals. However, the remaining war resources were then destroyed in the aftermath and in  Sherman's March to the Sea . As General Sherman departed Atlanta at 7:00 a.m. on  November 15  with the bulk of his army, he noted his handiwork:     ... We rode out of Atlanta by the  Decatur road , filled by the marching troops and wagons of the  Fourteenth Corps ; and reaching the hill, just outside of the old rebel works, we naturally paused to look back upon the scenes of our past battles. We stood upon the very ground whereon was fought the bloody battle of July 22d, and could see the copse of wood where  McPherson  fell. Behind us lay Atlanta, smouldering and in ruins, the black smoke rising high in air, and hanging like a pall over the ruined city.     William T. Sherman,  Memoirs of General W.T. Sherman, Chapter 21       [ edit ]   Aftermath   The fall of Atlanta was especially noteworthy for its political ramifications. Former Union General  George B. McClellan  was running against President Lincoln on a peace platform in the  1864 election . Part of the  Democratic  platform called for a truce with the Confederates. Had this truce been achieved, it is highly unlikely that the war could ever have been restarted. However, the capture of Atlanta and Hood's burning of many military facilities as he evacuated were extensively covered by Northern newspapers, and significantly boosted Northern morale. Lincoln was re-elected by a comfortable margin.   Federal soldiers continued to occupy Atlanta for the rest of the war. With the Confederacy's dwindling resources and military strength, the Confederate army was never in a position to retake the city. Periodic cavalry raids continued on Union supply lines in the general vicinity for some time.   Following the war, the Federal troops remained in Atlanta to help enforce the provisions of  Reconstruction .

Some references to the ""University of North Carolina,"" such as in NCAA college athletics, may be specifically referring to the system's founding campus.  For that campus, see  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .       University of North Carolina                     Established :   1789 ( Chapel Hill )  1972 (statewide system)       Type:   Public       President :   Erskine Boyce Bowles       Students :   183,000       Location:   North Carolina ,  United States       Campus:   Multi-Campus University       Former names:   Consolidated University of North Carolina       Website :   www.northcarolina.edu             The  University of North Carolina  system includes all sixteen public four-year universities in  North Carolina ,  United States  and one  public residential high school . While the system's Board of Governors oversees general system policy, the campuses are classified as separate institutions and are largely autonomous from the system office. The UNC system has a total enrollment of over 183,000 students and confers over 75% of all bachelor degrees in North Carolina.

In 1877, the State of North Carolina began sponsoring additional higher education institutions. Over time the state added a  women's college , a  land-grant university , five  historically black institutions , and one to educate  Native Americans . Others were created to prepare  teachers for public education  and to instruct  performing artists .   During the  Depression , the  North Carolina General Assembly  searched for cost savings within state government. Towards this effort in 1931, it redefined the University of North Carolina, which at the time referred exclusively to the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , using it for the name of the entire University of North Carolina system. The new  Consolidated University of North Carolina  was created to include the existing campuses of  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina State University , and the  University of North Carolina at Greensboro . The three campuses came under the leadership of just one board and one president. By 1969, three additional campuses had joined the Consolidated University through legislative action: the  University of North Carolina at Charlotte , the  University of North Carolina at Asheville , and the  University of North Carolina at Wilmington .   In 1971, North Carolina passed legislation bringing into the University of North Carolina system all 16 public institutions that confer bachelor degrees. This round of consolidation granted each constituent institution a  Chancellor  and a  Board of Trustees . In 1985, the  North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics , a residential high school for gifted students, was declared an affiliated school of the university. In 2007, the high school became a full member of the system.     [ edit ]   Structure          PULSTAR Reactor. North Carolina State is one of several research universities in the system.       Article IX of the  North Carolina State Constitution  provides authorization for the creation of the University of North Carolina. [ 2 ]  Under this authorization, Chapter 116 of the  North Carolina General Statutes  entrusts the University of North Carolina to its Board of Governors. [ 3 ]  The Board of Governors is the policy-making body charged with ""the general determination, control, supervision, management, and governance of all affairs of the constituent institutions."" It elects the president, who administers the university. The 32 voting members of the Board of Governors are elected by the General Assembly for four-year terms. The current Chairwoman of the system's Board of Governors is Hannah Gage, who was preceded by Jim W. Phillips, Jr. The president of the Association of Student Governments is also a non-voting member.   The Board of Governors delegates extensive administrative authority to each constituent university. Each institution is headed by a chancellor, who is chosen by the Board of Governors on the president's nomination and is responsible to the president. Each institution also has a board of trustees, consisting of eight members elected by the Board of Governors, four appointed by the  governor , and the president of the student body. The composition of the Board of Trustees is set by statute.     [ edit ]   Legal mandate   The legal authority and mandate for the University of North Carolina can be found in the  North Carolina Constitution . Article 9 of the constitution deals with all forms of public education in the state. Sections 8 and 9 of that article stipulate the function and cost to students of the University of North Carolina. [ 3 ]          UNC Charlotte. The system expanded significantly in the 1960s and 1970s.         Sec. 8. Higher education.       The General Assembly shall maintain a public system of higher education, comprising The University of North Carolina and such other institutions of higher education as the General Assembly may deem wise. The General Assembly shall provide for the selection of trustees of The University of North Carolina and of the other institutions of higher education, in whom shall be vested all the privileges, rights, franchises, and endowments heretofore granted to or conferred upon the trustees of these institutions. The General Assembly may enact laws necessary and expedient for the maintenance and management of The University of North Carolina and the other public institutions of higher education.       Sec. 9. Benefits of public institutions of higher education.       The General Assembly shall provide that the benefits of The University of North Carolina and other public institutions of higher education, as far as practicable, be extended to the people of the State free of expense.   [ 4 ]       [ edit ]   Institutions   Within its seventeen campuses, the system houses two medical schools and one teaching hospital, ten nursing programs, a school of dentistry, and a school of pharmacy, as well as a  veterinary school , two law schools, 15 schools of education, three schools of engineering, and a school for performing artists. [ 1 ]  The oldest university, the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , first admitted students in 1795. The smallest and newest member is the  North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics , a residential two-year high school, founded in 1980 and a full member of the system from 2007. The largest university is  North Carolina State University , with 31,130 students.   While the official names of each campus are determined by the North Carolina General Assembly, abbreviations are determined by the individual school.

The  Census Bureau  estimated its population at 81,913 in 2006, [ 3 ]  making it the sixth-largest city in the  Kansas City Metropolitan Area  and the sixth-largest city in Missouri. In 2006 CNN/Money and  Money  magazine ranked Lee's Summit 44th on its list of the 100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.

From the  1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri .       Founded as the ""Town of Strother"", by William B. Howard for his wife, Maria D. Strother (daughter of William D. Strother formally of  Bardstown, Kentucky ). Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from  Kentucky , married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had 833 acres (3.37 km 2 ) and a homestead five miles (8 km) north of town. He was arrested for being a  Confederate  in October of 1862, near the beginning of the  Civil War , and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the  Missouri Pacific Railroad  was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with 70 acres (280,000 m 2 ) in the fall of 1865. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   In 1865 the town changed it's name for early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who moved to Jackson County in 1849, from  Bradley County, Tennessee . Lea was listed as the postmaster of Big Cedar in the 1855  United States Official Postal Guide . [ 7 ]  Dr. Lea was killed in August of 1862 by  Kansas Jayhawkers  (or Redlegs). [ 8 ]   When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of ""Lea's Summit"", the ""summit"" portion to reflect its relatively highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. [ 5 ]  But they misspelled the name ""Lees Summit"" (with two ""e's""; ""Lee"" instead of ""Lea""; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, [ 9 ]  then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. [ 10 ]  Also the named was misspelled on the stone culvert near the station, on the side of the Missouri Pacific depot, but on the other side it was spelled correctly, accordingly the railroad used this spelling, as did travelers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Others, those with Southern sympathies, claim that the town was named after famed Civil War General  Robert E. Lee  after Southerners began moving north into Missouri after the war. [ 5 ]  Attributed to a misquote in the  Louisville Journal , January 3, 1866. [ 10 ]   Since the name was already being circulated and published with two ""e's"", the town petitioned the state capitol and incorporated its name in 1868 as: ""Town of Lee's Summit"". [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Lee's Summit in the early 20th century       In 1912, R.A. Long, the owner of a  lumber  company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of  Kansas City . When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the 1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ). The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary, and the site of Longview Community College. The church and mansion are on the  National Register of Historic Places . Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. [ 5 ]   In March 2006, a new City Hall was dedicated replacing one that was considered insufficient for the size of the city. The downtown city hall construction had closed portions of 2nd street, Main Street, and Green Street. Currently, the city is working on a streetscaping project for downtown called ""Diggin It"".

clueweb09-en0008-66-31309	               Nearly as long as there has been a Denver, Colorado, there has been a Rocky Mountain News. Help us save the Rocky.                         Home    OUR NEWSPAPER    COMMENT    E-MAIL     RSS     ABOUT                                        Home  » Contact Rep.-elect Jared Polis       Contact Rep.-elect Jared Polis            District 2, Boulder, Broomfield, Summit, Eagle, Gilpin, Grand and Clear Creek counties, and Federal Heights, Northglenn, Firestone, Frederick, Westminster and Thornton   E-mail:   info@polisforcongress.com   E-mail or call our Colorado lawmakers in Washington. Write your own e-mail or copy and paste the letter below and add your name at the bottom:   Dear Rep.-elect Polis:   The E.W. Scripps Co. has announced its plans to sell the  Rocky Mountain News . Unless a buyer emerges, Colorado’s longest running business may see its doors close after 150 years, leaving more than 200 tax-paying, voting Coloradans out of work. I want to save the Rocky, and I need your help.   I ask that you work to ensure that the Department of Justice performs its due diligence as Scripps moves forward with a sale or a possible closure of the  Rocky Mountain News  and does not rush the sale through the process without proper oversight. An attempted sale during the holiday season in this recession is not a good faith effort to keep the newspaper open.   Please work to ensure that the dissolution of the joint operating agreement that governs the partnership of  The Denver Post  and the  Rocky Mountain News  follows both the spirit and the letter of the law under which it was written, a law that made it the policy of the United States to preserve newspapers.

Write your own e-mail or copy and paste the letter below and add your name at the bottom:   Dear Rep.-elect Coffman:   The E.W. Scripps Co. has announced its plans to sell the  Rocky Mountain News . Unless a buyer emerges, Colorado’s longest running business may see its doors close after 150 years, leaving more than 200 tax-paying, voting Coloradans out of work. I want to save the Rocky, and I need your help.   I ask that you work to ensure that the Department of Justice performs its due diligence as Scripps moves forward with a sale or a possible closure of the  Rocky Mountain News  and does not rush the sale through the process without proper oversight. An attempted sale during the holiday season in this recession is not a good faith effort to keep the newspaper open.   Please work to ensure that the dissolution of the joint operating agreement that governs the partnership of  The Denver Post  and the  Rocky Mountain News  follows both the spirit and the letter of the law under which it was written, a law that made it the policy of the United States to preserve newspapers. Work to ensure that the interests of  Rocky  employees are being considered. And finally work to ensure that Colorados rich cultural heritage, as preserved in the historical archives of the  Rocky Mountain News , lives on.   As the elected advocate of  Rocky Mountain News  employees and readers in Washington, you have the power to keep our state’s rich, strong journalistic voice intact and to keep Coloradans employed.

The final tax payments for 2008  the last year of the tangible personal   property tax for the vast majority of businesses in Ohio  are due to county   treasurers by Monday, Sept. 22, unless extended locally.                                         Since the usual   due date for payments of Sept. 20 falls on a Saturday this year, it is   automatically extended until Monday. Individual county treasurers may further   extend the deadline, depending on local circumstances.                                         The upcoming   payment deadline marks another milestone in the elimination of the tax, a key   element of tax reforms enacted in 2005 by the Ohio General Assembly and embraced   by Governor Ted Strickland in his 2008-09 state budget plan.                                         For   decades, analysts had criticized the tangible personal property tax as hurting   Ohios ability to attract business investment. In 2009, Ohio will join a select   group of nine other states without a general business tax on tangible personal   property.                                         This is a historic achievement, one that ultimately should   put Ohio in a stronger position to compete for business investment, Ohio Tax   Commissioner Richard A. Levin said.                                         The uniform taxation of personal   property in Ohio can be traced back to 1846. Since 1931, state law has limited   taxes on tangible personal property to machinery, inventory, furniture, fixtures   and other equipment used in the course of conducting business.                                         The   personal property tax is now being phased out by gradually lowering the   percentage of value at which personal property is assessed. The assessment rate   was 6.25 percent for the 2008 tax year. In 2009, the rate drops to zero for all   businesses except certain telephone companies  which are being phased out   according to a different schedule  and certain classes of public utilities that   will continue to pay the tax.                                         Payment schedules vary according to the   taxpayer. For businesses with property in only one county, one-half of their tax   liability was due to their county treasurer on April 30, with the balance to be   paid by next Monday, Sept. 22, unless extended locally. For businesses with   property in more than one county, the total tax liability is due by Monday,   Sept. 22 to county treasurers.                                         The elimination of the personal property   tax, which is Ohios largest local business tax, is expected to save business   owners about $1.6 billion annually. The phase out is part of a larger series of   reforms that also include the gradual elimination of the corporation franchise   tax and a 21 percent, across-the-board cut in state income tax rates. Overall   net savings from the reforms when complete is estimated at $3.9 billion   annually.                                         Revenue from the new commercial activity tax (CAT) is being   used to compensate schools and local governments for lost personal property tax   revenue.

estimates are now available. The estimates, along with guidance on their interpretation can be found on the  ACS page .   Bellevue's Demographics     With a population of 118,100, Bellevue is the Eastsides major urban population center.   Bellevue is the fifth largest city in Washington.(WA State Office of Financial Management)   Bellevue is an increasingly diverse community.  Between 1990 and 2000, Bellevues population identified as Hispanic or of a non-white race rose from about 15 percent to 28 percent, and Bellevues foreign-born population increased from about 13 percent to just under 25 percent.  (U.S. Census Bureau)   Bellevue residents are highly educated and well-suited to todays knowledge economy . In 2000, 54 percent of Bellevue residents 25 years of age and older had at least a bachelors degree, and 53 percent in the workforce were employed in managerial and professional occupations. These percentages increased between 1990 and 2000, remaining higher than for residents in King County as a whole. (U.S. Census Bureau)   Demographic trends and patterns in Bellevue are described in more detail in  Bellevues Census 2000 Report . The City's analysis of the new  American Community Survey estimates  suggests a continuation in Bellevue of many trends seen between 1990 and 2000.   Bellevue's Economic Profile   The  2005 Bellevue Economic Profile  offers  an in-depth analysis of Bellevues economy.     An estimated 130,000 total jobs were located in Bellevue in 2006,   a number that exceeds Bellevues population.   In the last 35 years, Bellevue has been transformed from a primarily residential community with about 20,000 jobs to a major regional economic and employment center.    Bellevue has a diverse local economy.   Approximately two-thirds of the firms doing business in Bellevue are in the services and retail trade. The services sector is an especially important and growing part of the employment base in the Puget Sound region, particularly in Bellevue.    Bellevue has a particularly strong employment base in new economy industries such as engineering and information technology.   The percentage share of jobs in Bellevue in these growing and well-paying industries is significantly higher than in the region as a whole.    Bellevue is a prominent headquarters location.   In 2005, 13 of the states 100 largest public companies and nine of the states largest private companies were headquartered in Bellevue. Some of the  largest headquarters  located in Bellevue include Paccar, Puget Sound Energy, Expedia and Symetra Financial. Bellevue is also home to a number of the fastest growing public and private companies.   There are several major regional employers located in Bellevue.    In Bellevue, as in the region as a whole, small- and medium-sized businesses make up a large majority. However, large employers account for a substantial number of jobs locally and regionally. Entities employing 1,000 or more persons in Bellevue include Bellevue Community College, Bellevue School District, City of Bellevue, Boeing Shared Services Group, Expedia, Overlake Hospital Medical Center, Puget Sound Energy, T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Contact Information                                                                                             Demographics and Economic Trends                       450 110th Ave. NE                             P.O.

Tennessee was the last of the  Southern states  to  secede  from the  Union , but saw more than its share of the devastation resulting from years of warring armies criss-crossing the state. Its rivers were key arteries to the  Deep South , and, from the early days of the war, Union efforts focused on securing control of those transportation routes, as well as major roads and mountain passes such as the  Cumberland Gap .   A large number of important battles occurred in Tennessee, including the vicious fighting at the  Battle of Shiloh , which at the time, was the deadliest battle in American history (it was later surpassed by a number of other engagements). Other large battles in Tennessee included  Stones River ,  Chattanooga ,  Nashville , and  Franklin .   Although the state became a part of the Confederacy, pockets of strong pro-Union sentiments remained throughout the war, particularly in the mountains in  East Tennessee . The  Vice President of the United States ,  Andrew Johnson , was a loyalist, as were a number of congressmen and state politicians. On the Confederate side, significant leaders included noted cavalryman  Nathan B. Forrest  and corps commanders  Leonidas Polk  and  Benjamin F. Cheatham , as well as Governor  Isham Harris .

Initially, most Tennesseans showed little enthusiasm for breaking away from a nation whose struggles it had shared for so long. In 1860, they had voted by a slim margin for the  Constitutional Unionist   John Bell , a native son and moderate who continued to search for a way out of the crisis.   A vocal minority of Tennesseans spoke critically of the Northern states and the Lincoln presidency. ""The people of the South are preparing for their next highest duty  resistance to coercion or invasion,"" wrote the Nashville  Daily Gazette  on  January 5 ,  1861 . The newspaper expressed the view that Florida, Georgia, and Alabama were exercising the highest right of all by taking control of all  forts  and other military establishments within the area  the right to self-defense. [ 1 ]  A pro-secessionist proposal was made in the Memphis  Appeal  to build a fort at  Randolph, Tennessee , on the  Mississippi River . [ 2 ]   Governor  Isham G. Harris  convened an emergency session of the  Tennessee General Assembly  in January 1861. During his speech before the legislative body on January 7, he described the secession of the Southern states as a crisis caused by ""long continued agitation of the slavery question"" and ""actual and threatened aggressions of the Northern States ... upon the well-defined constitutions rights of the Southern citizen."" He also expressed alarm at the growth of the ""purely sectional"" Republican Party, which he stated was bound together by the ""uncompromising hostility to the rights and institutions of the fifteen Southern states."" He identified numerous grievances with the Republican Party, blaming them for inducing slaves to run off by means of the  Underground Railroad ,  John Brown 's raids, and high taxes on slave labor. [ 3 ]   Harris agreed with the idea of popular sovereignty, that only the people within a state can determine whether or not slavery could exist within the boundaries of that state. Furthermore, he regarded laws passed by Congress that made U.S. territories non-slave states as taking territories away from the American people and making them solely for the North, territories from which ""Southern men unable to live under a government which may by law recognize the free negro as his equal"" were excluded. Governor Harris proposed holding a State Convention. A series of resolutions were presented in the  Tennessee House of Representatives  by  William H. Wisener  against the proposal. He declared passing any law reorganizing and arming the state militia to be inexpedient.   In Memphis, Unionists held two torchlight processions to honor their cause. The secessionists replied with their own demonstrations and a celebratory ball. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] That week, on February 9, the state of Tennessee was to vote on whether or not to send delegates to a State Convention that would decide on secession. [ 6 ]  The General Assembly convened by Governor Isham Harris did not believe it had the authority to call a State Convention without a vote of the people. [ 7 ]   In February 1861, 54 percent of the states voters voted against sending delegates to a secession convention, defeating the proposal for a State Convention by a vote of 69,675 to 57,798. If a State Convention had been held, it would have been very heavily pro-Union. 88,803 votes were cast for Unionist candidates and 22,749 votes were cast for Secession candidates. [ 8 ]  That day the American flag was displayed in ""every section of the city,"" with zeal equal to that which existed during the late 1860 presidential campaign, wrote the Nashville  Daily Gazette . [ 9 ]  On the corner across from the newspaper office, a crowd had gathered around a bagpipe player playing  Yankee Doodle , after which ex-mayor John Hugh Smith gave a speech that was received with loud cheers. [ 10 ]   In a letter to Democratic senator  Andrew Johnson , his servant C.O. Faxon surmised that the margin by which the No Convention vote won would have been even greater, had Union men not been afraid that if a State Convention were not called then, then Isham Harris would have again called for a State Convention when more state legislators were ""infected with the secession epidemic."" [ 11 ]   On  March 7 , the Memphis  Daily Appeal  wrote that the abolitionists were attempting to deprive the South of territories won during the  U.S.-Mexican War . It used the argument that the slave states had furnished twice as many volunteers as the free states and territories, but it did not note that slave states were the ones who had supported the war. [ 12 ]   On March 19, the editors of the Clarksville  Chronicle  endorsed a pro-Union candidate for state senator in Robertson, Montgomery, and Stewart counties.  [ 13 ]   On April 12, the Memphis  Daily Appeal  ran a satirical obituary for  Uncle Sam , proclaiming him to have died of ""irrepressible conflict disease,"" after having met Abraham Lincoln. [ 14 ]  One  Robertson County  slave owner complained that she could not rent her slaves out for ""half [of what] they were worth"" because ""the negros think when Lincoln takes his last, they will all be free."" [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Reaction to the attack on Fort Sumter   With the attack on  Fort Sumter  on  April 12 ,  1861 , followed by President  Abraham Lincoln s call for 75,000 volunteers to put the seceded states back into line, public sentiment turned dramatically against the Union.   Historian Daniel Crofts thus reports:     Unionists of all descriptions, both those who became Confederates and those who did not, considered the proclamation calling for seventy-five thousand troops ""disastrous."" Having consulted personally with Lincoln in March, Congressman  Horace Maynard , the unconditional Unionist and future Republican from East Tennessee, felt assured that the administration would pursue a peaceful policy. Soon after  April 15 , a dismayed Maynard reported that ""the President's extraordinary proclamation"" had unleashed ""a tornado of excitement that seems likely to sweep us all away."" Men who had ""heretofore been cool, firm and Union loving"" had become ""perfectly wild"" and were ""aroused to a phrenzy of passion."" For what purpose, they asked, could such an army be wanted ""but to invade, overrun and subjugate the Southern states."" The growing war spirit in the North further convinced southerners that they would have to ""fight for our hearthstones and the security of home.""   [ 16 ]     Governor  Isham Harris  began military mobilization, submitted an  ordinance  of  secession  to the  General Assembly , and made direct overtures to the  Confederate  government.     [ edit ]   Tennessee secedes   In a  June 8 ,  1861  referendum, East Tennessee held firm against separation, while  West Tennessee  returned an equally heavy majority in favor. The deciding vote came in  Middle Tennessee , which went from 51 percent against secession in February to 88 percent in favor in June.   Having ratified by popular vote its connection with the fledgling  Confederacy , Tennessee became the last state to withdraw from the Union.   People in East Tennessee, the only area of the state that did not practice slavery on a wide scale, continued to be firmly against Tennessee's move to leave the Union, as were many in other parts of the state, particularly in historically Whig portions of West Tennessee. [ 17 ]  Tennesseans representing twenty-six East Tennessee counties met twice in Greeneville and Knoxville and agreed to secede from Tennessee. They petitioned the state legislature in Nashville, which denied their request to secede and sent Confederate troops under  Felix Zollicoffer  to occupy East Tennessee and prevent secession. East Tennessee supplied significant quantities of troops for the Federal army, while the rest of Tennessee was a prime recruiting area for the Confederate army.  (See also  Nickajack ).  Many East Tennesseans engaged in guerrilla warfare against state authorities by burning bridges, cutting telegraph wires, and spying. [ 18 ]  East Tennessee became an early base for the  Republican Party .     [ edit ]   Battles          The Third Battle of Chattanooga was fought November 23-25, 1863.       Many battles were fought in the state, most of them Union victories.     [ edit ]   Twin Rivers Campaign of 1862   Control of the  Cumberland  and  Tennessee Rivers  was important in gaining control of Tennessee during the age of  steamboats . Tennessee relied on northbound riverboats to receive staple commodities from the Cumberland and Tennessee valleys. [ 19 ]  The idea of using the rivers to breach the Confederate defense line in the West was well-known by the end of 1861; Union gunboats had been scanning Confederate fort-building on the twin rivers for months before the campaign. [ 20 ]   Ulysses S. Grant  and the  United States Navy  captured control of the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers in February 1862 and held off the  Confederate  counterattack at  Shiloh  in April of the same year.     [ edit ]   Capture of Memphis   Capture of  Memphis  and  Nashville  gave the Union control of the Western and Middle  sections . Control was confirmed at the battle of  Murfreesboro  in early January 1863.   After Nashville was captured (the first Confederate state capital to fall) Andrew Johnson, an East Tennessean from  Greeneville , was appointed military governor of the state by Lincoln. During this time, the military government abolished  slavery .   The Confederates continued to hold East Tennessee despite the strength of Unionist sentiment there, with the exception of pro-Confederate  Sullivan County .     [ edit ]   Fall 1863   The Confederates besieged  Chattanooga  in early fall 1863 but were driven off by Grant in November. Many of the Confederate defeats can be attributed to the poor strategic vision of General  Braxton Bragg , who led the  Army of Tennessee  from  Shiloh  to Confederate defeat at Chattanooga.     [ edit ]   Fall 1864   The last major battles came when the Confederates invaded in November 1864 and were checked at  Franklin , then totally destroyed by  George Thomas  at Nashville in December.

Harris               [ edit ]   Reconstruction   After the war, Tennessee adopted a constitutional amendment forbidding property in men  February 22 ,  1865 ; [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  ratified the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  on  July 18 ,  1866 ; and was the first state readmitted to the Union on  July 24 ,  1866 .   Because it ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, Tennessee was the only state that seceded from the Union that did not have a military governor during  Reconstruction . That did not placate people who could not accept the results of the war. Many whites resisted efforts to expand suffrage and other civil rights to freedmen. During slavery whites had convinced themselves that the institution was justified. Some whites could not concede to a world in which former slaves should have equal rights under the law. Like many other peoples defeated in war, they were unwilling to give up any of the power they formerly held.   When, in 1867, the state Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of African American suffrage, some groups grew more agitated. The  Nashville Republican Banner  on  January 4 ,  1868 , published an editorial calling for a revolutionary movement of white Southerners to unseat the one-party state rule of the  Republican Party  and restore the racial subjugation of the region's blacks.   ""In this State,"" the paper argued, ""reconstruction has perfected itself and done its worst. It has organized a government which is as complete a closed corporation as may be found; it has placed the black man over the white as the agent and prime-move of domination; it has constructed a system of machinery by which all free guarantees, privileges and opportunities are removed from the people.... The impossibility of casting a free vote in Tennessee short of a revolutionary movement ... is an undoubted fact.""   The  Banner  urged readers to ignore the presidential election and instead put energies into building ""a local movement here at home"" that would end Republican rule. [ 23 ]   The frenzied nature of this account can be seen with the perspective of some facts: according to the 1860 census, African Americans comprised only 25% of the state's population in 1860, so they could not dominate politics. Two or three blacks served in the Tennessee legislature during Reconstruction, while more served as state and city officers. The editors of the Nashville  Banner  may have been reacting to increased participation by African Americans on the city council, but the maximum number of seats they held was about one-third.
