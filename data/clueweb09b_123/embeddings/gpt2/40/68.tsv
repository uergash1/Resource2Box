Do potential adopters understand the risks of this designer dog?     Most Chiweenie owners will agree that these little dogs can be one of the most loving, intelligent, and adorable companion dogs ever. However, those interested in acquiring a Chiweenie should be aware of the pitfalls.   The Chihuahua/Dachshund cross is sometimes called a designer breed. In reality, it is not a pure breed and does not conform to a breed standard.   The  Chihuahua  Half   The Chihuahua is the smallest breed of dog. Chihuahuas were first discovered in Mexico and are a warm weather breed. Preferring sunlight and warmth, they love to  sunbathe  or tunnel under the covers. For this reason, they also make great lap dogs.   Chihuahuas tend to bond closely with their favorite person or with another Chihuahua and can be very protective for their size. They do not do well when separated from loved ones and may refuse to eat. As with many of the toy breeds, they can suffer from  hypoglycemia.   The Dachshund Half   The Dachshund is recognized as a hound by the AKC and was originally bred for hunting badgers. Their long, low and lean body allows them to tunnel into the badger’s den.   Dachshunds are energetic, courageous, and sometimes protective of their territory or favorite person. They are generally tough little dogs but can suffer from disc disease or disc injury due to the elongated spinal column. Their weight should be carefully controlled.   The Blend   The Chiweenie will likely have characteristics from both parents. They are small dogs and if the Chihuahua was crossed with a miniature Dachshund, this Chiweenie will be even smaller. Most of them inherit the long spinal column of the Dachshund. Some have prick ears and some have floppy ears. The Chiweenie tends to shed very little.   Due to their tiny size, they are easy to scoop up and take almost anywhere. This, and the fact that Chiweenies grow very attached to their owner, makes them a great lap dog and companion dog.   Small dogs are sometimes thought of as ‘yappy’ but Chiweenies are not usually excessively so. They do make great alert dogs and can be a bit protective as well.   These little dogs inherit the desire to ‘tunnel’ from both the Chihuahua and the Dachshund so Chiweenie owners can expect to find their tiny dog burrowed under the covers or snuggled into a pile of laundry still warm from the dryer. With their cold nature, warm clothing and booties are a necessity in winter, even for those quick potty breaks.   Acquiring a Chiweenie   Some dog experts warn that ‘designer dogs’ generally come from breeders that have no interest in breed conformation and seek only to profit from the catchy designer name. They claim that many of these dogs come from  puppy mills  that have more interest in turning a profit than in providing quality housing, food, and vet care for the dogs.   Since inbreeding and early neglect can cause a lifetime of health and behavior issues, it is recommended that those interested in adopting a Chiweenie check with a rescue where all the dogs are evaluated by a veterinarian.   Chiweenie owners who understand their dog and provide proper care can enjoy many years of companionship with this loving pet.

We are considering getting one of my neighbors chiweenie pups, and are looking for negative aspects so we know what we are getting into.

It's great that you're considering this adoption so carefully and if you're comfortable with the dog's background and have it checked by a vet, then a Chiweenie can make a wonderful pet.  I know, because I have an adorable rescued Chiweenie.        Dec 19, 2008 9:21 PM    Guest :    Chiweenies are so cute!!!

When I first got him I was told that he was a chiwawa, but as he has grown over the past month I am really starting to believe he is a chiweenie, and I am so happy he is! He has been extremely easy to potty train, does not need a leash, and is the biggest lover EVER! However, he is a little bossy :)~ Also, I have a 2 year old nephew and they are great together, just keep an eye on the kids, they tend to think the little dog is a toy. If you're thinking of getting one, go for it, they are AWESOME!! Oh y, they love chewing on bones and fetching tennis balls.        Dec 25, 2008 7:55 PM    Guest :    We just got a Chiweenie for Christmas. His momma was a 6 pound weener dog and the Daddy was a tea-cup Chi... He supposedly will be about 3-4 lbs. We are trying to figure out the best way to train him. He seems to like to go outside but in Ohio the winters are so very cold... His new Daddy is my 8 year old son and in just 3 short days he has become very protective and attached to his Daddy.      5 Comments                                                                     Print Article     Email Article     View All Articles     How to subscribe to feeds                             about us   •   limelight blog   •   writing jobs   •   careers   •   press room   •   site map   •   terms & conditions   •   privacy policy   •   suite101.de

                        Rock Art, not rock craft.  Rock art is a form of art, some believe it is a craft because we use a meer                                     stone or rock instead of store bought canvas. Rock Artist put lots of time and skill into each of the pieces                                     we paint.  The pieces on this site are priced as Art not as crafts.  If you are interested in buying a piece                                     of art that will bring you many years of enjoyment then please feel free to browse threw my pages. Each piece is a one                                     of a kind, there are no two rocks that are the same although they may look simular.

These are, in fact, simply mixed breeds that are crossed to produce a specific physical appearance, usually easily identified as a cross between the two breeds. The breeders attempt to include only the desirable traits of the two parents while minimizing the chance of physical or health issues between the cross.                                          Some of the more common or popular designer dogs are:     Labradoodle :  A cross between a Labrador retriever and a Standard Poodle. Considered to have the non-shedding and easy care coat of a poodle combined with the poodle's intelligence and the wonderful, loving personality of the Lab.    Porkie :  A cross between a Pug and a Yorkie. A small dog that is heartier than the standard Yorkie with longer hair and the easygoing temperament of the Pug.    Cockapoo :  A cross between a Cocker Spaniel and a Poodle. Often considered an intelligent, low shedding small breed that is great for families.     Schnoodle :  Cross between a Schnauzer and a Poodle, again with an attempt to have an intelligent, non-shedding companion dog.    Daisy Dog :  A three way cross between a poodle and Shih Tzu parent and a Bichon. These dogs are reported to be very calm and excellent companion dogs for traveling or living in small spaces.    Poogle :  Cross between a Poodle and a Beagle. Small sized dog that energetic and easy to train.    Puggle :  Pug and a Beagle. These are very friendly dogs that love to be involved in all aspects of the family.                                         Most of the designer dogs have a poodle in the mix simply because poodles are know to be excellent non-shedding dogs and also are very intelligent. The three different sizes of poodles also make them a great breed for mixing with various dog breeds.   It is important to remember that these crosses have occurred in the past; it is just now that they are being recognized. As with all breeds of dogs there are good breeding dogs and dogs that should not be crossed due to health conditions or temperaments.   A designer dog, also called a hybrid, is not recognized by the Kennel Clubs, although many agencies are trying to develop registries for these breeds. Be aware that many of these dogs are more expensive than either one of their purebred parents, but do not have any standing with breed registries. Many shelter dogs are mixed breeds that are looking for a loving home and are available at a fraction of the cost that some breeders are asking.   Designer dogs may also have a variety of health concerns and conditions. Do not mistakenly believe that all hybrids are naturally healthy and immune from genetic conditions, in fact they may have just as many health concerns as purebred dogs.

Because of this, MAF has funded hundreds of studies since 1950 to address the causes of pain, suffering and diseases in dogs. Below are just a few examples of how we've improved the health and well-being of dogs.  Learn about our current studies .                                              Canine Cancer Campaign :  MAF launched a major cancer initiative to cure dogs of cancer in 10 to 20 years, or the lifetime of a dog. Efforts include a national tumor tissue bank, a clinical trial for bone cancer treatment, and a long–term prevention study. Visit the  Canine Cancer Campaign  website.               First Parvovirus Vaccine :  Foundation funding supported the development of the first parvovirus vaccine, saving the lives of thousands of dogs.               Diets for Dogs with Kidney Failure :  Early Foundation–funded studies helped define the role of protein and phosphorous in the diet of dogs with kidney failure, helping veterinarians to manage the condition with nutrition. A recent study determined that a daily low dose of calcitriol stabilizes kidney function and slows disease progression.               Tests to Identify Blindness Gene :  Scientists identified the gene for progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a group of blinding diseases in dogs. This led to the development of breed–specific DNA tests to help veterinarians and breeders distinguish affected, carrier and normal dogs and breed out these diseases.               Early Lymphoma Detection :  A simple blood test was developed to provide early detection of lymphoma in dogs.               New Drug to Fight Bone Cancer :  Researchers studied a combination of conventional chemotherapy drugs and the drug suramin that appears to provide better treatment than conventional therapy alone and could improve long–term survival of dogs with bone cancer.               Technique to Remove Bladder Stones :  Researchers used a laser lithotripsy technique to remove bladder and urethral stones in dogs. This technique offers veterinarians a minimally invasive alternative to traditional surgery and provides dogs with rapid recovery and minimal discomfort.               Treatment for Heart Abnormalities :  Scientists successfully used radiofrequency catheter ablation to cure dogs with a heart condition known as accessory pathways. Another study used a silicone cuff to treat portosystemic shunts, the second most common congenital cardiovascular abnormality in dogs.

clueweb09-en0008-43-16164	"                                   Home  |  Back To Healthy Horse   ""SPECIAL REPORT"" Taking Care Of Your Horse's Hooves     1.)Pick Out Your Horse's Feet. --- The initial check. --- What to check for. --- If your horse has shoes. --- The best times to check.     1.) I am sure you may have heard the old  saying..no hoof, no  horse! Well, it's one of the truest statements ever made!    We want our horse's hooves to be as healthy as the rest of the horse, actually more so. So, lets get started!     First and foremost:  Pick out your horse's feet every day.   This very simple task will help you ensure that your horse has healthy, disease free hooves for most of his life. It may be a  simple thing and you may not think it will not make a big difference, but it may be the single most important thing you can do for the well being of your horse.    First we will do an initial check of the overall appearance  of the outer hoof. If you would like to see some pictures of healthy horse hooves go to: http://images.google.com and do a search for ""healthy horse hooves"" and you will be able to  get a good idea of what you are looking for in healthy hooves.    --You will want to check for cracks, abscesses and punctures.     --Remove any stones or small objects that may become lodged in  the horse's feet.  Don't forget to check the condition of the  horse's frog and soles, are they too hard or feel mushy?     -- If they are too hard they will need more moisture or a good conditioner    -- If they are mushy your horse may have thrush.     If you shoe your horse make sure you check for loose shoes,  sprung shoes, missing nails and pebbles or debris between the shoe and the hoof.     **Note: We will address all of these issues further as we dig deeper into this report.**   Here is a quick overview of the best times to check your  horse's hooves.    ---Morning Check----  Each morning, remove manure, and check for signs of thrush,  don't forget to check for signs of heat and pulse. If you do this every day, twice a day and after riding or exercise, you will have come a long way to improving your horses condition and overall health.    ---Evening Check---  When you bring your horse in at night it is important to pick your horses feet again! I know it may sound like an unnecessary task, but it is important. Check again for lodged stones,  injuries or bruising that may have happened during the day.    ---Before and After Riding or Exercise Check---  Yes, I know you already did this today, but it never hurts to check again. You don't want to run the risk of causing soreness or injury to your horse because they have a piece of debris  lodged in their hoof. Plus your horse will be more comfortable and compliant if they are not in pain. Which means that you will both have a more enjoyable experience.      2.) Nutrition and Healthy Hooves. --- The simple way. --- Horses that don't have free range. --- Horses that work hard. --- Consistent exercise.    2.) How Nutrition Plays A Part In Healthy Hooves    Proper nutrition helps your horse grow the best possible hooves. Just like people, some horses naturally have better hooves than others. Your horse may have great feet but if he doesn't the  following information may help:    Grass and hay is the simple way.   Free choice grass-hay diet is as simple as it gets but the most beneficial for the horse. Horses that are moderately worked and  exercised can get all their energy needs from free choice  pasture or a good quality hay.    Many nutrients are found in the 'free range' choice, such as zinc, sulphur, copper, phosphorus, calcium and more. If your  horse has free range access the horse will get all the nutrients it needs to grow healthy strong hooves.    Many horses do not have free range access and if this is the  case with your horse, you may want to supplement the horses' feed with biotin. It contains all the nutrients your horse needs to grow strong healthy hooves. Most horses will benefit from  this supplement. It is important to use this supplement for at  least six months to a year. Because that is how long it will  take for you to be able to see any of the benefits in new hoof growth.   Horses that work hard, such as  endurance racing, sports, etc. may need a higher level of energy. You may want to fine tune his  diet with more protein and fiber. With any change in feed rations, it should be gradual, the rule of thumb is a 10% exchange over  4-7 weeks. Ask your veterinarian what the best feeding program for your horse's nutritional needs.   Give your horse consistent exercise. Work on good surfaces, especially at walk and trot, which increases circulation to your horse's hooves and promotes health and growth.      3.) Check for Signs of Cracks. --- Superficial or hairline cracks.  --- More serious crack. --- What damage can it do? --- Treatment and prevention.    3.) Check for Signs of Cracks   Hoof cracks are a common problem in horse's hooves. Less severe are hairline cracks which  extend from the  ground up toward the horse's coronet band and are usually caused by irregular or no trimming also excessive dryness  of the hoof.    More serious cracks. What to look for.   More serous are cracks starting at the coronary band and  continuing downward. They may be due to an injury of the hoof forming tissue of the coronary band itself. If you notice a  crack in your horse's hoof, call your farrier and describe it's location and size so he can decide whether it needs attention  now or if it can wait until the next regular visit.     What damage can it do?   If cracks that are large enough for bacteria to enter are left  untreated, they can cause infection to the sensitive tissues of the hoof and do damage to it's structure which can ultimately lead severe lameness or worse.    Treatment and prevention.   For superficial cracks using a good Biotin supplement and  practicing good daily maintenance will help.   For more severe cracks your farrier may advise shoeing or the  application of fiberglass or plastic to the hoof wall until the  crack grows out.   Hoof cracks can be prevented by regular hoof trimming. Keep your horse's feet from becoming excessively dry and hard.  There are many hoof dressings on the market today that will help  to keep your horses feet soft and moist. A periodic hoof soaking in mud will do wonders for your horses dry feet. If your horses do not have access to mud you can try letting their water tub  overflow a little, just enough for a small muddy puddle.      4.) Puncture Wounds What Can They Hurt? --- What damage they can do? --- What not to do if something is stuck. --- Signs of an abscess. --- When to call your vet.    4.) Puncture Wounds What Can They Hurt?    Looking for signs of a puncture:   Puncture wounds are fairly common among horses. Some puncture wounds if not detected early enough may cause severe lameness or a permanent disability. Death due to tetanus may also occur if wounds are not properly treated.    An untreated puncture wound will allows for bacteria to  enter the horses system resulting in mild to severe infection. Abscesses can develop in as little as two days or as long as  month after the initial injury.   Picking your horses feet on a daily basis will catch this  potential problem before severe damage results. Sometimes a  nail, wire or other object may pierce your horse's sole. It may  fall out and the entry wound will probably be invisible by the time you pick his feet and you will not be aware of it until is shows up as an abscess.    In some cases the object remains in place, to be discovered when  you brush the last bits of dirt from the sole.     ***DON'T PULL IT OUT***   Put your horse in his stall. Protect the punctured foot, and  help  the foreign object stay put either by wrapping or with  a slip-on medication boot. Then call your veterinarian right  away!   An x-ray of the foot can show how far the object has penetrated and which structures are involved. If you pick your horse's feet out regularly, you'll find the problem within a few hours of its occurrence. Then your veterinarian can remove the object and  advise a course of treatment.   If your horses digital pulse feels stronger than usual or its foot is warmer than normal to the touch, this is a sign of a  possible abscess inside the hoof. An abscess may result from an  over looked sole puncture, badly placed shoeing nail or from a  bruise or injury.      *Important*   If you find heat and a stronger than usual pulse in BOTH front feet, and your horse is shifting uncomfortably from foot to  foot, call your veterinarian immediately! These are signs of Laminitis, an inflammatory condition that can cause severe  hoof damage and if not treated promptly it can be fatal.       5.) Horses With Shoes. --- When to check their shoes. --- How often will they need shod? --- What to look for? --- Extra things you should know.     5.) Horses With Shoes.   If your horse is shod, check his shoes each time you pick out  his feet.    As a general rule a horse will need shod every 4-6 weeks. A  healthy hoof grows approximately - inch a month. If you  leave shoes on too long the hoof will grow out of proportion  which may result in lameness. If you do not shoe your horses'  feet they still need periodic trimming every 6-8 weeks. If your horse is shod you will want to look for:    What to look for?    -- A sprung shoe:  A shoe that is lifted away from the hoof and is not sitting flat.    -- A missing shoe or shoes:  If your horse is missing a shoe do not ride or exercise him. Call your blacksmith right away and keep  your horse stalled or in an enclosure until the blacksmith arrives.    -- A bent or slightly shifted shoe:  If the shoe has moved to one  side or the other, it has shifted. This can cause damage to the sensitive hoof structure of the horses' foot when weight is applied.    -- A loose shoe or risen clinches.  If you see the ends of the  nails your blacksmith trimmed and clinched are sticking out from  the hoof this is a sign that the shoe is loosening. This may  cause an injury. Call your blacksmith and schedule an  appointment.    -- Look for debris and small pebbles between the shoe and sole of the hoof.    -- Signs of puncture wounds, bruising, abscess or thrush.   A couple of other things you should know.   Mud is extremely hard on your horses' shoes. If at all possible keep your horses out of deep mud. The suction of deep mud or  water can easily drag off a shoe it is already loosened.   Ask your farrier to teach you how to remove shoes. I hear your gasp! But it is important that you know how to do this incase there  comes a time that your farrier can't get to you and the shoes  need to come off. If you can remove a sprung or loose shoe,  you may save your horse unnecessary pain and hoof damage.    6.) Brief Overview of Diseases of the Hoof.  --- Thrush.  --- Laminitis. --- Founder. --- White Line Disease. --- Navicular Syndrome. --- Equine Scratches    6.) Brief Overview of Diseases of the Hoof.   I feel it is important to add this section of the report so that you can become familiar with the different disease that can affect the hoof areas of the horse. This is by no means a  complete list. It is only an overview of the more common  diseases. To find out more about the individual diseases and their treatment please consult your veterinarian or farrier.     -- Thrush   Thrush is bacterial condition. It is an invasion of bacteria and moisture into the sole of the horses foot. The front and back  feet may be affected. Horses that are confined to a stall or  small area are more prone to thrush than other horses.   Some horses, especially those with upright, narrow feet and deep clefts tend to trap more dirt, debris, and manure than other horses therefore they are more predisposed to thrush  even when well cared for.     What are the signs of thrush?   Most often there will be a foul smell and dark black ooze coming from the cleft of the frog. Keep in mind that in early  stages there may be very little or no smell at all. Check for any tenderness. If the horses feet are tender it may be a  possible sign. Thrush also causes the bottom of the hoof to  become soft and crumbly. If left untreated for long the frog will become cheesy in texture and rot off. In extreme cases  the heel begins to split and to bleed.       -- Laminitis   Laminitis is an infection of the laminae which are the soft tissues that connect the coffin bone to the hoof wall. This results in swelling of the lamina. The condition may range  severity from mild to acute and usually occurs in the horses front feet but can also affect the back feet.       -- Founder   Founder is an inflammatory condition of the laminae. Some  consider founder and Laminitis to be one and the same while others firmly disagree, and believe that it is a direct result of repeated bouts with Laminitis. Either way it is very painful and destructive for the horses health.    There are different types of founder. Grain founder seems to be  the most detrimental. Grass founder which in most cases is less severe. Both can be linked to carbohydrate overload or to much sugar in their diet.  Road founder which happens when horses are  ridden on hard surfaces over long periods of time. Foal founder  happens when the mare doesn't deliver the placenta.     -- White Line Disease   It can be recognized on the sole of the hoof as a powdery white line that runs along the hoof wall. In the beginning stages of white line disease it may stay localized to one area, but as it  progresses it can spread to other areas of the hoof wall.    As it advances it will cause the separation of the hoof wall from the sole and will allow bacteria and fungi to enter the  hoof which will cause deterioration of the inner part of the hoof wall.      -- Navicular Syndrome   Navicular Syndrome occurs when the navicular bone becomes  immobile and causes poor blood flow within the hoof due to improper care. Problems that arise as a result can be high  heels, overlaid bar or long toes. It also affects the bone and tendons of the front feet.     -- Equine Scratches  Although this is not a disease of the hoof I think it needs to be mentioned in this report because it is an infection of the lower leg that can affect your horse and eventually lead to lameness.   Scratches is a skin problem caused by fungi and bacteria. This  is found mostly in the lower legs. It is most prevalent in  horses that are wet often or in contact with mud. The skin will become crusted, scabby and thickened. In severe cases the skin  may ooze and the lower leg may swell. If left untreated the  horse will become lame.       7.) Tips to Help Ensure Healthy Hooves --- Preventing Laminitis --- Preventing Thrush --- For Hauling --- Supplements for Healthy Hooves.      7.) Tips to Help Ensure Healthy Hooves   Schedule regular visits, usually every 4-6 weeks. Horses  that have free-choice pasture may only need their hooves trimmed  every 6-10 weeks depending on hoof growth. Ask your blacksmith.    Pick your horses feet daily. Horses that are stalled   constantly need to have the wet manure picked out, if not it can cause thrush or canker.   Practice good stable management and most of diseases of the hoof  can be prevented.   Make changes to the horses routine and diet gradually and progressively. Rapid change can lead to stress and disease.  Avoid feeding in excess and keep your horse at a reasonable weight. Overweight horses are more prone to hoof disease.   Avoid grass blooms on your pasture. They can cause founder. Pull your horses off the fields and onto dry lots if you have to. Feed  them hay in the morning and only turn horses out after the lushness and dew is off the grass.   Keep grain in closed bins and the door to the feed room shut at all times.   Pay attention to breed and body types; some are more likely  to get Laminitis than others. Be particularly careful with  ponies and horses that have thick necks..   Give horses unlimited access to fresh, clean water, except immediately after exercise, when the amount should be regulated.   If at all possible keep your horses out of deep mud.  Hours of standing in mud encourages 'thrush' or 'scratches'  (a skin infection in the fetlock area that can cause lameness).    Keep your horses' stall clean and dry. A wet-moist stall can  cause bacteria to grow and bacteria causes 'thrush' and promotes fungus and infection.    Don't shoe your horse unless necessary. There are many  alternatives to shoeing. The horses' foot will adapt to whatever environmental surface the horse is standing on whether is be  hard packed ground, small stones, gravel etc.   Use shipping boots or wraps with bell boots to protect your horses hooves during hauling. This is very  important for  maintaining healthy hooves and preventing injury. The rocking  motion of the trailer combined with the horses constantly  shifting feet can cause tremendous damage.    -- Supplements for Healthy Hooves.   DL-methionine is one of the most important amino acids for  hoof growth.   Biotin is important for hoof growth and repair. It helps in the utilization of proteins. Which helps prevent eczema and  dermatitis.    When deciding on a supplement for your horse look for one that is a good source of A,D,E to help grow healthy hooves.   Give your horse access a salt/mineral block that has a good mix of calcium and phosphorous to prevent them form becoming deficient.    8.) In Closing.  --- Important Note.       8.) In Closing.   I would just like to say that it is extremely important to  maintain the health of your horse to ensure the growth of  healthy hooves.    If you think your horse has an early case of thrush, Laminitis  or another harmful disease, but you are unsure, be sure to ask  your  blacksmith or veterinarian to look at their feet right away before serious damage can occur. They should be able to easily  diagnose and recommend proper treatment for you.    *Disclaimer of Liability*  This report is for informational purposes only.

clueweb09-enwp00-72-00831	"                     Dog Days          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Dog Day )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The phrase  Dog Days  or "" the dog days of summer "", refers to the hottest, most sultry days of summer. In the  northern hemisphere  they usually fall between early July and early September whilst in the  Southern hemisphere  they are usually between January and early March. The actual dates vary greatly from region to region, depending on  latitude  and  climate . Dog Days can also define a time period or event that is very hot or stagnant, or marked by dull lack of progress.           Contents       1   The name   2   The dates   3   Other locations   4   Other references   5   See also               [ edit ]   The name   The term ""Dog Days"" was used by the Greeks (see, e.g., Aristotle's Physics, 199a2), as well as the  ancient Romans  (who called these days  caniculares dies  (days of the dogs)) after  Sirius  (the ""Dog Star""), the brightest star in the heavens besides the  Sun . The dog days of summer are also called canicular days.   Popularly believed to be an evil time ""when the seas boiled, wine turned sour, dogs grew mad, and all creatures became languid, causing to man burning fevers, hysterics, and phrensies"" - Bradys  Clavis Calendarium,  1813. [ citation needed ] [ page number needed ]   The Dog Days originally were the days when Sirius, the Dog Star, rose just before or at the same time as sunrise ( heliacal rising ), which is no longer true owing to  precession of the equinoxes . The ancients sacrificed a brown dog at the beginning of the Dog Days to appease the rage of Sirius, believing that the star was the cause of the hot, sultry weather.     [ edit ]   The dates   The Old Farmer's Almanac  lists the traditional timing of the Dog Days as the 40 days beginning  July 3  and ending  August 11 , coinciding with the ancient heliacal (at sunrise) rising of the Dog Star, Sirius.   According to  The Book of Common Prayer  (1552), the ""Dog Daies"" begin on  July 6  and end on  August 17 .     [ edit ]   Other locations   By contrast, ""Dog Days"" as defined herein do not occur at all in the  southern hemisphere , for there even when the star is least favorably placed for viewing (around  July 1 ), it still will be briefly visible from the  southern hemisphere  both in the east before dawn and again in the west after dusk. Throughout most of  Antarctica  Sirius is  circumpolar ; that is to say, constantly above the horizon.   In the northern hemisphere, the further north one goes, the longer Sirius remains invisible each year, and beyond a  latitude  of approximately 74N (to the north of any part of mainland Europe or North America) the star never appears above the horizon at all.   The period from  July 23  to  August 23  is called ""Rtmnad"" in  Sweden  and ""Mtkuu"" in  Finland , both literally meaning ""rotting-month"", due to the risk of foodstuff spoiling due to the high temperature.   In Tamil Nadu and some parts of India it is referred as ""Kathiri Veil"" or "" Akni Nakchathram"". It lasts for 28 days in April or May.     [ edit ]   Other references   For the ancient  Egyptians , Sirius appeared just before the season of the  Nile 's flooding, so they used the star as a ""watchdog"" for that event. Since its rising also coincided with a time of extreme heat, the connection with hot, sultry weather was made for all time: ""Dog Days bright and clear / indicate a happy year. / But when accompanied by rain, / for better times our hopes are vain."" [ citation needed ]   The phrase is mentioned in the short story ""The Bar Sinister"" by  Richard Harding Davis . The main character, who is a street dog, explains ""but when the hot days come, I think they might remember that those are the dog days, and leave a little water outside in a trough, like they do for the horses.""   In recent years, the phrase ""Dog Days"" or ""Dog Days of Summer"" have also found new meanings. The term has frequently been used in reference to the American  stock market (s). Typically, summer is a very slow time for the stock market, and additionally, poorly performing stocks with little future potential are frequently known as ""dogs."" [ citation needed ]   A casual survey will usually find that many people believe the phrase is in reference to the conspicuous laziness of domesticated dogs (who are in danger of overheating with too much exercise) during the hottest days of the summer. When speaking of ""Dog Days"" there seems to be a connotation of lying or ""dogging"" around, or being ""dog tired"" on these hot and humid days. Although these meanings have nothing to do with the original source of the phrase, they may have been attached to the phrase in recent years due to common usage or  misunderstanding of the origin of the phrase .   The  feast day  of  Saint Roch , the  patron saint  of dogs, is  August 16 .

They cool off by panting; the air cools the mucous membranes and blood vessels in their mouth and tongue. Extreme cases of heat stroke lead to the disruption of the dog’s internal cooling mechanism, and they quickly go into cardiovascular shock, which is life-threatening.  Cars are the worst culprit. Windows left open do not ensure the air flow needed, and the hothouse effect is very rapid! If you absolutely must leave your dog in the car, park only in the shade with windows open (so that they cannot jump out), and NEVER for more than 7 - 10 minutes. They must have access to cool, clean water at all times and be able to avoid direct heat by providing shade if outdoors, or a fan if left in an apartment during the hottest part of the day. Puppies and older dogs are more susceptible to heat stroke. If you suspect your pet has heat stroke, this is an emergency situation and should be treated by your veterinarian immediately.    Some of the signs to watch for include:    1) unusual sluggishness or unresponsiveness,    2) pale or dark red gums, possibly very dry and    3) erratic breathing.    Treatment:     NEVER ICE YOUR PET.  THIS WILL CAUSE THE BLOOD VESSELS IN THE BODY TO CONSTRICT TO FAST AND AFFECT BLOOD FLOW IN THE BODY    Immediate correction of hyperthermia:    Spray with water or immerse in water before transporting to veterinary facility    Stop cooling procedures when temperature reaches 103°F, to avoid hypothermia.    Give artificial respiration support if required.    This is a wonderful time of year to take your dog with you to enjoy the outdoors, and hopefully as more owners become aware of how dangerous and rapidly heat stroke can occur, there will be more pets having a safe summer!                      Back To Top Of Page         Home  -  Seasonal Info  -  Online Resources  -  Library Directory  -  Pet Vet  -  Contact Us  -  Site Map         Columbia Animal Hospital @ Hickory Ridge  10788 Hickory Ridge Road   -   Columbia, MD 21044  ph: 410-730-2122  -  ph: 301-596-5549  -  fax: 410-992-9511    Columbia Animal Hospital @ Centre Park  Route 100 & Centre Park Drive  -  Columbia, MD  21045  ph: 410-995-9077  -  ph: 301-621-6322  -  fax: 410-884-0339   e-mail:  info@petshealth.com    WebConnection, A Web Design Group, maintains this Web Site.

Dogs do not tolerate high temperatures as well as       humans. They depend upon rapid breathing to exchange warm air for cool       air. Accordingly when air temperature is close to body temperature, cooling       by rapid breathing is not and efficient process. Dogs with airway disease       also have difficulty with excess heat.                     Common situations that predispose to overheating or heat stroke in dogs         are:                    1. Being left in a car in hot weather.                    2. Being confined on concrete runs; chained without shade in hot weather.                    3. Being of a short-nosed breed, especially a Bulldog or Pug.                    4. Being muzzled while put under a dryer (this can happen in a grooming         parlor).                    5. Suffering from airway disease or any condition that impairs breathing.                    Heat stroke begins with rapid, frantic, noisy breathing. The tongue and         mucus membranes are bright red, the saliva is thick and tenacious and         the dog frequently vomits. Its rectal temperature is high, sometimes         over 106 degrees F. The cause of the problem usually is evident by the         typical appearance of the dog; it can be confirmed by taking its temperature.                    If the condition is allowed to go unchecked, the dog becomes unsteady         and staggers, has diarrhea that often is bloody and becomes progressively         weaker. Coma and death ensue.                     Treatment:  Emergency measures must begin at once. Mild cases respond         to moving the dog to a cooler surrounding, such as an air-conditioned         building or car. If the dog's temperature is over 104 degrees F, or if         unsteady on its feet, the dog should be cooled by immersion in a tub         of cold water. If this is impossible, hose your dog down with a garden         hose. For a temperature over 106 degrees F, or if the dog is near collapse,         give a cold water enema. A more rapid temperature drop is imperative.         Cool to a rectal temperature of 103 degrees F.                    Heat stroke can be associated with swelling of the throat. This aggravates         the problem. A cortisone injection by your veterinarian may be required         to treat this.                    Prevention:                    1. Do not expose dogs with airway disease or impaired breathing to         prolonged heat.                    2. Restrict exercise during the heat of the day in summer.                    3. Breed dogs in air-conditioned quarters.                    4. Crate a dog only in an open wire cage.                    5. Provide shade and cool water to dogs living in outdoor runs.

Pomeroy       Reprinted with permission from  Massachusetts Horse .             Nearly 2,000 years ago, a cruelly simple war device — the caltrop, or horse crippler — stopped drivers and riders in their tracks and forced them to address protecting one of their most critical assets: their horses’ hooves.       Caltrops, designed brutally similar to “jacks” of the children’s game, consist of three or four approximately four-inch tall spikes that, no matter how thrown, maintain one spike in a vertical position, ready to cripple a horse when stepped upon. Used as early as 4th-century-b.c. Rome, caltrops were mentioned by Vegetius in his De Re Militari: “The armed chariots used in war by Antiochus at first terrified the Romans, but they afterwards made a jest of them . . . Roman soldiers rendered them useless by covering the field of battle with caltrops, and the horses that drove the chariots, running full speed on them, were infallibly destroyed.” Ranked as one of the most effective weapons of all time, the Massachusetts colonists called them “crows feet” and, during the American Revolution, they were scattered by the British along the last mile into Boston when they evacuated the city in 1776.       These devices also prompted some of the earliest horseshoes because no matter how large the army, it was only as strong as its weakest link — the vulnerable underside of its horses’ hooves. The inspiration for the shoe sprang, in part, from a desire to protect horses from the crippling caltrop. Sixteen centuries later, owners are still concerned about hoof protection, and some are removing nailed-in shoes to go au naturel. More than just pulling shoes to go barefoot, the trend toward encouraging natural hoof shape and wear follows an outline dictated in part by wild horses and supported by anecdotal evidence from hoof care professionals who endorse a natural trim.       Whether you shoe or trim your horse, the goal is the same: to offer your beloved companion the most comfortable and beneficial care possible. In the interest of offering both sides of what has become a complicated issue, Horse Sense presents a two-part series on shod and unshod options, beginning where it all began, with a shoe-free hoof.       Barefoot or Natural    Shoe-free is a carefully chosen description because, our experts note, barefoot and natural are not synonymous. The term barefoot often implied neglect, says Yvonne Welz, founder of TheHorsesHoof.com. “Horses that went barefoot, such as youngsters, broodmares, and lame horses, were not used. A barefoot horse was not a performance horse, and little attention was paid to improving hoof form and function. Natural trim was a phrase developed to indicate a hoof trimmed to respect natural shape and function. Wild-horse studies helped develop an ideal for domesticated horses that re-creates the functionality of a wild hoof. Barefoot horses could now be performance horses.”       There are different trims. Natural trimmer Jennifer Rizzo, of Waltham, says, “Natural trim and barefoot are used interchangeably, but trims may follow different guidelines and vary significantly. My trim, which I refer to as a natural barefoot trim, accounts for physiological factors and terrain.”       One trim that has gained attention is the Strasser trim, which many refer to as a clinic trim, for pathologically lame horses. Named for its founder, the German veterinarian Dr. Hiltrud Strasser, the trim bears certain hallmarks: A horse is initially trimmed twice weekly; the hoof is kept short and flexible so that circulation is optimized; and there are specific instructions regarding daily hoof soaking, hand-walking on rubber flooring, alternative therapies, and bodywork. “It is a difficult, technical, and powerful trim,” says Yvonne. “In the right hands, it can completely transform a hoof.”       Betsy Merritt, of Barefoot Performance in Williamsburg, credits a Strasser trim with relieving her Welsh/Morgan mare, Morning Star, of chronic laminitis. “I have had great success using the method,” she says. “Even horses that have never worn shoes show improvement in hoof quality and growth, showing me that it is not enough to just take shoes off and follow natural hoof care principles without [also doing] proper, regular trimming.”       Good trims done badly have led to skepticism about this approach. “An incorrect trim is often why an owner has a negative impression of going barefoot,” says Jennifer. “An incorrect trim may involve removal of sole needed to protect inner structures, or failure to remove excess wall. It may utilize improper landmarks for determining balance, such as pastern or hairline angle, or a subjective ideal.”       For healthy, or “middle-ground” horses, there is a modified, or field trim, as developed by those who have further adjusted their technique after initially training under experts like Dr. Strasser. Betsy, who was Strasser-certified in 2002, modifies her approach to different terrain and situations to achieve a trim “specific to each horse’s needs,” she says.       “A field trim is a sophisticated version of a generic barefoot trim,” says Yvonne. “Some incorporate wild-horse trim aspects into their technique.” Why wild horses as the model? The average wild horse travels 20 miles a day over sandy and rocky terrain, and from birth develops a hoof that is short and wide, and has thick walls with rounded bottoms, low heels, and a callused sole and frog. In emulating the wild hoof, the natural trim seeks to keep the hoof short, maximize sole and frog contact with the ground, and encourage outdoor activity over varied footing to toughen soles. For those who remember going barefoot over summer vacation, the theory is similar: The soles of the horse, like the soles of our bare feet, toughen up in response to their terrain.       Baring All    “A barefoot horse with healthy hooves can feel the ground better, is more sure-footed, usually moves more freely, has better traction on most surfaces, and enjoys dramati-cally reduced concussion on hard ground,” notes natural hoof specialist and driving trainer Heike Bean, of Vermont. Indeed, a 1984 University of Zurich (Switzerland) dissertation by Luca Bein demonstrated that a hoof wearing a steel shoe lacked 60 to 80 percent of its natural shock absorption; it also showed that a shod hoof walking on asphalt received triple the impact force as an unshod hoof trotting on the same surface.       Betsy’s Arabian gelding Shadow is still going strong at age 26. Before retiring from competitive trail ten years ago, his brittle, soft hooves were always shod, he required splint and bell boots, and Betsy regularly lost points for interference marks or for his being “off” behind. “Since going barefoot, he comes through pleasure rides one hundred percent sound, his hooves are healthy and strong, and he does not interfere.”       Heike advises, “When balancing a hoof, it is of utmost importance to ensure that it lands heel first. Heel-first landing is necessary for ideal joint loading and shock absorption. Toe-first landing stresses ligaments within the hoof capsule and places concussion on structures not suited for this purpose. Driving horses land toe-first going uphill and heel-first going down. This is caused by a locking mechanism in the knee and cannot be altered, but it can be worsened by poor trimming; since driving horses have increased stress on their hooves when pulling a vehicle uphill, timely break over of all four hooves is essential to minimize stress. This factor is often overlooked when shoeing, trimming, or booting a horse.”       Where riding barefoot has elicited better performance in many cases, driving barefoot has faced more limitation. “It is one of the reasons why I stopped competing,” says Heike.  “There were no good boots on the market at the time and, as I could see what shoes were doing to my horses, I could not in good conscience continue. With today’s boot [styles], driving can be done barefoot.”       Giving the Boot    A wrapped hoof bore at least some protection from the caltrop’s fierce spikes, and so the earliest horse boot — a patch of hide that could be tied around the pastern — can credit its invention to the caltrop. In its modern role among barefoot and natural-trim enthusiasts, the boot continues to play a protective role, as well as offering more options in design, affixture, and tread.       Tomas G. Teskey, D.V.M., author of The Unfettered Foot: A Paradigm Change for Equine Podiatry, notes that the onset of many lameness problems coincides with horses reaching maturity and being shod. “Instead of needing shoes, horses are best served with form-fitting boots that protect hooves from excessive wear, concussion, and bruising. They allow a horse to heal more quickly and completely from hoof diseases such as laminitis and founder, navicular disease, quarter cracks, and contracted heels,” he says.       A hoof, comfortably nestled within a boot designed of tough yet elastic materials, is also free to expand and contract, pump blood normally, and torque side to side with each step. Dr. Teskey, a practicing veterinarian in Arizona since 1995, contends that a shod hoof is not allowed normal mechanical movements (hufmechanismus, per Dr. Strasser) and transfers those forces of concussion and torque into joints and limbs, shrinking hooves and exacting a toll on overall health.        At Slypner Gear of New Hampshire, which designs an athletic horse shoe, Mary Watkins says, “We realize our shoe is not appropriate for all horses, so we also carry boots. Boots are primarily chosen for hoof protection.  Soles and hoof walls are protected with all styles; many offer additional protection to the heel bulb, coronary band, and pastern.” Boot choice should consider traction and concussion reduction, and different brands offer different treads. “All boots provide better traction on pavement and smooth rock compared to steel shoes,” Mary says. “Larger treads give an advantage on surfaces such as wet grass and mud.” Depending on the boot style and brand, fastening it to the hoof might employ a bale-type lever and metal cable, an adjustable bungee dial system (similar to ski boots), or Velcro and buckles. Most can be modified with wraps or gaiters (neoprene socks) to improve fit; some models feature drainage holes in the sole, or in icy conditions can be fitted with studs.       “At the Grand Canyon XP Ride [250 miles in five days], it snowed heavily one day, and the horse that won wore boots and the snow did not ball up, [whereas] riders of shod horses had problems. Boots are like having snow tires,” says Karen Chaton, of EasyCare in Nevada, whose Arabian, Granite Chief, in 2005 became the first barefoot horse in American Endurance Riding Conference history to earn the National Mileage Championship, the same year he won the American Horse Association Distance Horse of the Year award.       Whether to protect a bare hoof in a competitive situation or to transition a formerly shod hoof into a more natural, unshod state, Karen says, “Boots are an excellent way to help horses that need protection or during a transition period.”       Finding Common Ground    Since 2004, at Wakewood Farm in New Hampshire, Susan Wood has used barefoot methods to rehabilitate horses considered incurably lame, working under the auspices of BOGHS, a California-based nonprofit lameness research foundation established in 2004 by Robert M. Bowker, V.M.D., Ph.D., and equine industrial entrepreneur Tommy Lee Osha. (BOGHS is an acronym for the names of its founders and collaborators.)       “The environment our horses are asked to live in dictates how their hooves will be,” Susan says. “If a person does endurance, or aggressive trail riding, they may need a shoe, or use a well-fitted boot for a barefoot horse. If shoes are worn for this purpose, the hooves should be given a break from shoes. We like eight weeks on, four weeks off.”       Voicing a middle ground, she adds, “Shoes belong on healthy hooves. One way to attain a healthy hoof is to bring it back to its natural state, provide the tools for it to heal, then re-introduce the previously intolerable environment and allow it to adapt.”       “Everything we do to, and with, our horses is a compromise to their natural lifestyle,” notes Sue Mellen, of the Engaged Frog in Vermont. A founding member of the American Hoof Association (AHA), she sees natural trimmers and traditional horse shoers as capable of finding common ground. “We all trim hooves. Some of us shoe and some of us boot, but we are all trying our best to help the horse.”       Pete Ramey, author of Making Natural Hoof Care Work, and a former farrier, says of the divide between barefoot and horseshoe proponents: “We just want what we have seen is best for the horse. Nature has put an incredibly solid hoof on our horses that performs admirably and dissipates/absorbs impact energy.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  [ back ]                                                                                      View Cart  |  Dealer's Corner  |  Dealer Locator  |  Hoof Care Provider  |  Catalog (PDF)  |  Newsletter Signup  |  Contact Us  |  Site Map                     © 2008 Easy Care, Inc.

With many dogs being abused or abandoned,  dog adoption  centers are mushrooming all over the city. These adoption centers take care of the dogs that have got lost or stolen, those that are victims of accidents and tend to them. Adopting a dog from such an adoption centre is pretty simple provided you have made up your mind for what you are going to do. Let us see some of the reasons why you should adopt a dog from a dog adoption center.      Bringing home a dog changes your life. It is like a new addition to your family. There is not a single low moment when you have your dog around. When you decide to get home a dog, you are getting ready to brace a lifetime of devoted love and faithfulness from your new friend.  Dogs  go to any length to keep their masters happy. Another way of looking at a reason to get home a dog is getting a new companion. Whether it is to go jogging in the morning or someone who will care to listen to your woes of a tiring day at the office, your dog will forever be game for everything that you want. If you have children in the house, getting home a  pet dog  will teach them responsibility and instill in a sense of sharing and caring for another living being. In this fast paced world where is all that makes sense, such sensitivity is a blessing.     Dogs that are adopted from certified dog adoption centers usually have been vaccinated prior to being given for adoption. Not only this, the center also offers free vaccination for recurring doses. Many of these dogs are pure  dog breeds  or belong to a pedigree variety. This however, does not mean that a pariah dog is an untouchable. In fact, pariah dogs are lot more resistant to illnesses and are very social when compared to pure breeds. Never reject a dog based on pedigree alone. By adopting a dog, you could be saving a life. There are roughly around a million dogs that are put to sleep every year due to over crowding and over population in adoption centers. Even adoption centers have an upper limit.      There are many websites that publish information on  dog adoption . Here, you can skim through the pages of classifieds on our website to have a look at the kind of dogs that are being put up for adoption. Adopting a dog like a child also involves some legality. If the  dog adoption  center is a certified one, then you will have to sign a few documents and the center officials may make visits to your place after the adoption to ensure if the dog is being taken care of well. There is a time limit within which a dog must be adopted. If the adoption does not happen, the dog may be put to sleep. Make the decision today and save a dog life.

One more  word to the wise...                                While reputable shelters and adoption organizations attempt to pre-screen their animals, rescue/adoption requires additional diligence  because some dogs may have  serious behavioral problems that aren't evident at first glance; in particular                               aggression. If this proves to be the case, be prepared to do the work necessary                               to make the dog manageable; consult with a trainer before coming out to the park. See our rescue section for more  tips on rescue .

When she was taken to the Brooklyn ACC shelter back in August, 2008. She was saved by a rescuer and taken to her boarding facility in Long Island where she's been ever since. But she needs her forever home asap! She is a lovely 1 1/2 year old staffy mix, full of love and energy, hugs and kisses. She loves people, most other dogs if they don't bother her too much, and now after months of waiting, she desperately needs her own home!She's already spayed, chipped, vaccinated and truly READY TO GO! If you can give this lovely girl her first real chance at happiness, please email  MKLMLKWK@aol.com                                            01/11/09                     Big Jack Needs Home...                      Jack was rescued from the Animal Care and Control shelter this November. On his behavior test, he showed no aggression and did very well on his SAFER. He is a little ""pushy"" around other dogs, but not aggressive.                                            Jack is incredibly attractive, and thought to have Redbone Coonhound in his genetics. (maybe with some Ridgeback or Lab?) He is a large well muscled dog that weighs in around 80 pounds. The hound part of Jack is dominant and therefore he will need an active, involved owner. And of course, he needs lots of exercise! If you are a runner and want a partner, or a outdoors person that craves company, this is you guy! Jack would also make a great agility dog as Coonhounds are intelligent and love a challenge. These are real working dogs, not couch potatoes. At a year and a half Jack is still a young dog. He needs a calm assertive guardian to set rules, boundaries and limitations . He is a bit puppyish and these dogs are known to mature slowly emotionally.                                            Due to his size and puppy like behavior we would like to place him in a home with older children and no cats. It would be perfect if he is the only dog but we can also do a meet and great with other dogs. Jack is currently being boarded upstate; a visit can be arranged for those without a car. If you're interested in this incredible specimen, please email  MKLMLKWK@aol.com                       01/06/09                     Adopt Red Hook Beauty....                     Her name is Honey and she was abandoned on our doorstep 8 weeks ago. She was curled up and terrified but we lured her into our basement with food. We have been caring for her ever since. She has blossomed into a super sweet, super intelligent and obedient dog. She is a Staffordshire bull terrier, about a year old, about 35lbs and 17"" tall at the shoulder. She is full grown. She has been to the vet and has her shots, is microchipped and is spayed. She is HW negative.                                           Honey loves to play in the snow, play tag, fetch and tug of war. She knows how to sit and stay and is learning how to drop it and lay down. She is very easy to train because she is so smart and will do pretty much anything for a treat. She is house trained using a crate and walks well on a leash. She is very responsive and wants to please. She can be shy of some strangers but will warm up after she knows that they are friends. Honey can be picky about which other dogs she gets along with so she would do really well in a household with no other pets. Older children are OK. She has a good energy and doesn't go overboard but she is very strong and can knock a small child down.                     We love her and would keep her if we didn't have cats! We want to find her a great home with someone who has experience with the bully breeds or a willingness to learn about what makes these breeds so special.                     There is an application and adoption fee of $150 to be donated to the Red Hook Dog Rescue, who is helping us with her medical and other needs.                     Thank you!

Be sure to purchase the Dolce Vita Combo Heating and Cooling Dog Bed and find out what all the fuss is about.                 The Dolce Vita Heating and Cooling combo dog bed provides comfort and promotes good health for pets.  Hot weather or strenuous activity can leave a pet exhausted and overheated.  Normally pets seek the cooling effects of laying on hard tile or concrete surfaces which can stress bones and muscles. The Dolce Vita heated and cooling dog bed delivers cool air therapy through a unique, patent-pending air channel cushion and provides your pet with the comfort of a cool therapeutic surface to sleep and relax.  Low-level heat therapy has been proven scientifically to promote health and improve activity level of pets and can aid in providing relief from arthritis and sore joints and muscles. Additionally, the comforting effects of heat can stimulate circulation, reduce anxiety, and help pets maintain their natural body temperature.  The Dolce Vita heating and cooling combo dog bed delivers heated air therapy through the cushion which helps pets remain pain free and active.  The DuoTemp provides year-round comfort to pets of all ages.   Cool, Hot, In One Package    Dolce Vita is the first and only brand to provide a bed with both heating and cooling. Your pet will love you for it.    Cool Air Therapy    Pets get overheated, too. Now they can cool off in style. The Dolce Vita heating and cooling combo dog bed provides cool air when pets are stressed from exposure to a warm environment or strenuous activity.    Therapeutic Air Heat    Low-level warmth provides relief for sore joints and muscles, stimulates circulation and can help reduce anxiety.    Therapeutic Foam Padding    Provides balanced support to ease joint pain and reduce bone and muscle stress.    Luxurious Microsuede Cover    The cover is water, scratch and stain resistant and can be easily removed and machine-washed.    Pet Safe Design    The Dolce Vita Combo Heating and Cooling Dog Bed is designed with pet safety in mind. The bed functions on a safe, low power electrical system. The pad is slip resistant and the even-temp design eliminates hot or cold spots through uniform distribution of air flow.             Pictured to the right is the easy-to-use controls for the Dolce Vita heating and cooling dog bed.  With the flip of a switch, the temperature can be changed from hot and cold and back again.     The Dolce Vita hating and cooling combo dog bed uses advanced technology to warm or cool your pet, as necessary.

BYE-BYE BABY   No more lonely cold nights or hearing that I'm bad, No more growling belly from the meals I never had. No more scorching sunshine with a water bowl that's dry. No more complaining neighbors about the noise when I cry. No more hearing ""shut up"", ""get down"" or ""get out of here""! No more feeling disliked, only peace is in the air. Euthanasia is a blessing, though some still can't see why I was ever born if I weren't meant to be. My last day of living was the best I ever had. Someone held me very close, I could see she was very sad. I kissed the lady's face, and she hugged me as she cried. I wagged my tail to thank her, then I closed my eyes and died.

As many of us know, summer can be the best time of year for our pets: lazy afternoons outside, swimming, and lots of sun. But all of the splendors of summer come at a cost. Our pets must endure the heat, bugs and allergies that come with the months that encompass May through August of each year.      Since the heat of the summer is right around the corner, there are some things that will help make your companion more comfortable. Some of these things are simply common knowledge, but it's easy to forget that pets have a different physiology than we do and often have a more difficult time in the heat than humans would.      First and foremost, don't leave your dog in a locked car for any period of time. When it is hot it only takes minutes to reach dangerous temperatures inside the car. Dogs can't sweat the same way as humans can. They thermo-regulate mostly by panting and can sweat minimally through the bottom of their feet.      Heat stroke is a very serious life-threatening disease that can afflict dogs quite rapidly. dark-colored dogs are particularly prone to heat stroke due to the fact that their dark coat absorbs heat. Other medical factors that predispose your dog to heat stroke are obesity, laryngeal paralysis and heart disease. Some common early signs of heat stroke include panting, excessive salivation, hyper-excitement and increased rectal temperature. Heat stroke can affect every organ in the body; if you suspect that this is taking place, seek immediate veterinary attention for your pet.      Never leave your dog tied in a place where it can?t find shade or access to water. This seems very commonsense, but sometimes dogs left on chains or leads may wind themselves around a tree and cut off their access to water.      We all know that summer means bugs, and bugs are pests for humans and canines alike. Fleas are a common pest that thrive in moist, humid climates. Fleas live off the blood from their hosts and can cause itching from the bite itself or simply from crawling around under your pet's coat.  Flea bites can also cause an allergic reaction, called flea-bite dermatitis, in certain animals resulting in severe reactions such as intense itching, crusty skin and hair loss. Fleas can also be carriers for other parasites, such as tapeworms. Dogs that itch will groom themselves and ingest fleas, providing a direct route for tapeworms to develop in the intestines of your pet.       Mosquitoes, another pest of the summer, can carry larvae called  Dirofilaria immitus , or heartworms, that can lodge in your dog's pulmonary artery and cause serious health problems. Preventatives for fleas and heartworms are available in many different varieties and can be purchased from your veterinarian.  Heartworm pills and flea preventative are relatively inexpensive and far outweigh the nuisance and health hazards triggered by a flea or heartworm infestation.      Many people clip or shave their dogs in the summer time with the logic that less hair will allow for a cooler canine. However, Dr. Karen Campbell, a veterinary dermatologist at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Urbana, Ill., explains that clipping your dog may be counterproductive. The canine coat is designed to hold heat near the body in the winter, but also to insulate against the heat from the sun in the summer. Leaving your dog's hair coat intact will actually provide a cool microenvironment for your pet. Your pet's fur also helps act as a sunscreen to protect its skin from ultraviolet radiation. Yes, dogs can get sunburn as well.      Dr. Campbell does concede that a dark-colored dog will get a lot hotter in the summer due to his color (dark colors absorb more heat energy from the sun). If you do own a dark-colored dog it may be beneficial to clip it despite the loss of the insulating properties of their hair coat.       One thing is for certain, dogs that are outside in the summer heat should be properly groomed. Dr. Campbell reminds us that a matted coat will trap moisture on the skin providing an excellent environment for skin infections or even worse problems.      Allergies are a problem for humans and dogs alike.  Allergic reactions may develop on your dog to various  causes. One type of these reactions is called ""hot spots."" They look like red, round spots that tend to have a slightly slimy appearance. While hot spots are an issue that certainly require a veterinarian's care, Dr. Campbell recommends the temporary use of tea bags applied directly to these hot spots until a veterinary appointment can be made. ""The tanic acid in the tea bags may help to relieve some of the irritation,"" she says.      While the heat of summer can be oppressive to dogs there are some simple things like water, shade, flea and heartworm prevention, grooming and allergy care that can help make it more bearable. After all, our pets want to enjoy the summer as much as we do.      For more information about summer care for your pet, consult your local veterinarian.

How does your adoption process work?                            A.           PLEASE take   a few moments to read the following explanation of our adoption policies and the   steps that make up the process.  You may be surprised to find that adopting an   animal is a more involved process than you expected, or that it means you can’t   have immediate access to an animal you are interested in.                Therefore, it’s important to understand two   things:   1) the process is the same for every-one, and   2) it’s not our intent to   frustrate you.     Rather, everything we do is for the best interests of the animals   in our care, and is aimed at giving them the best possible chance of finding   a permanent home   Our   website is not meant to be viewed as a catalog.  Yes, you may like the   look of a particular dog, but that does not necessarily mean that the dog's   personality is a match for your family or lifestyle. Our adoption success rate   is quite high and we are quite proud of our program and its standards. This is   because our main concern is finding happy endings for the dogs in our   program.             HERE   ARE THE STEPS YOU’LL GO THROUGH IN THE ADOPTION   PROCESS:          Before   you can adopt any animal, we ask you to complete an  adoption application .     Our   process includes asking questions, asking to see proof of identity and,   frequently, asking for veterinary references, particularly when you have other   animals at home. This is simply to protect the health of adoption candidates and   the pets you already have.       Once   all the paperwork has been submitted   it will be reviewed by one of our volunteers.    We will contact you to clarify any questions we may have and assist in setting up an appointment at a volunteer’s home or be invited to an adoption event where a   knowledgeable   member of our volunteer staff will be available to questions about behavior, training,   veterinary care, how to deal with introductions to current pets, and anything   else you can think of.    You   will be asked to sign an adoption contract and  pay an adoption fee . This fee   covers spaying or neutering, veterinary care, deworming, vaccines,   food, and other items   your pet has received while   in our care.    PLEASE   NOTE :  We cannot hold animals for anyone. Unfortunately, because of the   tremendous demands on our foster   homes,   all adoptions must be done on a first-come, first-served basis,   and the first good, properly-qualified prospective home will get the pet   LET US REPEAT:  We don’t ever mean to be frustrating to or evasive with you. We want you to    understand that it’s stressful and upsetting-in fact, downright devastating - for the animals, for our volunteers,    and most importantly, for you when adoptions don’t work out and pets have to come back to    us. And a bad adoption experience can sour some people on shelter animals — for life.                       So try to bear    with us and be patient. Understand that going through the process the way we do really is the best    policy-for all of us.                                                                   Q.           I sent in my application a few days ago and have not heard back yet when can I expect an email?                           A.           In most cases you will get an email with in a day.           If you have spam blocking on your e-mail account this would           usually be the problem as we find that our mail sometimes            gets lost there. You could try shutting it off and sending in a            new application.                                                                   Q.           I see a dog on your website that I want to adopt, how can I             meet it?                           A.           The first step is to fill in an adoption application so that a            volunteer can work with you directly to set up an appointment.                                                                   Q.           Can't I just talk to someone before filling in an application?                           A.           PawSafe's Volunteers have made a commitment to ensure           that the animals we place will be in their new home for life.            This is why we ask that applicants complete an application            form prior to speaking with an adoption coordinator.                                                                    Q.           I am just in love with a certain puppy on your website.  Will you place him/her on hold for me?                           A.           Please plan on meeting the animal you are interested in            adopting. Although the pictures and descriptions may show            the ""perfect"" pet for you - nothing replaces an actual            meeting!! You can NOT place an animal on hold. This is unfair            to both the animal and other potential adopters.                                                                   Q.           Where can I go to meet all the dogs at one time?                           A.           PawSafe is run via a network of volunteers who take animals            into their own homes in addition to holding adoption events at the  Danbury CT Agriventures Agway  and Holiday Tyme Pet Hotel in Patterson NY. There is no central location            for you to meet all the animals at once. Adoptions and            surrenders are by appointment only.                                                                   Q.           How long does it take from when I submit my application to being able to adopt.                           A.           That depends.  We are a small group of volunteers and try            our best to respond in with a day - if not hours!  The more            information you take the time to give us in your adoption            application, the faster we can approve you for adoption.            Normally the process is completed within 24 hours to several            days at most!                                                                   Q.           What is your adoption fee for Puppies / Dogs?  And what does it include?                           A.           Our adoption fee of $400 includes:               Health examination(s)                 Spaying/Neutering  **                30 days of FREE Pet Health Insurance                Wormings (age related)                 Distemper Combo Vaccination (number of vaccinations will be related to age)                 Rabies Vaccination (If older than 4 months when adopted)                 Heartworm Disease Test (If older than 6 months when adopted)                 Flea & Tick Treatment                 In addition, most (not all) of our animals are microchipped and we provide FREE   registation through 24 Hour Pet Watch                                  ** unless too small/young/or deemed unsafe for the puppy at this time.              All vaccinations and future exams after adoption become the responsibility of adoptive family.              The adoption fee is payable in cash, check or credit card . Please be   aware that our credit card company will charge us $13.80 for this transaction   and that amount will be added to your adoption fee  .  There is a   $35 dollar charge for bounced checks                                                                   Q.           What forms of payment can you accept?                           A.           The adoption fee is payable in cash, check or credit card .                         Please be   aware that our credit card company will charge us $13.80 for this transaction   and that amount will be added to your adoption fee  .                          There is a   $35 dollar charge for bounced checks                                                                               Q.           I am coming to meet a dog that you have for adoption.  If I             like he/she will you hold it for a few days while I get supplies             or go on vacation?                           A.           Adopters should be prepared to take their new puppy home            at the time of adoption!! We are a small rescue. We CANNOT            hold your dog for you while you go on vacation or prepare            the house for your new family member. This should be done            before you come to adopt a dog. Please understand, if we did             that, we would save far less dogs because of a lack of space             or resources. Thank You                                                                   Q.           I have already filled in an application and been approved - now I see a dog I want to meet.  How can I set that up?                           A.           Just send an email to  adoptions@pawsafe.org                                                                                                                                                 "

The Miniature measures 15 inches or less at the    shoulder, making the breed more suitable for Poodle-lovers living in the    city. The coat colors, conformation and general care of the Miniature    are identical to those of the           Toy Poodle . Easy    to train and full of fun, these bright, affectionate dogs make wonderful    playmates for children and all-round excellent family companions.                                                       Back to    Miniature Poodle Puppy Central Menu                                                                                   Puppy Central Home     Page  -               Miniature Poodle Puppy Central Menu  -               Miniature Poodle Breed Profile                Miniature Poodle Puppy  Breeders                                                                                                                               Click Link  to View Current          Miniature Poodle Puppy Classified Ads                                                                               Featured Miniature Poodle    Puppy Breeders                                                                                                                                                                                        Ash's Mystical Poodles                     Marie Hedeman                    Las Vegas, Nevada                    Ph: (702) 263-7988                            Email  |                      Full Page Ad                                                                             Ships World Wide                                                                                                                                                                             Kimron Miniature Poodles              Sharon Lanphear              La Center, WA              Tel: 360-263-3710                    Email  |               Full Page Ad                                                         Ships Within the USA and     Canada                                                                                                                                                                                 Crabapple Downs            Arlene Mills            Colebrook, NH             Ph: (603) 237-4385                     Email  |  Web Site                                             Ships Within the USA                                                                                                                                                                 Moonstone Miniature     Poodles            Kimberly Koopman Keizer, Oregon Ph: 503-463-7207                             Email  |             Full Page Ad                                             Ships Within the USA and     Canada                                                                                                                                                                               Your Miniature Poodle Kennel Here                    From Just $49.95 Per Year!

We are dedicated to finding good homes and matching White Shepherds and White German Shepherds in need with loving people that will love their dog as part of their family.  Our mission is to place homeless dogs into loving and permanent homes, to educate the public about the breed, promote responsible pet care, and to provide ongoing training support and advice to adopters after our dogs have been placed in their new homes.  Echo Dogs White Shepherd Rescue is a foster home based organization. We do not operate a shelter. The temperment and behavior of each dog is carefully evaluated while they are in foster care so that we can match each dog with a home best suited to meet their particular needs.  Dogs are also taught good house manners,  given basic obedience skills, and socialized while in foster care.        How we started                     Mark Echterling had been involved in many things with his white shepherds, Max and Shadow, including Search and Rescue,  Dog Scouts of America (DSA) ,  American White Shepherd Association (AWSA) , and was always there with his talented dogs to help raise funds for needy organizations.              In late 1999 Mark founded Echo Dogs White Shepherd Rescue. The organization began in Cedar Lake, Indiana with about 5 people.   Today EDWSR is nationwide, including Canada, and is growing more every day. Mark lost his year and a half long battle with lung cancer and passed away in September, 2004. He will always be remembered for his hard work with white shepherds. He will be sadly missed.       Take care of our babies who are at Rainbow Bridge Mark, we love you!         - EDWSR Volunteers                                    br>                                    Copyright © 2007 Echo Dogs White Shepherd Rescue, Inc.                         Terms of use  -  Privacy Policy                                 
clueweb09-enwp00-96-06746	"                     Greyhound adoption          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 A Greyhound       Greyhound adoption  or  Greyhound rescue  programs focus on helping  Greyhounds  move from  racing  - where in some countries they live in  kennels  on the  track  - to homes.           Contents       1   Background   2   Origins of the Greyhound adoption movement   3   Care by adoption groups     3.1   Medical care   3.2   Living conditions   3.3   Behavior of adopted greyhounds       4   References   5   See also   6   External links               [ edit ]   Background   Many Greyhounds are adopted as  pets  after they retire from racing. A few pups are adopted directly into homes, most often due to injury at a young age. Others are  euthanized  due to injury, or age, causing them to be no longer profitable to their owners (often at 3 to 5 years old). Greyhounds can live to over 12 years of age if given proper medical care.   Currently, most Greyhound adoption programs are based in the  United Kingdom ,  Canada ,  Australia ,  New Zealand  and the  United States . In  Europe  groups deal with dogs from a variety of sources; for example, in  Spain , ex-hunting dogs are often in need of rescuing along with Greyhounds.     [ edit ]   Origins of the Greyhound adoption movement   The Greyhound adoption movement grew out of a concern by a few individuals about the treatment of the dogs while racing.   Greyhound Pets of America (GPA) was established in 1987 for the purpose of finding homes for ex-racing greyhounds, and educating the public on the suitability and availability of greyhounds as pets. GPA is the largest non-profit greyhound adoption group. [ citation needed ]  Since its creation GPA has adopted out over 65,000 greyhounds. [ citation needed ]   In 1989 David Wolf founded the National Greyhound Adoption Program (NGAP) mostly with his own resources. He has become the most controversial figure in the greyhound adoption community, and is one of the most outspoken critics of the greyhound racing industry. [ citation needed ]   The Greyhound Project maintains a directory of hundreds of greyhound adoption agencies throughout the world.   Over time as the number of adoption groups has grown, a deep ideological division regarding  Greyhound racing  has developed. Some groups are generally opposed to any form of Greyhound racing for any purpose. Others are officially racing neutral, meaning they neither oppose nor endorse dog racing. Many race tracks and racing dog owners support Greyhound adoption. [ citation needed ]   When Greyhound adoption first started in the United States, many people associated with racing argued that Greyhounds did not make suitable pets. However Greyhounds are gentle and affectionate dogs who adapt easily to household life, making excellent companions.     [ edit ]   Care by adoption groups     [ edit ]   Medical care   Typically when a group or individual picks up a Greyhound from the racetrack they need a significant amount of basic medical care:     Dental cleaning   Treatment for  worms  or other  parasites   Spaying and neutering   Vaccinations  such as rabies   Ear cleaning to remove dirt from the tracks   Clipping nails   Treatment of existing injuries       [ edit ]   Living conditions   Greyhounds living with adoption groups generally receive one of two types of care: kennels or foster homes. Several adoption groups use kennels, which are similar to those used by the tracks in the United States. These kennels generally allow larger spaces for each dog than provided at the tracks; the dogs also receive much more time in outdoor runs. Other groups feel that the best way to prepare the dogs for living in homes is to provide them with a home to live in. These groups place the dog in a volunteer foster home. The adoption group generally pays for the  medical  care and food for the dogs in their care, while allowing the foster ""family"" to train the dog and provide for its day-to-day needs.   There is some debate within the adoption community about which technique is better. The trade off is essentially quality of living situation vs. number of animals helped. It is generally accepted that by having kennels, the group can help a larger number of dogs more effectively, while groups that have a foster program can provide a better living situation for the dog more quickly. Some groups who use kennels also cite the hardship on the dog in becoming attached to a foster family and then being moved to their permanent homes.     [ edit ]   Behavior of adopted greyhounds          A blue female greyhound relaxing       Like any dog, greyhounds vary widely in their temperament, behavior, levels of activity, and in virtually all other aspects of their personality. As they are accustomed to a particular regimented environment at the track, they may adapt to life in a human home slowly, gradually overcoming fears of new sounds and experiences. Greyhounds may not immediately understand windows and glass doors, attempting to move through them, and may require an introduction to staircases and slippery floor surfaces. [ citation needed ]  Trainability varies, as with any breed, but many are highly food or toy motivated and therefore very trainable. [ citation needed ]   Although usually well-socialized with other greyhounds, ex-racers often fear other dog breeds until sufficiently exposed. As the  lure  used to train greyhounds for racing resembles a  rabbit , retired racers might mistake smaller dogs for a lure, causing them to set chase. Similarly, small animals including  cats  may also be the subject of prey-driven behavior by some greyhounds. Prior to adoption, agencies generally screen greyhounds for their suitability around small animals. [ citation needed ]          Greyhound and cat       Greyhounds have a strong prey drive, having been bred to hunt and chase, which is often difficult or impossible to overcome through training. [ citation needed ]  Frequently, Greyhound adoption agencies require owners to keep them on-leash at all times, except in fully enclosed areas. [ 1 ]   Greyhounds have very thin skin, and can be easily harmed by biting or scratching from other dogs. Combined with their low body fat, coats or sweaters are required when outside in cold weather.   At home, greyhounds may consider the house to be an extension of their crate, which they will usually not voluntarily urinate or defecate in. As a result,  housebreaking  may be surprisingly easy. As with all breeds, there are exceptions, and some greyhounds may be particularly difficult to housebreak. [ citation needed ]   Greyhounds enjoy resting on beds and sofas, often sleeping or dozing 16 hours a day or more. Particularly common is the so-called ""roaching"" or ""cockroaching"" sleeping position, where the Greyhound will roll onto his/her back and spread his/her legs at odd angles in all directions. This term originates from the fact that the position is similar to that of deceased cockroaches which are often found on their backs.   Greyhound adopter events are found wherever ex-racers are re-homed. Some are small local gatherings hosted by adoption groups; others are regional events drawing participants (dog and human) from great distances. The largest of these events is known as  Greyhounds Reach the Beach , [ 2 ]  which takes place in  Dewey Beach ,  Delaware  in the  United States . Two to four thousand dogs and their human escorts generally attend this event.     [ edit ]   References     ^  While some owners disagree or ignore this advice, adoption groups like those linked here are generally very clear about this requirement.

How can I ride without them?                                            I thought horses needed shoes if you wanted to ride them. Am I being cruel if I ride my horse without shoes on?                                                       My shod horse stumbles all the time, even when I not riding him! Won he be even more dangerous without shoes on?                                                       My horse feet chip and fall apart without shoes. Won he get worse if I keep him unshod?                                                       What is the transition period people talk about? Does it mean I won be able to ride my horse for a while if I take his shoes off and go arefoot                                                       What is the difference between natural hoof care and an ordinary farrier trim?                                                       I keep my horse shod because he has really flat feet. Can natural hoof care help his flat soles?                                                       I read that a lot of research went into developing the natural hoof care method of trimming and most of the information was obtained from wild, free-roaming horses in the USA. Aren those mustang horses different from our horses? How can a wild horse in America be compared to our domesticated horses in New Zealand ?                                                       Won my horse have less grip/traction without shoes and slip more easily?                                                       My shod horse has always been sensitive to stones. If I take his shoes off and find a trimmer or farrier to trim him how long will it be before he will be able to be ridden on gravel roads?                                                         I do a lot of competing and jumping on my shod horse. I use studs for grip in heavy going. Wouldn my horse slip too much if his feet were bare ?                                                       My horse shoes keep falling off. He has weak, thin, shelly walls and his shoes usually only stay on for a week. I can possibly take his shoes off because he doesn have any hoof wall. He not a good candidate for natural hoof care is he!?                                                       What is conditioning? I hear people talk about conditioning their horse feet and I curious to know what this entails.                                                       I sometimes ride on tar seal and gravel roads. Don horses need horse shoes on their hooves to protect them from the stones and abrasive footing?                                                       I have read that horse hooves bleed after being trimmed! I not comfortable about someone making my horse bleed!! Is this necessary?                                                       My horse hooves keep splitting. Can natural hoof care prevent this?                                                       If I riding long distances, i.e. Trekking or Endurance, won my horses feet wear down too much without shoes on?                                                       I usually only get my horses trimmed every 3 months or so, about when the hoof wall starts to split and break off. How often would I have to trim my horses if I followed this method?                                                       I tried taking the shoes off my horse but found barefoot didn work for her. Even after 2 months she wasn able to trot comfortably on a gravel road. Why didn it work for her?                                                       Ie tried everything with my foundered pony. Can natural hoof care cure her? She is very sick.                                                       My horse used to be very athletic but now he seems to be getting very lazy when I ride him. Ie recently read that this can be because he has pain somewhere in his body. Could his feet be sore?                                                       I have a shod horse that always has cool hooves. Ie been told this is normal but my unshod pony always has warm hooves. Is this because horses and ponies are different or is there something wrong with my pony?                                                       My horse constantly seems to shift his weight from one leg to another while resting. My friend said that natural hoof care can help him with this. Why does he do it and can the trimming you describe help him?                                                       What benefits or changes would I expect to notice if I took the shoes off my horse?                                                       Would I be able to do a really big ride like the Great New Zealand Horse Trek or the South Island Cavalcade if my horse was barefoot?                                                         Is there anyone in my area who has changed to natural hoof care that I can contact to hear what they have to say about this method of trimming horse hooves?                                                       My friend said that her horse used to be grumpy but he has become really sweet natured after a couple of months of natural hoof care. Surely it isn just trimming his hooves that has changed his nature!?

A few pups are adopted directly into homes, most often due to injury at a young age. Others are  euthanized  due to injury, or age, causing them to be no longer profitable to their owners (often at 3 to 5 years old). Greyhounds can live to over 12 years of age if given proper medical care.   Currently, most Greyhound adoption programs are based in the  United Kingdom ,  Canada ,  Australia ,  New Zealand  and the  United States . In  Europe  groups deal with dogs from a variety of sources; for example, in  Spain , ex-hunting dogs are often in need of rescuing along with Greyhounds.     [ edit ]   Origins of the Greyhound adoption movement   The Greyhound adoption movement grew out of a concern by a few individuals about the treatment of the dogs while racing.   Greyhound Pets of America (GPA) was established in 1987 for the purpose of finding homes for ex-racing greyhounds, and educating the public on the suitability and availability of greyhounds as pets. GPA is the largest non-profit greyhound adoption group. [ citation needed ]  Since its creation GPA has adopted out over 65,000 greyhounds. [ citation needed ]   In 1989 David Wolf founded the National Greyhound Adoption Program (NGAP) mostly with his own resources. He has become the most controversial figure in the greyhound adoption community, and is one of the most outspoken critics of the greyhound racing industry. [ citation needed ]   The Greyhound Project maintains a directory of hundreds of greyhound adoption agencies throughout the world.   Over time as the number of adoption groups has grown, a deep ideological division regarding  Greyhound racing  has developed. Some groups are generally opposed to any form of Greyhound racing for any purpose. Others are officially racing neutral, meaning they neither oppose nor endorse dog racing. Many race tracks and racing dog owners support Greyhound adoption. [ citation needed ]   When Greyhound adoption first started in the United States, many people associated with racing argued that Greyhounds did not make suitable pets. However Greyhounds are gentle and affectionate dogs who adapt easily to household life, making excellent companions.     [ edit ]   Care by adoption groups     [ edit ]   Medical care   Typically when a group or individual picks up a Greyhound from the racetrack they need a significant amount of basic medical care:     Dental cleaning   Treatment for  worms  or other  parasites   Spaying and neutering   Vaccinations  such as rabies   Ear cleaning to remove dirt from the tracks   Clipping nails   Treatment of existing injuries       [ edit ]   Living conditions   Greyhounds living with adoption groups generally receive one of two types of care: kennels or foster homes. Several adoption groups use kennels, which are similar to those used by the tracks in the United States. These kennels generally allow larger spaces for each dog than provided at the tracks; the dogs also receive much more time in outdoor runs. Other groups feel that the best way to prepare the dogs for living in homes is to provide them with a home to live in. These groups place the dog in a volunteer foster home. The adoption group generally pays for the  medical  care and food for the dogs in their care, while allowing the foster ""family"" to train the dog and provide for its day-to-day needs.   There is some debate within the adoption community about which technique is better. The trade off is essentially quality of living situation vs. number of animals helped. It is generally accepted that by having kennels, the group can help a larger number of dogs more effectively, while groups that have a foster program can provide a better living situation for the dog more quickly. Some groups who use kennels also cite the hardship on the dog in becoming attached to a foster family and then being moved to their permanent homes.     [ edit ]   Behavior of adopted greyhounds          A blue female greyhound relaxing       Like any dog, greyhounds vary widely in their temperament, behavior, levels of activity, and in virtually all other aspects of their personality. As they are accustomed to a particular regimented environment at the track, they may adapt to life in a human home slowly, gradually overcoming fears of new sounds and experiences. Greyhounds may not immediately understand windows and glass doors, attempting to move through them, and may require an introduction to staircases and slippery floor surfaces. [ citation needed ]  Trainability varies, as with any breed, but many are highly food or toy motivated and therefore very trainable. [ citation needed ]   Although usually well-socialized with other greyhounds, ex-racers often fear other dog breeds until sufficiently exposed. As the  lure  used to train greyhounds for racing resembles a  rabbit , retired racers might mistake smaller dogs for a lure, causing them to set chase. Similarly, small animals including  cats  may also be the subject of prey-driven behavior by some greyhounds. Prior to adoption, agencies generally screen greyhounds for their suitability around small animals. [ citation needed ]          Greyhound and cat       Greyhounds have a strong prey drive, having been bred to hunt and chase, which is often difficult or impossible to overcome through training. [ citation needed ]  Frequently, Greyhound adoption agencies require owners to keep them on-leash at all times, except in fully enclosed areas. [ 1 ]   Greyhounds have very thin skin, and can be easily harmed by biting or scratching from other dogs. Combined with their low body fat, coats or sweaters are required when outside in cold weather.   At home, greyhounds may consider the house to be an extension of their crate, which they will usually not voluntarily urinate or defecate in. As a result,  housebreaking  may be surprisingly easy. As with all breeds, there are exceptions, and some greyhounds may be particularly difficult to housebreak. [ citation needed ]   Greyhounds enjoy resting on beds and sofas, often sleeping or dozing 16 hours a day or more. Particularly common is the so-called ""roaching"" or ""cockroaching"" sleeping position, where the Greyhound will roll onto his/her back and spread his/her legs at odd angles in all directions. This term originates from the fact that the position is similar to that of deceased cockroaches which are often found on their backs.   Greyhound adopter events are found wherever ex-racers are re-homed. Some are small local gatherings hosted by adoption groups; others are regional events drawing participants (dog and human) from great distances. The largest of these events is known as  Greyhounds Reach the Beach , [ 2 ]  which takes place in  Dewey Beach ,  Delaware  in the  United States . Two to four thousand dogs and their human escorts generally attend this event.

The  Rat Terrier  is an  American   dog breed  with a rich and varied background as an all-around farm dog. Traditionally more of a type than a  breed  they share much ancestry with the tough little mixed breed dogs known as ' feists .' Several private associations have maintained Rat Terriers registries for some decades, but more recently there have been movements to obtain breed recognition by the major canine organizations. Common throughout America on  family farms  in the 1920s and 30s, they are generally considered a rare breed [ 1 ] . Today's Rat Terrier is a handsome, intelligent, active little dog that is equally cherished as a farm helper and as a family pet.

The ""classic"" base is black tanpoint with  piebald  spotting (known as ""black tricolor""), but blue and brown tricolors are also common, along with red, sable, lemon, and other colors set off by varying amounts of white spotting. Ticking is usually visible in the white parts of the coat, or in the underlying skin.  Brindle , currently disallowed by the main breed standards, is considered by some to be a ""traditional"" Rat Terrier pattern, and there is a growing movement to have this pattern accepted into the breed. However,  merle  is widely considered to be the result of recent outcrosses and, because of associated health problems, is rejected by most Rat Terrier breeders. [1]  Ear carriage can be erect, tipped, or button, all of which contribute to an intelligent, alert expression. The tail has been traditionally  docked  to about 23 inches, but the  bobtail  gene is very common in Rat Terriers and can result in a variety of tail lengths. Today, some breeders prefer a natural, undocked tail, which is accepted in the breed standards.   In the 1970s, a hairless mutation appeared in a single Rat Terrier bitch, and was propagated into a strain of the Rat Terrier. After a period of development by crossing to coated dogs, the  United Kennel Club  (UKC) recognized the  American Hairless Terrier  as a separate breed in 2004.          Rat Terriers usually have natural erect ears and an alert expression.       The Rat Terrier ranges from about 10 to 25 pounds and stands 13 to 18 inches at the shoulder. The miniature size (13 inches and under as defined by the UKC) is becoming increasingly popular as a house pet and companion dog. A larger strain, often in excess of 25 pounds, has been developed. These  Deckers  or  Decker Giants  were named after a  breeder  named Milton Decker to create a larger hunting companion and are recognized by the National Rat Terrier Association (NRTA, see Breed recognition below). The NRTA recognizes a Toy Variety weighing 10 pounds or less, and continues to classify the  Teddy Roosevelt Terrier  as the Type B Rat Terrier. In any event the Toy and Miniature Rat Terriers display the same hardiness, prey drive, and stamina as their Standard sized counterparts.     [ edit ]   Temperament   Although often mistaken for a  Jack Russell Terrier , the Rat Terrier has a different profile and a very different temperament. Rat Terriers are finer of bone and have a more refined head. They always have a short single coat, i.e. they are never wire coated. Rat Terriers tend to be less aggressive than Jack Russells; while they have a definite terrier personality they also have an ""off switch"" and love lounging on the sofa in a lap as much as tearing about the yard. Rat Terriers are normally cheerful dogs but they tend to be more sensitive and at times calmer than Jack Russells to changes in their environment, owner's moods, or to unexpected noises, people, and activities. The ""social sensitivity"" of Rat Terriers makes them very trainable and easier to live with for the average pet owner but it also means that extensive socialization from an early age is critical. Proper socialization of a rat terrier puppy includes exposing the animal to a wide variety of people and places, particularly during the first 3 months of life. Like most active and intelligent breeds, Rat Terriers tend to be happier when they receive a great deal of mental stimulation and exercise.     [ edit ]   Health Problems   Some lines carry some genetic problems. The breed is particularly known for having  allergies , whether they be contact allergies, inhalant allergies, flea allergies, or food allergies. Rat Terrier owners should avoid conditioning/bluing the fur as it often leads to a rash and itchiness in this breed. Dog perfume is also not recommended. Rat Terriers can also develop  hip dysplasia  or  elbow dysplasia  and  luxating patellas , and in severe cases will require expensive surgery to correct. Another problem is  malocclusions  and bite problems. Some lines are also at increased risk of developing  demodectic mange , an abnormal sensitivity to normal mites in the dog's skin that is believed to have a genetic basis. They have also been known to develop  seizures  and can gain weight fast.     [ edit ]   History   The breed name comes from the occupation of its earliest ancestors; brought to the US by working class British migrants, these quick, tough little dogs gained their fame in rat pit gambling. However they were, for the most part, bred for speed. Their speed is used for controlling vermin and hunting squirrels, hare, and other small game. Like all terriers of this type, Rat Terriers most likely developed from crosses among the extinct  English White Terrier ,  Manchester Terriers ,  Smooth Fox Terriers , and  Whippets . After the 1890s, as the breed type became popular in America, other breeds were added to the mix.  Beagle ,  Italian Greyhounds ,  Miniature Pinschers , and  Chihuahuas  were likely used to add scenting ability, speed, and smaller size. Many of the foundation Rat Terriers were indistinguishable from small mixed-breed hunting dogs known as "" feists ."" The smaller varieties were split off from the Rat Terrier very early on, registered by the UKC as the Toy Fox Terrier beginning in 1936.   Rat Terriers were cherished as loyal and efficient killers of vermin on 20th century American Farms, as well as excellent hunting companions. As a result they were one of the most popular dog types from the 1920s to the 1940s. However the widespread use of chemical pesticides and the growth of commercial farming led to a sharp decline in the breed from the 1950s onwards. Fortunately breed loyalists maintained the bloodline, leading to the modern Rat Terrier we enjoy today.   The genetic diversity of the Rat Terrier is undoubtedly its greatest asset, and is responsible for the overall health, keen intelligence, and soundness of the breed. Most modern breeds were developed from a few founding dogs and then propagated from a closed gene pool. In contrast, the Rat Terrier has benefited from a long history of refinement with regular outcrosses to bring in useful qualities and genetic variability.     [ edit ]   Breed recognition   Rat Terrier organizations exhibit the typical disputes over the course of action to be taken for the promotion and preservation of the breed. As usual among  working breeds , points of departure are which dog type best represents the breed and whether the dog's working qualities will be sacrificed to selection for  conformation show  competition. Perhaps because the Rat Terrier has existed for decades with several evident types upheld by different clubs, disagreements can be highly charged. It seems safe to say however that even farm-bred Rat Terriers have been cherished as much for their smart, amusing, and trainable companion qualities as for their skills at eradicating rats and hunting small game. Thus it is not surprising to see increasing numbers of Rat Terriers excelling at performance sports such as agility, rally, and obedience.          Five week old Rat Terrier       The National Rat Terrier Association is the largest independent registry and has maintained lineage records for decades. Feeling the working terrier nature of the breed will suffer, it is the most prominent of those clubs and associations opposed to Kennel Club closed-registry breeding rules.   The UKC officially recognized the breed on  January 1 ,  1999 . The Rat Terrier Club of America is actively working towards recognition by the  American Kennel Club  and the breed was accepted into the AKC's Foundation Stock Service in 2005. The first Rat Terrier to earn a title under AKC Sanctioning was in Agility on  January 14 ,  2006  in  Van Nuys, California .     [ edit ]   Miscellaneous   The  RCA  trademark dog,  Nipper  (""His Master's Voice"") might have been a Rat Terrier or a  smooth fox terrier .   U.S. President  Theodore Roosevelt  owned a small, dark colored dog that became well known for eradicating rats from the White House, and some have claimed the dog as a Rat Terrier. A short-legged version of the Rat Terrier (a.k.a. the Type-B Rat Terrier) was recognized in 1999 by the UKC as a separate breed, named the  Teddy Roosevelt Terrier  since the former President's dogs were supposedly of the short-leg variety.   The Rat Terrier was a common farm dog in the early 1900s, bred for catching barn rats in haystacks. Purportedly a rat terrier holds the record for most rats killed in a single infested barn: 2501 rats in 7 hours.   Eleanor Powell trained a little dog named Buttons for a tap dance scene in ""Lady Be Good""  [2]  A Rat Terrier was mentioned in Harper Lee's  To Kill a Mockingbird  published in 1960. Sean Connery attends a rat baiting match in the 1978 movie 'The Great Train Robbery' which features a Rat Terrier.       [ edit ]   References       ^   Kummer 2006 .

( NASDAQ :  PETM ) is a retail chain doing business in the  United States  and  Canada  engaged in the sale of specialty pet supplies and services such as  grooming  and  dog training , PetSmart PetsHotel dog and cat boarding facilities and Doggie Day Care. The name PetSmart was coined as a  pun , since its name serves both as Pet Smart and Pets' Mart.

PetSmart was founded in  1986  and opened its first Pet Food Warehouse stores in the Phoenix area. Through several mergers and acquisitions, PetSmart expanded in the early- and late-1990s across the U.S. and into Canada, and entered online retailing through a partnership with  Idealab  in  1999 .   In early 2000, PetSmart remodeled most of its store in a plan they called ""Eagle"" which changed many of its stores from a front-half storefront, back-half warehouse feel to an all-over standard retail market, in hopes of not intimidating customers.   In August  2005 , the company announced that it was rebranding its name from PETsMART to PetSmart. This move is designed to emphasize its evolution from a pet supply store to a solutions-oriented company. [ 1 ]   As of November 2007, PetSmart operated approximately 1,000 stores and about 150 locations with PetsHotels and Doggie Day Camps. Some PetSmarts are co-located with  Banfield Pet Hospital  veterinary offices.     [ edit ]   Product lines     [ edit ]   Dog products   PetSmart owns several brands that produce a variety of products. Great Choice, previously Award (although the Award name still appears as a selection of canned wet dog food), is a grocery line of dog food which PetSmart owns. Authority is a bridge dog food that PetSmart distributes. PetSmart also owns Bargain Hound, which produces crates and dog beds. Grreat Choice and Authority also produce lines of dog treats in a range of treat sizes and flavors. Groomax, grooming tools for both dogs and cats, including brushes, combs, nail trimmers, shampoos and, conditioners is a PetSmart private brand as well.     [ edit ]   Cat products   PetSmart also owns several brands that produce cat products. Like dog food, PetSmart has a line of Authority cat food, available in canned and dry varieties. Similarly, Authority is considered a premium food. A second, lower price brand, Sophisticat, is PetSmart's grocery cat food, which is also available in dry and wet varieties. Unlike PetSmart's dog food brands, Grreat Choice (previously Award) is not distributed for cats. PetSmart also produces cat litter, under the name Exquisicat, as well as most litter related products. Toy Shoppe, which produces dog toys, also has a variety of cat toys.     [ edit ]   Bird, fish and small animal products   PetSmart produces fish tanks, stands, and aquarium decorations under the Top Fin name. Top Fin also makes gravel, filters, heaters and other accessories, including starter kits that include several basic components. The former PetSmart label for store brand fish supplies was Proquatics. Bird products are created under the Top Wing label, and includes most items needed for birds, including cages, bowls, perches, and other products. PetSmart also has a small animal brand, named All Living Things.   In January, 2008, PetSmart voluntarily stopped selling live birds at all of its 785 stores in the US after the discovery of  psittacosis  in some cockatiels in their stores in December 2007. Psittacosis is an infection caused by a strain of bacteria closely related to chlamydia that can be transmitted from birds to humans and produces symptoms similar to the flu. [ 2 ] PetSmart has now started selling live birds again as of about April, 2008.     [ edit ]   Horse products   Formerly, certain PetSmart stores included a  State Line Tack  section. It provided a wide selection of saddles, halters, bridles, saddle pads etc. State Line Tack also sold feed and other equipment for the care of horses.   In 2007, PetSmart put State Line Tack, including all catalog and internet business, up for sale and effectively removed all State Line Tack merchandise from stores. State Line Tack was eventually purchased by Horse.com, one of many websites owned by  Pets United . [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Charities and adoption centers   PetSmart has helped stray pets find homes with families. Rather than selling dogs, cats, rabbits and other larger animals in the store, PetSmart donates space to local rescue groups. Rescue groups are also provided with donations of food, litter and other supplies. Fees from adoptions are collected by the groups themselves. With each adoption, PetSmart gives the new guardians a book which provides basic care information for their new pet. As of August 22, 2007 over 3,000,000 pets have been adopted through Petsmart adoption centers. Bi-annually, PetSmart hosts an adoption weekend featuring more adoptable pets than at other times.   PetSmart Charities, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, also raises money for local adoption groups, including groups that it does not offer in-store space. In many stores, donations are collected at the register via traditional drop boxes. Some stores also ask customers if they wish to donate a dollar at the register when they use a credit or debit card. PetSmart charities also has an annual donation drive. Proceeds from Petsmart Charities events are given to over 3,400 adoption partners. PetSmart Charities claims that of the six to eight million pets collected by rescue agencies, three to four million are euthanized simply because they do not have a loving home.   PetSmart Charities Inc. is set to award the Austin Humane Society the first of three grant installments totaling $227,000 to assist in funding AHS's new Feral Cat Spay/Neuter Program. [ 4 ]   PetSmart Charities is also known for its Rescue Waggin' program. The program operates specially-designed trucks that transport adoptable dogs from areas that are overpopulated to partner shelters where adoptable animals are in demand. Rescue Waggin' operates trucks in the Midwest and the Northeast regions of the United States. The program has saved more than 10,000 pets since 2004.     [ edit ]   Allegations by PETA   PetSmart has been the subject of public criticism by animal rights organization  PETA  for the company's sale of live birds. PETA alleges that it is cruel to sell birds bred in warehouses and feels that the breeding of the birds is similar to the use of  puppy mills . PETA renewed its demands that PetSmart permanently stop selling live birds after the voluntary halt in bird sales because of the  psittacosis  outbreak in January 2008. [ 5 ]  PETA also claims that the use of pest control glue traps within PetSmart stores is cruel. PETA feels that because the stores sell various species of  rodents , that it is hypocritical for them to engage in rodent pest control. PetSmart counters that it is unfair to characterize its bird breeders as similar to puppy mills since these operations must meet the company's veterinarian established and industry leading standards for the breeding, care and transportation of these pets. Also, small pets sold in the stores are bred to be pets and should not be confused with wild rodents, which carry disease and are destructive to property. It maintains that essentially all major retailers, restaurants and grocers with rodent control programs effectively use glue traps, even though many chains including Rite Aid and CVS have stopped selling glue traps. [ 6 ]   On January 23, 2008, PETA posted a press release accusing one of Petsmart's largest vendors,  Rainbow World Exotics , of neglect and cruelty to animals. [ 7 ]  Videotape evidence provided by an undercover PETA member who infiltrated the facility as an employee shows small animals treated cruelly and neglected. The more serious allegations included laypersons (not vets) neutering animals with unsafe provisions, live animals thrown in the trash, loose animals killed intentionally, and sick animals killed or left to die with no veterinarian interaction attempted. After these allegations PetSmart launched an investigation, which included dispatching a team of PetSmart veterinarians and other staff to Rainbow's facility unannounced. They reported that their investigation found no serious wrongdoing by Rainbow and claim that the video the PETA member took was inaccurate and did not represent the entire situation. PetSmart further allege that the PETA representative who recorded the images failed to raise any concerns of abuse or mistreatment to managers of the facility during her two-month employment  [ 8 ] . PETA is filing complaints with the  USDA  and pursuing criminal charges with the county of Hamilton, where Rainbow World exotics is located.

clueweb09-en0011-41-17207	"  Breaking    Traditions:    A Veterinary    Medical and Ethical Perspective On the Modern Day Usage of Steel Horseshoes       by Tomas G. Teskey,    D.V.M. Hereford, AZ, U.S.A.    tomasteskey @ yahoo.com (delete spaces)   Twenty-three centuries ago, in  The    Art of Horsemanship , Xenophon stated, ""The same care which is given to the    horse's food and exercise, to make his body grow strong, should also be devoted    to keeping his feet in condition."" This is as true today as it was thousands    of years ago.    The horse is a symbol of beauty    and strength:    Man has relied on horses for their    strength and speed for the past few thousand years. These cycles of life have    continued on, and we are part of those cycles along with the horses that continue    to accompany us. Ownership of horses today is still a necessity for some, but    is becoming more and more a luxury and a privilege. As our relationship with    horses evolves, many modern-day horse owners are becoming more thoughtful, sensitive    and caring toward their horses; they are coming to understand that they are    not merely owners of livestock, but stewards of these fine animals who serve    us so well as companions in our sports and recreation. Those who have come to    see themselves as stewards of their horses have become sensitive and responsive    to all of their horse's needs. They realize they are personally responsible    and obligated to provide what is best for their horses, even though doing so    involves challenging many common, traditional horsekeeping practices--changes    are being made that better respect the nature of the horses we hold so dear.       Becoming students of the hoof--where    we have been and where we are going:    We responsible horse stewards are    taking a new interest in our horse's feet. As a veterinarian studying the    equine hoof for the past few years, I have found that most veterinarians, farriers,    and trainers do not know what a normal horse's foot looks like, nor do    these professionals have a full understanding of how a normal horse's hoof    functions. From pictures in veterinary references to diagrams in farrier texts,    the equine foot is represented as a structure devoid of it's most beautiful    and functional characteristics. The prevalence of hoof deformities in the general    horse population is so common that they are looked upon and thought to be ""normal""--the    picture of a narrow, upright hoof, complete with a steel shoe, has permeated    our modern culture so deeply that it will take decades and generations to fully    expose it as the deformity and cruelty it represents and replace it with an    image of a full, round, unrestricted hoof that symbolizes the horses' strength,    health and vitality . Listening to and depending on veterinarians, farriers,    and trainers to tell you what is right and healthy for your horses shows you    respect these professionals, but because most of them are not experts regarding    horse's hooves, it is critical that you are at least able to recognize    what a normal hoof looks like and know a deformed one when you see it. Only    after you educate yourself in these matters can you have an intelligent conversation    with professionals and make an informed decision regarding their recommendations.       ""Do not believe in anything simply    because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken    and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written    in books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers    and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down    for many generations. But after observation and analysis, when you find that    anything agrees with reason and it is conducive to the good and benefit of one    and all, then accept it and live up to it."" ~  Buddha   Numerous textbooks, a large number    of essays, an increasing number of dissertations and an enormous quantity of    clinical evidence supports the position that  when steel contacts a horse's    foot, damage occurs . As many of us all ready know, most farriers freely    admit that the best possible scenario is to have a horse barefoot. Many experienced    farriers encourage their clients to keep their horses barefoot for at least    part of the year, and many farriers keep their own horses barefoot. Rather than    studying and perfecting ways to  ensure  that the horses fully benefit    from what is all ready understood to be ""the best"" situation, shoeing is spoken    of as ""a necessary evil"". What we now know to be true is that shoeing is  only    an evil  and  never   necessary  once one studies and becomes familiar    with the amazing anatomy and fascinating physiology of the hoof. I  know     that to apply steel to a horse is extremely damaging, and what follows is a    synopsis of just a few of the harmful effects of nailing steel on to hooves:       We have been looking at our horses'    deformed feet for long enough.    The problem actually begins before    a steel shoe even touches the horse's hoof. The preparation of a hoof for the    application of a steel shoe is extremely damaging in itself. The natural, life-promoting,    energetic shapes of the natural hoof are disrespected and disregarded when a    farrier flattens the solar aspect of the hoof for the application of a shoe.    The horse's foot evolved as a conical structure, with a set of domes and sets    of triangles collected together in a final architechture that is one of the    stongest,  dynamic  shapes in the universe. Flattening the bottom of the    equine hoof demonstrably destroys it's ability to efficiently perform all of    it's functions, and the subsequent nailing of a rigid steel ring around its    lower edges ensures a steady and treacherous progression towards  dis-ease     in the entire horse. Continuing this shoeing procedure perpetuates a state of    physiologic stagnation and predictably leads to hoof deformation. For man's    application of steel to the body of the horse, this resultant stagnation and    deformation leads to disease, lameness, premature loss of use, painful debilitation    and eventual early death in well over half of all domesticated horses in the    industrial world today.    Steel meets skin:    Nails driven through the hoof walls    allow all manner of bacteria, fungus and filth to enter the foot; the once efficient,    natural physical barrier to these invaders is breached when the hoof wall is    pierced. The conductability of the nails and steel shoe allow concussive forces,    vibrations and sudden, extreme changes of temperature to enter the hoof. Multiple    holes in the walls of the hoof, especially over successive applications, lead    to direct structural breakdown of the hoof walls by causing cracks, breaks,    and by physically leveraging the hoof wall away from deeper hoof structures.    Sometimes when a steel shoe is pulled off by a horse, the edges of the hoof    wall go with it.    The damage caused by decreased shock    absorption within the shod foot is well documented--the horse's hoof is designed    to handle most of the shock absorption required for traveling over any terrain;    this is accomplished only if the hoof capsule is allowed to expand upon contact    with the earth, passing concussive forces to the cartilages which surround the    more sensitive soft tissues inside the foot. When steel is fixed to the hoof    capsule, the hoof can not adequately expand and the built-in shock absorbing    structures within the hoof can not do their job. Ground forces that once were    directed backward and upward are now primarily directed upward, following a    vector determined by the presence of the nails, leveraging the hoof wall away    from the coffin bone. This is exactly like lifting on the end of your fingernail    and tearing it off the nail bed at the tip of your finger. Every horse that    is shod will have some amount of laminar separation--it is a physiologic certainty.    Whether grossly visible or microscopically, every shod foot has separation.    This situation sets a horse up quite well for chronic laminitis, or often an    acute founder situation after overeating or becoming sick. The sole is held    in a vaulted position in a shod hoof, no longer allowed to flatten slightly    with footfall, and is now forced to receive a beating from the coffin bone above.    All of the joints, cartilages and ligaments higher in the horse's leg, extending    further up and in to the back and entire body, must now take up the task of    dissipating concussive forces, a job these structures never evolved, nor are    designed, to handle. The result is extra wear and tear which produces measurable    damage to these areas. Truly, much of many horses' back soreness and leg    lameness are directly due to damage from having to withstand concussive forces    that they were not designed for--all because the natural shock absorbing function    of the hooves has been compromised by the application of steel shoes.    So, let's reduce concussion to    keep our horses from this damage...?    Pads fitted to the hoof between    sole and steel shoe do not appreciably increase the shock-absorbing function    of the hoof, as the hoof is still being clamped together, disallowing hoof mechanism.    In actuality, the damage continues to occur, and even a slight increase of pressure    on the soles of the hoof through pad material forces the sole up against the    immobilized, unyielding solar corium within the hoof, causing bruising and reducing    blood flow in these areas. The sole often responds with a ""dysplastic"" kind    of growth. This is an abnormal growth pattern that is thicker but not as strong    or durable as normal sole that forms when a horse is allowed natural hoof form    in a more natural environment. Farriers often misinterpret this abnormal growth    as ""healing"" and a good thickening of sole, when in fact it signals the early    stages of hoof deterioration.    We get used to seeing abnormalities,    not wanting to believe there is damage.    This faulty growth does not impress    or alarm most farriers because they are accustomed to seeing abnormal and deformed    shod hooves and improperly trimmed bare hooves. They work with them every day,    and though there are likely many farriers, veterinarians and other professionals    that are aware of the differences, many more are  unaware  of what these    changes signify. Thus, when a farrier claims that ""none of my clients' shod    horses have any problems"", they are actually telling the truth. However, once    educated in proper hoof form and function, every farrier I've ever enlightened    has looked back and been able to point out exactly where many of the deformities    exist in a shod hoof.    The use of pads also increases the    presence of moisture next to the horse's soles, providing a breeding ground    for hoof-rotting bacteria and fungi that soften the soles into a cheesy consistency    devoid of durability. Pads also prevent normal respiration and perspiration    that occurs in bare frogs and soles, impairing the horse's ability to regulate    his body temperature and excrete waste proteins through exfoliation.    What amount of concussion is     just right ...?    There is an important and misunderstood    role that concussion plays in providing life-giving stimulation to the foot.    The natural hoof has concussion-absorbing properties appropriate for each horse    on its home terrain...it's that simple. When we apply artificial materials and/or    conditions to horse's hooves, such as steel shoes, pads, plastic ""repairs"",    soft footing in riding arenas, and bedding in stalls, our interference reduces    concussion to a level below what is appropriate, preventing the vital stimulation    needed for the production of durable hoof tissues, healthy cartilage and ligaments    and strong bones. Without concussive stimulation to the hoof, the horse's    hooves and legs grow weaker and weaker. When owners attempt to ""protect"" their    horse's hooves with artificial appliances and inappropriate conditions,    they are actually promoting weak and faulty growth and nurturing conditions    for disease.    ""My horse just can't go barefoot...""         Some owners believe their particular    horse, or perhaps some breeds of horses, are intolerant of being barefoot. No    doubt, these people have had experiences with horses that get sore feet or whose    feet deteriorate whenever they are allowed to go barefoot. What is likely the    case here is that these owners are seeing horses whose feet are weak, chip easily,    are always bruised and lame because they have a history of having been shod,    improperly trimmed for a long time, or disallowed adequate movement on appropriate    terrain from the day they were born. It isn't being barefoot that these    horses are intolerant of--rather it is an intolerance to being shod, improperly    trimmed and/or inappropriately managed. The further claim that the ""horses have    had the hooves bred right off of them"" is also an excuse that certain ones need    steel shoes to do their ""jobs""...in actuality, it is the mismanagement of horses    from the moment of their birth, and even before birth, that sentences them to    a life of mediocre hoof and leg quality.    Creating more problems in the    whole horse...    One of the greatest damages that    occurs because of the application of steel shoes to the horse's hoof is    the greatly reduced circulation within the hoof, and the diminished return of    blood back up toward the heart through the veins of the lower leg. Shoes interfere    with the hoof's natural blood-pumping mechanism. The natural hoof expands    and contracts with each step, letting blood in as it spreads upon impact with    the ground, and squeezing blood up and out of the hoof as it contracts when    it is not bearing weight. If this sounds familiar, like the blood pumping mechanism    of a heart, that's because it is--natural hooves perform a critical function    as supplementary ""hearts"". This vital heart-like mechanism is greatly restricted    by immobilizing the hoof with steel shoes.    I have read that the horses hoof    ""pumps much more blood than it needs to perform it's functions"", thus the amount    of lost circulation due to nailing a steel shoe on it is of no consequence.    Now, what kind of retarded excuse is this that justifies the use of the steel    shoe? Why was a hoof designed over such a monumental amount of time--to assist    circulation to the degree it does, so that man would be able to nail a rim of    steel to it? Such a presumption is an example of the ignorance that is so prevalent    and been allowed to flourish around horses for the last thousand years. In the    long run, the reduced circulation in the foot and leg of the horse through the    application of steel shoes harms the horse's entire body. The damage adds up    over time, taxing the body with its attempts to heal, and gradually stressing    it beyond it capacity to mend. Not just the feet are taxed, but all the organs    and all metabolic processes. Damaged cells and tissues are able to heal only    so many times, divide so many times, and put up with insults so many times.    Animals die when cells and the organs they make up are no longer able to divide    and repair damage. Debilitating pain and premature death of horses is the result    when we fail to trim hooves properly and/or nail on shoes.    We create problems for our horses    when we ignore the natural design and functions of their feet. Our arrogance    in believing we can improve on nature causes them great harm. What we as stewards    must accept, and try to get others to realize, is that horses' feet have    great strength and durability and perform optimally when proper, bare hoof form    exists and when they are kept in the most natural lifestyle possible.    Seeking out the information and    getting help...    Numerous published books have straight    forward instructions on proper hoof trimming techniques and guidelines, and    there are additional sources on the internet. There are programs for training    owners, and re-training farriers in the natural way of trimming hooves if they    are willing to go the distance and pay the price, but even with the support    and guidance of all available sources, turning around everyone's attitudes    toward shoeing, and changing how we provide good stewardship for our horses    to provide what they really need (including lifestyles and diets), is going    to be a real challenge and take some concerted effort by all of us who care    for our horses. My original mentor on the subject, Martha Olivo, has herself    evolved over the last few years, developing an easily understandable format    with which to approach the horse's hoof and trim it successfully. She has developed    United Horsemanship, an organization that lends itself as the solidarity vehicle    for the barefoot movement worldwide. We are ""horsemen helping horsemen become    better horsemen.""    A veterinarian such as me easily    understands how the presence of a steel appliance on the bottom of a horse brings    harm. When other veterinarians, other equine professionals, and stewards come    to discover the true workings of the horses' hooves they will cease to perpetrate    such harm, and will not stand idly by while others do so. When they better understand    how the horses' feet are constructed, function, grow, offer protection    and allow proper and vital sensation for the horse to interact with their environment,    these good people will have gained a very powerful new tool. They will no longer    ignorantly resort to or demand the use of a nailed on appliance or a confined    lifestyle for horses. They will stop unknowingly causing pain and premature    deaths for the horses they care about.    I understand this now, and I    can no longer keep it to myself, for I took  The Veterinarian's Oath  oath    nine years ago:    Being admitted to the profession    of veterinary medicine, I solemnly swear to use my scientific knowledge and    skills for the benefit of society through the protection of animal health, the    relief of animal suffering, the conservation of livestock resources, the promotion    of public health, and the advancement of medical knowledge.    I will practice my profession conscientiously,    with dignity, and in keeping with the principles of veterinary medical ethics.       I accept as a lifelong obligation    the continual improvement of my professional knowledge and competence.    (Adopted by the American Veterinary    Medical Association House of Delegates, July, l969)   A word (or more) about integrity    and strength of conviction:    To begin, this is just ""facts of    life"" kind of stuff, and here's a fact that you can count on: I will not ever    ask you to consider shoeing your horse with steel. I have conviction in my belief    about this and it is unwavering. If I was to cheat by saying, ""Well, this time    I guess...OK, go ahead and nail shoes on"", or, ""Gee, I guess this horse can't    do it...."" I would be compromising my very keen sense of integrity. I do not    sit on the fence or beat around the bush on this issue. Steel shoes cause harm    to horses, and I simply can't abide that. Some folks can advocate both shoeing    and going barefoot, but I cannot. I have read and understood the Veterinary    Oath.    Some additional thoughts and    feelings:      Many folks aren't eager or accustomed    to expressing their views about what they've learned to be true, let alone professing    them in a way that shows absolute conviction, so it's no wonder that some of    these same folks find it distasteful or rude or egotistical when someone else    proclaims that they are possessors of the truth. Some folks will suggest that,    ""we should all just try to get along"", or ""you're entitled to your opinion,    and you should respect mine"", or ""it's a big tent, room for everybody!"",    or even, ""we'll just agree to disagree"".    Once in awhile, you'll run    across somebody with absolute conviction and rock-solid integrity, practicing    what he believes in, because those beliefs are what keep him strong. Such a    person may be unpopular, disliked, and even ridiculed, because he is likely    to call attention to those who are wavering, misinformed or don't quite    have the knowledge or understand the information presented. I know this happens,    from experience, and it's often due to such adverse reactions from others that    a person with strong convictions about a new way of thinking and a different    way of doing who is willing to speak out and try to convince others is more    and more a rarity in our world.    I'm keenly aware of how I impress    some people as a ""know-it-all"", or seem to be ""it's my way or no way"" sort    of guy, but that's not true. I do disdain shoeing horses, and that is a practice    near and dear to a lot of people. I call into question the things they've spent    their entire lives working on. Naturally, they're likely to have an initial,    negative reaction, but often, when I get the opportunity to go beyond the initial    reaction and enter into an in-depth exchange with these same men and women,    I encourage them, sometimes rather forcefully, to examine their beliefs and    their practices based on them. It can be a painful process. I've had friends    and other people who have put shoes on horses for decades who break down and    sob when the truth of what they have been doing hits them. This is real and    it is powerful. I know: I was on the receiving end of the same process not too    long ago. I am extremely grateful to have come in to this knowledge of the horse's    hoof.    Being a farrier is hard work. I    shod at least a few horses of my own every few weeks during my younger years,    so I can relate to the pain and strain that comes with the tasks and the skills    it requires: the careful attention to detail, the ability to work well with    your hands, working around a naturally shy but powerful animal and a caring    attitude. But when ""the rubber meets the road"", no matter how hard you've studied    to learn how to shoe a horse, no matter how hard and demanding the work is,    no matter how much money you've spent getting that education, no matter how    traditional the practice is, none of these things, and nothing beyond these    things makes shoeing a horse the right thing to do. When something is wrong,    it's wrong. Steel hurts horse's feet, period.    Gradually more farriers are realizing    that we have better options. Some already encourage people to let their horses    go barefoot ""as much as possible"", but they and the owners are still not fully    convinced or educated and they go along with the conventional wisdom that horses    need shoes nailed to their feet for ""protection"" or ""support"" when they are    participating in activities like jumping and dressage, competitive trail rides,    and other demanding sports or use. But we now  know  that any kind of shoe    nailed to a hoof damages that hoof. Every time, all of the time, one-hundred    percent of the time, every minute that steel contacts a horse's foot, damage    is being done. Steel shoes do not protect hooves, and hooves certainly don't    need ""support"", even if there was some way to get it from shoes, which there    isn't. In fact,  the more extreme of a horse sport you participate in, the    more important it is for your horse to have natural, hard-working, properly-functioning    feet...think about it.    Reaching our destinations with    our horses...our partners...    So in spite of the resistance meet,    I am dedicated to help with the ""wake up call"". I feel that farriers and veterinarians    and trainers and horse people everywhere must learn the truth and tell their    clients, friends, and colleagues that shoeing horses damages them and robs them    of years of their lives. I want everyone to know that steel on a horse's hoof    is not acceptable. It is the horses that especially want and need this knowledge    to become mainstream.    I particularly want farriers to    learn the truth and then be held accountable for the damage they cause if they    fail to inform their clients that shoeing is not necessary. They need to learn    what is going on inside the horse's foot and learn how to trim a foot to achieve    a healthy hoof form. They need to help educate horse owners who relay on them    for guidance about how to help their horses become healthier and more serviceable    for a longer time, through better hoof care. They need to know about and talk-up    the judicious use of hoof boots so owners know they have a way to provide real    hoof protection without damaging their horses' feet. Farriers are important    professionals in the equine world and horses and stewards count on them.    Farriers are in the ideal position    to learn about proper, natural hoof form and function: they have the clientele    with horses, the love for the horses and they know how to use hoof trimming    tools. What more is needed is the willingness and the dedication to study more    thoroughly and apply more carefully the natural hoof trim, and learn to counsel    their clients on more natural means of horse care and management-getting horses    out of stalls, feeding them fewer rich foods and more grass in their diet, and    letting horses be together in herds where they naturally belong. For a farrier,    retiring the anvil and hanging up the hammer leads to being part of an inevitable    change for the better and championing a noble cause, and they can rest assured    that what they will be doing is founded on solid knowledge gained from careful    study of the biology and physiology of the horse.    Farriers, if you let people know    that you are dedicated to the welfare of the horse, you will reap great rewards.    The monetary rewards will still be there, in fact they'll probably be even    better, and with less strenuous work; good people everywhere will be more than    happy and willing to pay for proper trimming and guidance in keeping their horses    healthy, and if you become knowledgeable and practiced enough, you will be able    to save the lives of many laminitic horses others ailing from hoof problems    that would not be able to heal if they were treated only with conventional methods,    such as so-called ""therapeutic"" shoeing. Money aside, the personal rewards are    terrific.    ""Barefoot-friendly"" veterinarians    are a rare breed, too; more are very badly needed. As of now, in a huge percentage    of equine veterinary schools and clinics the world over, the highly effective    therapy of natural lifestyle and the natural barefoot trim are not even mentioned    as treatment options for lame and foundered horses. This is highly unacceptable    and is a disservice to the horses we love. It is an omission that serves the    egos of those who use horses as tools, rather than as the companion animals    that serve us so willingly.    As time goes by, veterinarians and    other equine professionals will be unable to ignore the mountain of clinical    and scientific data related to the harm done by the use of the horse shoe, and    the astounding benefits of natural lifestyle and natural hoof form. A few all    ready accept this, and yet there are those that can not help but prescribe driving    nails in to the hands of horses even after being told that what they are doing    is causing damage. Whether from ignorant stubbornness or an addiction to working    with steel or whatever the reasons, they will be held accountable if they continue    once this knowledge becomes more widespread.    There will be more and more veterinarians    picking up on this and the horses of the world are going to be healthier, happier,    and more serviceable than ever. We will look at the horses in the future and    see them as the magnificent specimens of power that they are. Seeing one with    steel plates nailed to its feet will draw criticism from those that know better    and who respect and love the horse.    A professional plea.    Veterinarians...my colleagues: recommending    shoes for a horse before you became aware of the overwhelming evidence against    such a practice is forgivable, but if you continue that practice once you've    been alerted to its dangers and understand the concepts, you're courting    contempt. As recently as three years ago, I was prescribing eggbar shoes, pads,    impression material and other bizarre procedures--I can't do that anymore. I    deeply regret that many horses died at my hands because I didn't know what to    do to save them. Now when I see horses with similar conditions, I can treat    them without prescribing shoes, indeed often without anything more complicated    than proper trimming of their hooves, movement, and diet. Most of these horses    are better in a short time. Better yet, by keeping clients' horses out of shoes    all together as they mature, the typical, super-prevalent hoof problems will    largely be a thing of the past. I encourage all veterinarians to become students    of the hoof and experience the huge degree of personal satisfaction that is    attained by saving that ""hopeless"" case, and see the relief in the eyes of owners    when they realize they'll never have to shoe their horses again--the gratitude    and admiration I continue to receive from these folks begins a journey from    ownership to stewardship.    I implore all veterinarians to learn    about the much better ways we have of truly protecting horses' feet with alternatives    to steel shoes--the natural trim based upon the rediscovered and continually-improving    understanding of the workings of the equine foot, and a myriad of different    hoof boot designs with more coming all the time. Boots allow a horse's    feet to have vital mechanism with every step, and can completely protect the    feet. It's really hard for me to even fathom using a steel shoe at all because    these devices are simply not offering anything beneficial to a horse...only    harm. We can't continue to apply them and feel good about it.    This is a plea to equine professionals    everywhere. People around the world are beginning to grasp some very fundamental    concepts of horse care and the care of their feet, and they will need your help    in implementing what they want for their horses. Some are doing it themselves    in their own back yards, taking hoof knives in hand and saving their own horses,    out of a desperation born from an inability to garner professional help. It    is up to you to look at the available data, evaluate it critically, relate it    to the anatomy and physiology of the horse and apply it to the horses in your    care. By doing so you will become an integral part of improving the health and    welfare of horses everywhere. The fact is that truth and knowledge are destined    to win out, in spite of weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.    ""All truth passes through three    stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is    accepted as being self-evident."" ~  Arthur Schopenhauer   Coming into the knowledge of the    horse's hoof is a powerful thing. I encourage those who have acquired this knowledge    to use it, but to tread lightly! Speak with conviction, but maintain an open    ear to the concerns of others. Listen as they express their insecurities and    ignorance concerning the use of steel shoes; remember, that is all they have    ever known. Be honest about the time and effort it will take to undo the harm    shoes have caused. Learning how to enlighten and influence those that have a    difficult time seeing and/or admitting what it is best for the horse is our    goal.    I am continuing to learn every day    as I listen to people and their concerns. I'm learning what is best to say and    how best to say it. Sometimes, I don't know the whole answer, and it's    actually helpful when that happens, because it forces me to learn more, dig    deeper, and consult with others who know more than I do. It has never caused    an erosion of the base of truth concerning the horse's hoof, rather, it allows    me to further strengthen that base for my convictions.    The power of truth.    The nature of the horse tells us    what we need to know about the horse. The truth speaks for itself without me    having to sell you anything tangible. This is the hallmark of dealing with the    truth. It's difficult confronting the mainstream and trying to turn the    tide, but once you become enlightened, a powerful energy will be yours to embrace:    the power of the truth; the power to heal; the power of the horse!

Abnormally high body temperature (also called hyperthermia) develops after increased muscular activity with impaired ability to give off heat due to high heat and humidity or respiratory obstruction. Allowing a dog to remain in a car with closed windows on a hot summer day is probably the most common cause of heat stroke. Normal dogs dissipate heat from their skin. In addition, panting allows evaporation of water from the respiratory tract and is an effective method of heat dissipation. When these mechanisms are overwhelmed, hyperthermia and heat stroke usually develop. The elevation in body temperature stimulates the body to release substances that activate inflammation.                                              At temperatures greater than 109 Fahrenheit, failure of vital organs, and consequently death, can occur. Heat-related illnesses, including heat stroke, heat exhaustion and heat cramps can occur after exposure to extremely high environmental temperatures. These illnesses occur in all mammals and can be prevented by taking proper precautions.

clueweb09-enwp00-74-00093	"                     Dog anatomy          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Dog anatomy  includes the same internal structures that are present in all canids. Details of structures vary tremendously from  breed  to breed, more than in any other animal species, wild or domesticated, [ 1 ]  as dogs vary from the tiny  Chihuahua  to the giant  Irish Wolfhound .          External anatomy (topography) of a typical dog: 1.Stop 2.Muzzle 3.Dewlap (throat, neck skin) 4.Shoulder 5.Elbow 6.Forefeet 7.Croup 8.Leg (thigh and hip) 9.Hock 10.Hind feet 11.

The dog's ancestral skeleton provided the ability to run and leap. Their legs are designed to propel them forward rapidly, leaping as necessary, to chase and overcome prey. Consequently, they have small, tight feet, walking on their toes; their rear legs are fairly rigid and sturdy; the front legs are loose and flexible, with only muscle attaching them to the torso.   Although selective breeding has changed the appearance of many breeds, all dogs retain the basic ingredients from their distant ancestors. Dogs have disconnected shoulder bones (lacking the collar bone of the human skeleton) that allow a greater stride length for running and leaping. They walk on four toes, front and back, and have vestigial  dewclaws  (dog thumbs) on their front legs and sometimes on their rear legs. In some cases, these claws are missing due to surgery, the rear dewclaws sometimes being removed to prevent the possibility of their being ripped off, or catching on something and breaking, especially in dogs with loose dewclaws. This practice is illegal in some countries.   The dog's ancestor was about the size of a  Dingo , and its skeleton took about 10 months to mature. Today's  toy  breeds have skeletons that mature in only a few months, while giant breeds such as the  Mastiffs  take 16 to 18 months for the skeleton to mature.  Dwarfism  has affected the proportions of some breeds' skeletons, as in the  Basset Hound .   Knowledge of basic anatomy also helps when competing in dog shows or contests.     [ edit ]   Size   Researchers have identified a particular piece of  genetic material  that is common to every  small-dog breed  and, in turn, is probably responsible for making them tiny. The study, published in 2007, found a  regulatory sequence  (not a gene) next to the gene  IGF1 ; together the gene and regulatory sequence together are known as a  haplotype  that ""is a major contributor to body size in all small dogs."" Medium and large size dogs do not usually have the regulatory sequence, although the small-size sequence was found in the  Rottweiler  breed. The study included 3,241 dogs from 143 breeds. The researchers concluded the genetic instructions to make dogs small must be at least 12,000 years old, and it is not found in wolves. [ 2 ]  Another study has shown that  lap dogs  (small dogs) are among the oldest  dog types . [ 3 ]   Modern  dog breeds  show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Within the range of extremes, dogs generally share attributes with their wild ancestors, the  wolves . Dogs are  predators  and  scavengers , possessing sharp teeth and strong jaws for attacking, holding, and tearing their food. Although selective breeding has changed the appearance of many breeds, all dogs retain basic traits from their distant ancestors. Like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wristbones, a  cardiovascular  system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.     [ edit ]   Sight          A  Greyhound , one of many breeds of  sighthound       Like most mammals, dogs are  dichromats  and have color vision equivalent to red-green  color blindness  in humans. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  Different breeds of dogs have different eye shapes and dimensions, and they also have different  retina  configurations. [ 7 ]  Dogs with long noses have a "" visual streak "" which runs across the width of the retina and gives them a very wide field of excellent vision, while those with short noses have an "" area centralis ""  a central patch with up to three times the density of nerve endings as the  visual streak   giving them detailed sight much more like a human's.   Some breeds, particularly the  sighthounds , have a field of vision up to 270 (compared to 180 for humans), although broad-headed breeds with short noses have a much narrower field of vision, as low as 180. [ 4 ] [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Hearing   According to hypertextbook.com, the frequency range of dog hearing is approximately 40 Hz to 60,000 Hz. [ 8 ]  Dogs detect sounds as low as the 16 to 20  Hz  frequency range (compared to 20 to 70 Hz for humans) and above 45 kHz [ 9 ]  (compared to 13 to 20 kHz for humans), [ 8 ] [ 5 ]  and in addition have a degree of ear mobility that helps them to rapidly pinpoint the exact location of a sound. [ 10 ]  Eighteen or more muscles can tilt, rotate and raise or lower a dog's ear. Additionally, a dog can identify a sound's location much faster than a human can, as well as hear sounds up to four times the distance that humans are able to. [ 10 ]  Those with more natural ear shapes, like those of wild canids like the fox, generally hear better than those with the floppier ears of many domesticated species.     [ edit ]   Smell          Scent hounds, especially the  Bloodhound , are bred for their keen sense of smell. [ 11 ]       Dogs have nearly 220 million smell-sensitive cells over an area about the size of a pocket  handkerchief  (compared to 5 million over an area the size of a  postage stamp  for humans). [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  According to nhm.org, dogs can sense odours at concentrations nearly 100 million times lower than humans can. [ 14 ]  According to Dummies.com, the percentage of the dog's brain that is devoted to analyzing smells is actually 40 times larger than that of a human. [ 12 ]  Some dog breeds have been selectively bred for excellence in detecting scents, even compared to their canine brethren.          The highly sensitive nose of a dog.         [ edit ]   Coat       Main article:  Coat (dog)       Domestic dogs often display the remnants of counter-shading, a common natural camouflage pattern. The general theory of countershading is that an animal that is lit from above will appear lighter on its upper half and darker on its lower half where it will usually be in its own shade. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]  This is a pattern that predators can learn to watch for. A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below. [ 15 ]  This reduces the general visibility of the animal. One reminder of this pattern is that many breeds will have the occasional ""blaze"", stripe, or ""star"" of white fur on their chest or undersides. [ 16 ]   Dogs diverged from a now-extinct Asian wolf between 12,000 and 15,000 years ago, according to recent DNA studies. In that time, the long nose and heavy grey-colored double coat of the wolf has changed into the wide variety of dog shapes and coats and colors seen today. The change was due at first to genetic changes that occurred as the original dogs learned to tolerate the presence of humans, as shown in the research on foxes by  Dmitri Belyaev  in his  Farm-Fox Experiment . The research found that a genetic change to tameness brought along other unexpected changes as well; one notable change was in the coats, changed from a typical fox coat to a spotted coat resembling a dog's coat. As ancient dogs learned to live near humans and became less like wolves, their appearance changed as well, long before any selective breeding was done by people. [ 17 ]   A  Stanford University School of Medicine  study published in Science in October, 2007 found the genetics that explain coat colors in other mammals such as in  horse coats  and in  cat coats , did not apply to dogs. [ 18 ]  The project took samples from 38 different breeds to find the gene (a  beta defensin  gene) responsible for dog coat color. One version produces yellow dogs, and a mutation produces black. All dog coat colors are modifications of black or yellow. [ 19 ]  For example, the white in white  miniature schnauzers  is a cream color, not  albinism  (a genotype of e/e at  MC1R .)   Modern dog breeds exhibit a diverse array of fur coats, including dogs without fur, such as the  Mexican Hairless Dog . Dog coats vary in texture, color, and markings, and a specialized vocabulary has evolved to describe each characteristic. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Tail   There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, cork-screw. In some breeds, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries (especially for hunting dogs). [ 21 ]  It can happen that some puppies are born with a short tail or no tail in some breeds. [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Puppy characteristics   Puppies often have characteristics that do not last beyond early puppyhood. Eye color often changes from blue to its adult color as the puppy matures. The coat color may change:  Kerry Blue Terrier  puppies have black coats at birth and change to blue with maturity, and  Dalmatians  are white and gain their spots with age. The ear shape will also often change, especially with erect-eared breeds such as the  German Shepherd Dog  which have soft ears at birth, but the cartilage strengthens with age.  Blue Lacy  Dogs and  Labrador Retrievers , however, stay very much the same through life.   In some countries it is not uncommon for puppies to have their ears  cropped  or straightened and tails  docked . Dogs intended for dog fighting often have their ears severely trimmed. Many countries have banned these practices as animal cruelty.     [ edit ]   Temperature regulation   A common misconception is that dogs do not  sweat . Primarily, dogs regulate their body temperature in a completely different way, through panting [ citation needed ] . That is why, on a hot day or after a dog has been running, its mouth will be seen wide open with the tongue hanging out. This form of cooling maximizes heat loss while conserving moisture, because it carries heat from the hottest part of the body, the interior core of the  thorax . Perspiration cools the body by the evaporation of moisture from the skin. This is much less efficient, because the skin is already the coolest part of the bodyor in more scientific terms, this higher efficiency of thermal loss relative to moisture conservation arises because  heat flow is proportional to temperature gradient . Dogs sweat through the pads of their feet, since they are not furred. On a warm day and after exercise, a dog's naturally wet footprints might be visible on a smooth floor.   Dogs possess a  rete mirabile , a complex of intermingled small arteries and veins, in the  carotid sinus  at the base of their neck. This acts as a  heat exchanger  to thermally isolate the  head , containing the  brain , the most temperature-sensitive organ, from the  body , containing the  muscles , where most of the heat is generated. The result is that dogs can sustain intense physical exertion over a prolonged time in a hot environment, compared to animals which lack this apparatus; thus, a dog chasing a  jackrabbit  through the  desert  may not be able to outrun the rabbit, but it can continue the chase until the rabbit literally drops dead from overheating.     [ edit ]   See also     Canine terminology   Conformation (dog)   Temperament   Grooming   Junior Showmanship     Dogs also are known for dissipating heat through guhingtun, a Chinese term for sweating through the glands above their necks. This gets rid of the heat that is up there on a daily basis     [ edit ]   References       ^   Scientists fetch useful information from dog genome publications, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, December 7, 2005; published online in Bio-Medicine  quote: ""Phenotypic variation among dog breeds, whether it be in size, shape, or behavior, is greater than for any other animal""   ^   ""Why Small Dogs Are Small: Ancient Genetic Material Keeps Pups Pint-Sized"" .

clueweb09-en0010-60-17742	                          Home Topics ... Pet Safety Heat Stroke   Preventing Heat Stroke in Your Pet     When humans get hot, we sweat. When animals get hot, they pant .  Unfortunately, panting is not the most efficient means of cooling down an overheated body.    During those hot summer months we can help our pets stay cool (and prevent heat exhaustion) by taking a few simple precautions:        Provide access to shade and plenty of cool drinking water.     Consider purchasing a kiddy pool and filling it with a few inches of clean water. This is a fun and effective way for your dog to cool down.     Have a well-ventilated doghouse that is kept in the shadeften the plastic types are quite cool inside on a hot day. Doghouses aren't only for dogshey work for cats, too.   If you have a rabbit, keep the hutch in the shaden the wild, rabbits spend the hottest part of the day in their underground burrows where it's cool.    On hot days, the best possible choice is to leave your pet at home, but if you must take him in the car:        Leave car windows completely rolled down for maximum airflow. Use pet-secure window screens or keep your pet in a well-ventilated kennel. Use a travel food and a water feeder to keep fresh water available.     Use a secure dog leash to attach your dog to a shaded post or tree while you get your groceries, deliver your package or pick up your prescription.      Bring a gallon of fresh, cool water and a bowl from home. Some dogs and cats appreciate ice cubes in their water. ( Hint : A six-pack cooler holds about a gallon of water.)    Check on your pet every few minutes.    Pets Susceptible to Heat Stroke   Certain animals are particularly sensitive to heat stroke These include:       young, old and overweight animals      animals with shortened muzzles (i.e. bulldogs, Lhasa apsos, pugs, Pekinese, Persian cats)     animals with heart and/or respiratory problems    animals with thick, heavy coats.    If your pet falls into one of these categories, minimize the likelihood of heat stroke by:        keeping the young, the old and the poor in health out of the heat.      keeping your pet at a healthy weight.   keeping your longhaired cat or dog clipped during the hot months.    Signs of Heat Stroke   Fortunately the signs of heat stroke are pretty obvious. When it's hot, look for:       excessive panting     excessive salivation (drooling and swallowing)     a racing pulse     legs, nose and ears that are hot to the touch (indicates elevated body temperature)    vomiting.    Emergency First Aid   The first thing to do for an overheated pet is to cool her down. At the first signs of heat stroke, bring your pet indoors into air conditioning. Initially, you can treat your pet by immersing her in cool, not cold, water.
