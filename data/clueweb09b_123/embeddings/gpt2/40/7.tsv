Whether it's a 200 year old penny or an ancient Roman coin, collectors of old coins enjoy a fascinating hobby. With their depictions of world leaders, epic battles and political mascots, coins offer a personal glimpse into the events of a country's history. The very idea of a coin being passed from generation to generation infuses old coins with a sense of history and heritage that can be quite powerful.    Part of the charm of these antiquities, and much of their value according to some collectors, is the years of accumulated grunge on their surfaces. While some collectors prefer to trade them in their less-than-pristine condition, others opt for a cleaned and polished coin for their collection. Many experts caution against cleaning coins, saying that exposing the metal to the corrosive agents in the air will cause them to lose value. They suggest a gentle cleaning with mild soap and water to remove excess ground dirt, but skip the polishing. Of course, it's up to you to decide if you like the old worn grime, or opt for shiny bits in your collection. If you plan to clean your old coins, make sure you have the proper equipment to do so safely. Coins, especially older ones, are       susceptible to damage from scratchy cleaners and chemicals. Protect your investment by using a cleaning product especially designed for old       coins. You can find verdigris removers, concentrated liquid soap, special brushes and other cleaning products. Some collectors use a       super-concentrated strength of hydrogen peroxide; use care with this, as too much of a good thing can be bad news for older coins.    When dealing with any coins, especially old ones, it's important to understand a coins value. There are a number of resources out there to help you identify and value your old coins. Try one of these books to start:    * The Early Coins of America by Sylvester S. Crosby, 1990    * Standard Catalog of World Coins, a series of books that covers various time frames    * History of the United States Mint by George Evans, 1888 There are also a number of websites out there dedicated to helping collectors identify their coins. And of course your local hobby shop or coin dealer is a great resource for you. You can also visit coin conventions and trade shows to talk to industry insiders. There you can often find collectors who will offer to value your coins on the spot. But get a second opinion before you sell, to be sure you are getting a good deal. A coins value is determined largely by considering its rarity, its demand, its historical importance, and its general condition. To keep your coin from losing value once you acquire it, be sure to protect it when handling and storing. Treat each coin with care, and consider using inexpensive cotton coin gloves whenever you handle the coin. You can find these at any good coin shop, for around $4 a pair. Handle your coins by their edges only, to avoid wear and keep the oil from your hands from collecting on the coins surfaces.    Proper storage is essential to protecting an old coins value. If you store your coins in paper envelopes or albums, be sure that the paper is acid free and designed specifically to be safe for antiques. Plastic slips should also be avoided for older coins, as they can cause corrosion over time. There are clear acid-free envelopes available for storage, that still allow you to see your coins while offering them a safe place to stay. Expect to pay $15-20 for 100 acid-free envelopes. You can find these items at online coin suppliers, your local hobby shop, or at conventions and trade shows.

A collector could simply be a person that collects them in a jar around the house. If you look at those  coins , though, you will likely find a wide array of dates. By doing this, you might become interested in becoming a traditional  coin  collector other types of  coins .    Becoming a collector isn't going to make you rich. You'll probably never land on a stash of  old  Roman or Celtic  coins  that will bring you fame and fortune. If you want to get into  coin   collecting , do it for the pleasure of hunting down increasingly rare or unique ones.    Some people focus on  collecting   coins  created in a limited edition that are new in the marketplace. Others focus on specific types of  coins , such as  old  Canadian or silver  coin  ones.    A collector needs a few tools of the trade. A magnifying glass to examine details on each of them is one. Envelopes or albums to  store  and display the ones you have are other supplies to purchase. A  coin   collecting  price guide that has information on dates, varieties, and grading guidelines is a smart addition.    A plastic ruler that has both millimeters and inches for measuring them, cotton or latex gloves for handling, a soft cloth to set them on for viewing, and good lighting round out the list of supplies.    Starting your hobby of being a  coin  collector involves hunting down new ones. There are plenty of places to find them for your  collecting . Root in your own wallet (and everyone else's who will let you examine them for less-common ones).    Look at the ones on display at flea markets and auctions. The internet is a great resource for buying, selling, and trading  coins . Always keep your  coin   collecting  price guide handy when shopping to avoid scams or paying too much.    If you are not a professional dealer, do not clean your collection. Using the wrong method to clean them can damage some of the  old  rare  coins  and reduce the value of your collection.    Dirty  coins  are perfectly acceptable when you are a collector. If, however, you want to clean those that have no particular value, you can simply use warm water and dishwashing liquid to give them a shine.    Read as much as you can on your new hobby. A good  coin  collector learns what makes it valuable and be able to recognize those  old  Roman  coins  for more than the symbol stamped on them.    As you grow proficient, you'll be able to let go of most common ones and focus on  old  rare ones instead. If you have children or grandchildren, pass those ones down to them. Who knows; you may just have created a new  coin  collector!     Mike Selvon has a passion for  coin   collecting , and his portal has the best information on  coin  collector .

For collecting, see  coin collecting .

While  numismatists  are often characterized as students or collectors of  coins , the discipline also includes a much larger study of  payment media used to resolve  debts  and the exchange of  goods . Lacking a structured  monetary system , people in the past as well as some today lived in a  barter  society and used locally-found items of inherent or implied value. Early money used by people is referred to as ""Odd and Curious"", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating  currency  (e.g.,  cigarettes  in prison). The  Kyrgyz  people used  horses  as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins. [ 1 ]  The  lambskins  may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horse is not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as  conch shells ,  precious metals  and  gems .   Today, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized or  credit  value. Numismatic value may be used to refer to the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law. This is also known as the ""collector's value"" or ""intrinsic value.""   Economic  and  historical  studies of money's use and development are separate to the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment (although the fields are related; economic theories of money's origin depend upon numismatics, for example).           Contents       1   History of money   2   History of numismatics     2.1   Modern numismatics   2.2   Subfields       3   Numismatists   4   See also   5   Notes               [ edit ]   History of money   Main article:  History of money   Money itself must be a  scarce  good. Many items have been used as money, from naturally scarce  precious metals  and  conch shells  through  cigarettes  to entirely artificial money such as  banknotes . Modern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token - an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today. However, goods such as  gold  or  silver  retain many of the essential properties of money.     [ edit ]   History of numismatics       A  Roman   denarius , a standardized  silver coin .       Coin Collecting may have existed in ancient times. Caesar  Augustus  gave ""coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money"" as  Saturnalia  gifts. [ 2 ]   Petrarch , who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first  Renaissance  collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to  Emperor Charles IV  in 1355.   The first book on coins was  De Asse et Partibus  (1514) by  Guillaume Bud . [ 3 ] . During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope  Boniface VIII , Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire,  Louis XIV  of France, Ferdinand I, Elector  Joachim II  of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and  Henry IV of France  to name a few. Numismatics is called the ""Hobby of Kings"", due to its most esteemed founders.   Professional societies organized in the 19th century. The  Royal Numismatic Society  was founded in 1836 and immediately begin publishing the journal that became the  Numismatic Chronicle . The  American Numismatic Society  was founded in 1858 and began publishing the  American Journal of Numismatics  in 1866.   In 1931 the  British Academy  launched the  Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum  publishing collections of  Ancient Greek coinage . The first volume of  Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles  was published in 1958.   In the 20th century as well the coins were seen more as archaeological objects. After  World War II  in Germany a project,  Fundmnzen der Antike  (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.   In the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. [ 4 ]  William E. Du Bois  Pledges of History...  (1846) describes the cabinet.   C. Wyllys Betts'  American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals  (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.     [ edit ]   Modern numismatics   Modern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid 17th to the 21st century, the period of machine struck coins. Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics lies frequently in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties,  mint-made errors , the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures and even the socio-political context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.     [ edit ]   Subfields   Main articles:  Exonumia ,  Notaphily , and  Scripophily   Exonumia  is the study of  coin -like objects such as  token coins  and  medals , and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes  elongated coins , encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counterstamped coins,  wooden nickels ,  credit cards , and other similar items. It is related to numismatics proper (concerned with coins which have been  legal tender ), and many  coin collectors  are also exonumists.   Notaphily  is the study of  paper money  or banknotes. It is believed that people have been collecting  paper money  for as long as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the  Serienscheine  (Series notes)  Notgeld . The turning point occurred in the 1970s, when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors. At the same time, some developed countries such as the  USA ,  Germany  and  France  began publishing their respective national catalogues of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.   Scripophily  is the study and collection of  stocks  and  Bonds . It is an interesting area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of  engraving . Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as a stock in a successor company.     [ edit ]   Numismatists   The term  numismatist  applies to collectors and coin dealers as well scholars using coins as source or studying coins.   The first group chiefly derive pleasure from the simple ownership of monetary devices and studying these coins as private amateur scholars. In the classical field amateur collector studies have achieved quite remarkable progress in the field. Examples are  Walter Breen , a well-known example of a noted numismatist who was not an avid collector, and King  Farouk I of Egypt  was an avid collector who had very little interest in numismatics. Harry Bass by comparison was a noted collector who was also a numismatist.   The second group are the coin dealers. These often called professional numismatists authenticate or  grade  coins for commercial purposes. The buying and selling of coin collections by numismatists who are professional dealers advances the study of money, and expert numismatists are consulted by historians, museum curators, and archaeologists.   The third category are scholar numismatists working in public collections, universities or as independent scholars acquiring knowledge about monetary devices, their systems, their economy and their historical context. Coins are especially relevant as source in the pre-modern period.     [ edit ]   See also         Look up  numismatics  in   Wiktionary , the free dictionary.

While  numismatists  are often characterized as students or collectors of  coins , the discipline also includes a much larger study of  payment media used to resolve  debts  and the exchange of  goods . Lacking a structured  monetary system , people in the past as well as some today lived in a  barter  society and used locally-found items of inherent or implied value. Early money used by people is referred to as ""Odd and Curious"", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating  currency  (e.g.,  cigarettes  in prison). The  Kyrgyz  people used  horses  as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins. [ 1 ]  The  lambskins  may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horse is not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as  conch shells ,  precious metals  and  gems .   Today, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized or  credit  value. Numismatic value may be used to refer to the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law. This is also known as the ""collector's value"" or ""intrinsic value.""   Economic  and  historical  studies of money's use and development are separate to the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment (although the fields are related; economic theories of money's origin depend upon numismatics, for example).

Many items have been used as money, from naturally scarce  precious metals  and  conch shells  through  cigarettes  to entirely artificial money such as  banknotes . Modern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token - an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today. However, goods such as  gold  or  silver  retain many of the essential properties of money.     [ edit ]   History of numismatics       A  Roman   denarius , a standardized  silver coin .       Coin Collecting may have existed in ancient times. Caesar  Augustus  gave ""coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money"" as  Saturnalia  gifts. [ 2 ]   Petrarch , who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first  Renaissance  collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to  Emperor Charles IV  in 1355.   The first book on coins was  De Asse et Partibus  (1514) by  Guillaume Bud . [ 3 ] . During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope  Boniface VIII , Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire,  Louis XIV  of France, Ferdinand I, Elector  Joachim II  of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and  Henry IV of France  to name a few. Numismatics is called the ""Hobby of Kings"", due to its most esteemed founders.   Professional societies organized in the 19th century. The  Royal Numismatic Society  was founded in 1836 and immediately begin publishing the journal that became the  Numismatic Chronicle . The  American Numismatic Society  was founded in 1858 and began publishing the  American Journal of Numismatics  in 1866.   In 1931 the  British Academy  launched the  Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum  publishing collections of  Ancient Greek coinage . The first volume of  Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles  was published in 1958.   In the 20th century as well the coins were seen more as archaeological objects. After  World War II  in Germany a project,  Fundmnzen der Antike  (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.   In the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. [ 4 ]  William E. Du Bois  Pledges of History...  (1846) describes the cabinet.   C. Wyllys Betts'  American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals  (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.     [ edit ]   Modern numismatics   Modern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid 17th to the 21st century, the period of machine struck coins. Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics lies frequently in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties,  mint-made errors , the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures and even the socio-political context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.     [ edit ]   Subfields       Main articles:  Exonumia ,  Notaphily , and  Scripophily       Exonumia  is the study of  coin -like objects such as  token coins  and  medals , and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes  elongated coins , encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counterstamped coins,  wooden nickels ,  credit cards , and other similar items. It is related to numismatics proper (concerned with coins which have been  legal tender ), and many  coin collectors  are also exonumists.   Notaphily  is the study of  paper money  or banknotes. It is believed that people have been collecting  paper money  for as long as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the  Serienscheine  (Series notes)  Notgeld . The turning point occurred in the 1970s, when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors. At the same time, some developed countries such as the  USA ,  Germany  and  France  began publishing their respective national catalogues of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.   Scripophily  is the study and collection of  stocks  and  Bonds . It is an interesting area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of  engraving . Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as a stock in a successor company.     [ edit ]   Numismatists   The term  numismatist  applies to collectors and coin dealers as well scholars using coins as source or studying coins.   The first group chiefly derive pleasure from the simple ownership of monetary devices and studying these coins as private amateur scholars. In the classical field amateur collector studies have achieved quite remarkable progress in the field. Examples are  Walter Breen , a well-known example of a noted numismatist who was not an avid collector, and King  Farouk I of Egypt  was an avid collector who had very little interest in numismatics. Harry Bass by comparison was a noted collector who was also a numismatist.   The second group are the coin dealers. These often called professional numismatists authenticate or  grade  coins for commercial purposes. The buying and selling of coin collections by numismatists who are professional dealers advances the study of money, and expert numismatists are consulted by historians, museum curators, and archaeologists.   The third category are scholar numismatists working in public collections, universities or as independent scholars acquiring knowledge about monetary devices, their systems, their economy and their historical context. Coins are especially relevant as source in the pre-modern period.     [ edit ]   See also         Look up  numismatics  in   Wiktionary , the free dictionary.

While  numismatists  are often characterized as students or collectors of  coins , the discipline also includes a much larger study of  payment media used to resolve  debts  and the exchange of  goods . Lacking a structured  monetary system , people in the past as well as some today lived in a  barter  society and used locally-found items of inherent or implied value. Early money used by people is referred to as ""Odd and Curious"", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating  currency  (e.g.,  cigarettes  in prison). The  Kyrgyz  people used  horses  as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins. [ 1 ]  The  lambskins  may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horse is not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as  conch shells ,  precious metals  and  gems .   Today, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized or  credit  value. Numismatic value may be used to refer to the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law. This is also known as the ""collector's value"" or ""intrinsic value.""   Economic  and  historical  studies of money's use and development are separate to the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment (although the fields are related; economic theories of money's origin depend upon numismatics, for example).

Many items have been used as money, from naturally scarce  precious metals  and  conch shells  through  cigarettes  to entirely artificial money such as  banknotes . Modern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token - an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today. However, goods such as  gold  or  silver  retain many of the essential properties of money.     [ edit ]   History of numismatics       A  Roman   denarius , a standardized  silver coin .       Coin Collecting may have existed in ancient times. Caesar  Augustus  gave ""coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money"" as  Saturnalia  gifts. [ 2 ]   Petrarch , who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first  Renaissance  collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to  Emperor Charles IV  in 1355.   The first book on coins was  De Asse et Partibus  (1514) by  Guillaume Bud . [ 3 ] . During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope  Boniface VIII , Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire,  Louis XIV  of France, Ferdinand I, Elector  Joachim II  of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and  Henry IV of France  to name a few. Numismatics is called the ""Hobby of Kings"", due to its most esteemed founders.   Professional societies organized in the 19th century. The  Royal Numismatic Society  was founded in 1836 and immediately begin publishing the journal that became the  Numismatic Chronicle . The  American Numismatic Society  was founded in 1858 and began publishing the  American Journal of Numismatics  in 1866.   In 1931 the  British Academy  launched the  Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum  publishing collections of  Ancient Greek coinage . The first volume of  Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles  was published in 1958.   In the 20th century as well the coins were seen more as archaeological objects. After  World War II  in Germany a project,  Fundmnzen der Antike  (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.   In the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. [ 4 ]  William E. Du Bois  Pledges of History...  (1846) describes the cabinet.   C. Wyllys Betts'  American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals  (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.     [ edit ]   Modern numismatics   Modern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid 17th to the 21st century, the period of machine struck coins. Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics lies frequently in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties,  mint-made errors , the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures and even the socio-political context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.     [ edit ]   Subfields   Main articles:  Exonumia ,  Notaphily , and  Scripophily   Exonumia  is the study of  coin -like objects such as  token coins  and  medals , and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes  elongated coins , encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counterstamped coins,  wooden nickels ,  credit cards , and other similar items.

While  numismatists  are often characterized as students or collectors of  coins , the discipline also includes a much larger study of  payment media used to resolve  debts  and the exchange of  goods . Lacking a structured  monetary system , people in the past as well as some today lived in a  barter  society and used locally-found items of inherent or implied value. Early money used by people is referred to as ""Odd and Curious"", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating  currency  (e.g.,  cigarettes  in prison). The  Kyrgyz  people used  horses  as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins. [ 1 ]  The  lambskins  may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horse is not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as  conch shells ,  precious metals  and  gems .   Today, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized or  credit  value. Numismatic value may be used to refer to the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law. This is also known as the ""collector's value"" or ""intrinsic value.""   Economic  and  historical  studies of money's use and development are separate to the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment (although the fields are related; economic theories of money's origin depend upon numismatics, for example).

Many items have been used as money, from naturally scarce  precious metals  and  conch shells  through  cigarettes  to entirely artificial money such as  banknotes . Modern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token - an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today. However, goods such as  gold  or  silver  retain many of the essential properties of money.     [ edit ]   History of numismatics       A  Roman   denarius , a standardized  silver coin .       Coin Collecting may have existed in ancient times. Caesar  Augustus  gave ""coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money"" as  Saturnalia  gifts. [ 2 ]   Petrarch , who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first  Renaissance  collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to  Emperor Charles IV  in 1355.   The first book on coins was  De Asse et Partibus  (1514) by  Guillaume Bud . [ 3 ] . During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope  Boniface VIII , Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire,  Louis XIV  of France, Ferdinand I, Elector  Joachim II  of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and  Henry IV of France  to name a few. Numismatics is called the ""Hobby of Kings"", due to its most esteemed founders.   Professional societies organized in the 19th century. The  Royal Numismatic Society  was founded in 1836 and immediately begin publishing the journal that became the  Numismatic Chronicle . The  American Numismatic Society  was founded in 1858 and began publishing the  American Journal of Numismatics  in 1866.   In 1931 the  British Academy  launched the  Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum  publishing collections of  Ancient Greek coinage . The first volume of  Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles  was published in 1958.   In the 20th century as well the coins were seen more as archaeological objects. After  World War II  in Germany a project,  Fundmnzen der Antike  (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.   In the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. [ 4 ]  William E. Du Bois  Pledges of History...  (1846) describes the cabinet.   C. Wyllys Betts'  American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals  (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.     [ edit ]   Modern numismatics   Modern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid 17th to the 21st century, the period of machine struck coins. Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics lies frequently in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties,  mint-made errors , the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures and even the socio-political context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.     [ edit ]   Subfields   Main articles:  Exonumia ,  Notaphily , and  Scripophily   Exonumia  is the study of  coin -like objects such as  token coins  and  medals , and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes  elongated coins , encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counterstamped coins,  wooden nickels ,  credit cards , and other similar items. It is related to numismatics proper (concerned with coins which have been  legal tender ), and many  coin collectors  are also exonumists.   Notaphily  is the study of  paper money  or banknotes. It is believed that people have been collecting  paper money  for as long as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the  Serienscheine  (Series notes)  Notgeld . The turning point occurred in the 1970s, when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors. At the same time, some developed countries such as the  USA ,  Germany  and  France  began publishing their respective national catalogues of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.   Scripophily  is the study and collection of  stocks  and  Bonds . It is an interesting area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of  engraving . Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as a stock in a successor company.

Generally, these misconceptions and falsehoods promote the notion that the government may again call in gold as it did in 1933 and that ""reportable"" transactions are preludes to confiscation. By cultivating such fears in investors, unscrupulous firms can sell high-priced (and often overpriced) coins with greater margins of profit.    Investors who believe these stories invariably pay too much or buy the wrong coins. After reading this Web page, no investor need be taken advantage of.                                         Avoiding Gold Confiscation                           The most frequently used technique to promote high-priced coins is to raise the issue of confiscation. Many telemarketers tell investors that   old U.S. gold coins  are not ""subject to confiscation,"" leaving the impression that modern gold bullion coins are. Consequently, many investors buy old U.S. gold coins at prices significantly higher than the value of their gold content. The idea of buying ""non-confiscateable'' gold sounds like a powerful argument but wilts under scrutiny.     Many precious metals firms maintain that old U.S. gold coins, proof sets, and commemorative gold coins are ""collectibles"" and would not be subject to another gold recall. Some firms say that premiums of at least 15% automatically make coins collectibles. Another notion holds that coins one hundred years or older are antiques and therefore not subject to confiscation. One large firm that sells rare coins goes as far as to say:     Under current federal law, gold bullion can be confiscated by the federal government in times of national crisis. As collectibles, rare coins do not fall within the provisions permitting confiscation.     No federal law or Treasury department regulation supports these contentions.     The myth that specific types of gold coins are ""not confiscateable"" stems from the Executive Order that President Roosevelt issued in 1933 calling in gold. The Executive Order exempted ""gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins,"" but it did not define special value or collector, and certainly not collectibles. Nevertheless, telemarketers promoting old U.S. gold coins perpetuate this myth because it makes easier the selling of high-priced coins.     Just because Roosevelt exempted ""gold coins having a recognized special value"" does not mean that any future call-in would exempt collectibles. Roosevelt's Executive Order would have no legal binding on another gold call-in. Besides, on December 31, 1974, with Executive Order 11825, President Gerald Ford repealed the Executive Order that Roosevelt used to call in gold in 1933. This was necessary because on the same day Congress restored Americans' right to own gold. Furthermore, in 1977 Congress removed the president's authority to regulate gold transactions during a period of national emergency other than war.     Even if a law did exempt certain coins from future confiscation, the government could change that law. Sadly, the government often simply ignores laws. Dealers who say they sell ""non-confiscateable"" gold have no basis for making such claims.    For further discussion of this matter, assume there were another gold call-in. Would old U.S. gold coins, which make up the bulk of the ""non-confiscateable"" market, be exempted? Probably not because they are common coins. (The old U.S. gold coins most often promoted are the $20 Libertys and the $20 St. Gaudens, also known as Double Eagles. A $10 coin is called an Eagle, a $5 coin a Half Eagle, and a $2-1/2 coin a Quarter Eagle.)    Although Roosevelt's Executive Order required Americans to turn in their gold coins and gold bullion, foreigners continued to redeem paper dollars for gold until August 15, 1971, when President Nixon closed the gold window. From the end of World War II to 1971, our gold reserves were cut in half.     It is generally believed that all the gold coins surrendered under Roosevelt's call-in were melted or refined into .999 fine bullion bars. That was not the case. It was to the government's advantage to give the foreigners gold coins instead of bullion bars.     With the official price of gold at $35 an ounce, a foreign bank presenting $35 million paper dollars received 1,000,000 ounces if the Treasury delivered gold bullion. However, when the Treasury delivered gold coins with a face value of $35 million, it delivered only 967,500 ounces, saving 32,500 ounces. Each $20 Liberty and St. Gaudens (Double Eagles) contains .9675 ounce of gold. The smaller coins contain the same proportions. Therefore, it was to the Treasury Department's advantage to give out U.S. gold coins instead of bullion bars. Additionally, before Roosevelt's call-in, millions of old U.S. gold coins already had made their way to Europe.     So, in view of the government's policy of delivering ""confiscated"" gold coins to foreign governments, how can a promoter of old U.S. gold coins claim to be selling ""non-confiscateable"" gold when the coins he delivers may have been called in back in 1933?     Promoters of old U.S. gold coins rarely reveal the sources of their coins. They foster the idea that the coins they sell somehow survived the 1933 call-in. Probably, the coins being promoted just arrived from Europe a few weeks earlier. Several large numismatic wholesale firms have offices in Europe for finding hoards of old U.S. coins. One firm advertises ""Shipments coming in from Europe daily."" Another firm boasts offices in Brussels, Paris, and Zurich.     As noted above, the premise of ""non-confiscateable"" gold lies in Roosevelt's Executive Order that exempted ""gold coins having recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins."" Are old U.S. gold coins ""rare and unusual"" today? Not hardly.     Between 1850 and 1907, U.S. mints turned out over 100 million $20 Libertys. Between 1908 and 1933, they coined some 65 million $20 St. Gaudens. Today, no one knows how many have survived, but the number is undoubtedly in the tens of millions, with the bulk of them residing in European bank vaults.     Because of all the old U.S. gold coins in Europe and because of the huge premiums they carry, old U.S. coins are dangerous investments. As gold moves higher, European banks may become sellers, causing old U.S. gold coins to fall in price while gold goes up.     Or, the European banks may decide to hold their gold but convert their high-premium old U.S. coins into bullion, thereby increasing their gold holdings. Such a move, of course, would put downward pressure on old U.S. gold coin prices. (For a further discussion about why old U.S. gold coins are overpriced, visit our page on Old U.S. Gold Coins.)     Since 1989, PCGS and NGC, the two major grading services, have ""slabbed"" over two million coins rated MS-60 or higher. Now, the two services are grading 200,000 to 300,000 coins a month. Millions of lower-grade coins (VF through BU) do not even warrant being submitted. Yet, they are sold as ""non-confiscateable"" semi-numismatic coins. Low-grade coins that have no real collector value are called semi-numismatic. VF/XF common-date Double Eagles are definitely semi-numismatic coins.     Add in the uncounted smaller denomination old gold coins ($10 Eagles, $5 Half Eagles, etc.) and the number of available old U.S. gold coins grows even bigger. There is no way the old U.S. gold coins being promoted as ""non-confiscateable"" have a ""recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.""     The concept of ""non-confiscateable"" gold is counterfeit. The idea lives only because dealers continue to push it for their own benefit. Investors who do not have the facts are unable to know otherwise. Readers of this Web page, however, need not be victims to the hype and promotion so prevalent in the gold coin industry.     Investors wanting to buy gold should go with the bullion coins: American Gold Eagles, Maple Leafs, or Krugerrands. These coins move dollar for dollar with the world price of gold and are easy to buy, sell, and trade. Additionally, tracking the value of these coins is easy. No ""expert"" has to look at them.                                         Avoid European Coins                           Over the last few years, telemarketers have been importing European bullion gold coins dated before 1933 and claiming they, like old U.S. gold coins, would be legally beyond the reach of the government in another recall. The imported coins most commonly promoted as non-confiscateable include:      French Twenty Francs (both the Roosters and the Angels);   British Sovereigns (usually with the images of Queen Victoria or Edward II or George V);   Swiss Twenty Francs (also called Helvetias);     Belgium Twenty Francs (a.k.a. King Leopolds);       Swedish and Danish 10 Kroners (Mermaids);       Swedish and Danish 20 Kroners;       Dutch 10 Guilders.     Investors should avoid European coins. As noted above, the notion of ""non-confiscateable"" coins has no merit, and dealers promoting European coins do so because they provide bigger profits. That's bigger profits for the dealers, not their clients.     European coins are not worth the high prices promoters ask. Regardless of the dates on them, they are not ""non-confiscateable."" Additionally, they hold little, if any, numismatic potential. It is a peculiarity of the coin collecting that coins are prized by numismatists (coin collectors) only in their countries of origin. Americans collect U.S. coins; the British collect coins of Great Britain; the Japanese collect Japanese coins, etc.     Furthermore, the European coins are often compared with old U.S. gold coins, which can and do achieve premiums at times (See Old U.S. Gold Coins). European coins, as a rule, are simply bullion coins and will never attain genuine numismatic premiums. Some of the coins have been around for a hundred years and have always sold at only a few dollars above the value of their gold content. That is why telemarketers promote them. They buy the European coins near bullion prices and mark them up, ensuring big profits for themselves    Still, there are other reasons for not buying European coins, even when you can get them at reasonable prices. First, they contain unconventional amounts of gold, such as .1867 oz, or .2354 oz, or .1947 oz. Americans prefer full ounce coins, or fractions of ounces they easily understand, such as 1/2-oz, 1/4-oz, or 1/10-oz.     Second, Americans prefer coins stamped in English. The European coins, obviously, are stamped in the languages of their countries of origin. But perhaps worse, the European coins do not have their gold content stamped on them. If you have to use such coins in an emergency, how are you going to convince someone other than a coin dealer that the coins contain the gold content you say?     Your best buys in fractional-ounce gold coins are American Eagles, Canadian Maple Leafs, or Krugerrands, although fractional-ounce Krugerrands can be difficult to find at times. These coins have their gold content stamped in English and come in sizes Americans are used to dealing with. Always, these coins are cheaper than promoted European coins. Even when you find European coins at bullion prices, fractional-ounce Gold Eagles, Maple Leafs, or Krugerrands are comparably priced. There are no compelling reasons for Americans to buy European coins. Americans should buy Gold Eagles, Maple Leafs, or Krugerrands.                                                Reportable Purchases   Often, promoters will claim that the coins they offer are not subject to ""reporting."" Such statements imply the government requires gold transactions be reported. However, no government regulations require the reporting of the purchases of any precious metals, per se. If payment is made by cash greater than $10,000, however, it becomes a ""cash reporting transaction."" It is not the gold that the government wants reported but the cash. Such reporting applies to all business transactions involving more than $10,000 cash.     Regarding cash transactions, Official General Instructions for IRS Form 8300 read: ""Who Must File. - Each person engaged in a trade or business who, during that trade or business, receives more than $10,000 in cash in one transaction or two or more related transactions must file Form 8300. Any transactions conducted between a payer (or its agent) and the recipient in a 24-hour period are related transactions.     This regulation applies to cash - greenbacks, paper money. It does not apply to personal checks, wire transfers, or money market withdrawals. When cashier's checks or money orders are involved, cash reporting may be triggered.     Form 8300's General Instructions define as cash ""a cashier's check, bank draft, traveler's check, or money order having a face amount of not more than $10,000."" Using a cashier's check less than $10,000 would be a ""cash transaction,"" but it would not be reportable because it is less than $10,000. However, two cashier's checks, each less than $10,000 but totaling more than $10,000 for a single purchase, would be considered cash and subject to reporting.     Further clarification: If an investor makes a $15,000 investment in gold and pays with a single $15,000 cashier's check, it is not reportable. If, however, he pays with two or more cashier's checks each less than $10,000, the dealer would be obligated to report.     Cash reporting requirements were not written specifically for the precious metals industry but for all businesses. The purchase of a car, boat, or jewelry, and payment with two cashier's checks, each less than $10,000 but totaling more than $10,000, would be a reportable transaction.     Another example: an investor agrees to buy precious metals totaling more than $10,000, again say $15,000, and wants to make payments with money from two accounts. If the investor withdraws $8,000 from the first account and gets a cashier's check, and then gets another cashier's check for $7,000 from the second account, the transaction becomes reportable. A purchase of $30,000 and payment with two $15,000 cashier's checks would not be a reportable transaction. The significant amount is $10,000.    Personal checks or checks drawn on the payer's own account are not considered cash. Form 8300's General Instructions read: ""Cash does not include a check drawn on the payer's own account, such as a personal check, regardless of the amount. ""                                         Related Transactions    Form 8300's General Instructions say ""Transactions are considered related even if they occur over a period of more than twenty-four hours if the recipient knows, or has reason to know, that each transaction is one of a series of connected transactions."" For example, if an investor agrees to buy $20,000 in gold but makes installment payments with cash in amounts less than $10,000, the purchase would be reportable.                                                                               Bank Reporting   It is often erroneously thought that banks report to the government all personal checks more than $10,000. Banks do not. But, a cash transaction exceeding $10,000 requires a bank to fill out and file a Cash Transaction Report (CTR). A cash deposit more than $10,000 to any bank or other financial institution account by an individual possibly would be reported.     However, purchases of cashier's checks with cash for amounts $3,000 to $10,000 require banks to complete Monetary Instrument Reports (MIRs). (Some banks call them Monetary Instrument Logs.) MIRs are not filed with the government but are records that enable banks to help comply with cash reporting requirements. It is not clear when a MIR requires the completion and filing of a CTR, but an individual regularly purchasing cashier's checks between $3,000 and $10,000 would probably be reported.     If a business reports a cash transaction, the customer will know it. Form 8300 requires name, address, citizenship, and social security number. It also asks for method of identification, driver's license, passport, etc. Additionally, Form 8300's General Instructions call for anyone filing a Form 8300 to ""provide a written statement to each person named in a required Form 8300 on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the cash is received.""     Finally, Form 8300 General Instructions has a box to be marked if the transactions appear ""suspicious."" The box can be marked for transactions less than $10,000 if the recipient believes the purchaser is trying to avoid cash reporting.     No one wants any red flags at the IRS. Unscrupulous dealers know this and use it to avert clear thinking; they use the threat of ""reporting"" to raise investor fear. This enables them to sell overpriced coins. Investors justify higher prices by thinking they are getting ""non-reportable gold."" No investor need be taken advantage of this way.                                                             Reportable Sales                           Customer sales to dealers of certain precious metals exceeding specific quantities call for reporting to the IRS on 1099B forms. The 1099B forms are similar to other 1099 forms taxpayers commonly receive; the ""B"" means they have been issued by a business other than a financial entity.     Reportable sales (again, customer sales to dealers) apply to 1-oz Gold Maple Leafs, 1-oz Krugerrands, and 1-oz Mexican Onzas in quantities of twenty-five or more in one transaction. Reporting requirements do not apply to American Gold Eagles, no matter the quantities. Furthermore, reporting requirements do not apply to any fractional ounce gold coins.     Only one common silver product is reportable when sold: pre-1965 U.S. coins. The quantity that causes the filing of a 1099B, however, is not clear. The IRS bases its authority to require reporting on CFTC-approved contracts that call for the delivery of $10,000 face value. Consequently, many dealers do not report sales of pre-1965 U.S. coins unless the sale totals $10,000 face value; others report $1,000 sales.     Sales of  American Silver Eagle s, privately-minted Silver Eagle  1-oz  silver rounds , and 100-oz   silver bars  are not reportable, no matter the quantity. Other precious metals products are reportable, but they are not covered here because the average investor does not trade them.     Most investors have no first-hand knowledge of these matters; consequently, when precious metals dealers talk about cash reporting, 8300 forms, or 1099s, investors are unable to know that they may not be hearing the whole story. Wanting to avoid the government knowing about their precious metals investments, many investors are delighted to learn that their purchases will not be reported and end up buying overpriced coins.     As explained under ""Reportable Purchases,"" no precious metals purchases are reported unless cash reporting thresholds are exceeded. Investors wanting to avoid reportable sales should buy American Eagles.     The above discussions about cash reporting, IRS Form 8300, and bank reporting are for editorial purposes only and should not be relied on as definitive and final. Persons involved in cash transactions should consult their attorney or accountant.     Investors wanting to buy gold should go with the popular bullion coins:   Krugerrands   or  American Gold Eagles .  These coins move dollar for dollar with the   world price of gold  and are easy to buy, sell, and trade. Additionally, tracking the value of these coins is easy. No ""expert"" has to look at them.

These coins served as money in this country until 1933, until they were called in by President Franklin Roosevelt.  Other popular old U.S. gold coins are the $10, $5, $2-1/2, and $1 coins, both the Liberty type and the Indian Head type. Whereas the $20 coins are dubbed Double Eagles, the $10 coins are called Eagles, the $5 coins Half Eagles, and the $2-1/2 coins Quarter Eagles.     Old U.S. gold coins are good investments only when they sell at spot or at small premiums over spot. Look at the graph that tracks VF-grade $20 Libertys against the spot price of gold. At times, VF $20 Libs have traded at spot and at other times they have carried big premiums. Specifically, in the early 1980s, the late 1980s, and early 1990s, VF $20 Libs traded at spot; however, in the mid-1980s and the mid- to late-1990s, they gained premiums. Graphs that plot higher-grade Double Eagles' prices against spot show the same relationship. In 1992, MS-62 St. Gaudens sold at $20 over spot. CMIGS believes premiums on old U.S. gold coins could shrink further as the price of gold climbs higher.    View Graph >>    Typically, old U.S. gold coins pick up premiums during periods of heavy promotions. The graph shows two such periods.        In the early 1980s, when gold prices were in decline after their run-up to $850 in 1980, little new money was entering the gold market. As a result, many dealers recommended that South African Krugerrands, which dominated the bullion coin market then, be traded for old U.S. gold coins because Krugerrands were going to be confiscated.        Confiscation was an easy story to sell because South Africa's apartheid system was being condemned worldwide and the negative publicity surrounding the issue lent credence to the idea of confiscation. However, only a symbolic ban on the importation of Krugerrands was imposed, and there was never any proposal in Congress (or anywhere else for that matter) to confiscate Krugerrands. Nevertheless, many investors switched to old U.S. gold coins and their premiums rose substantially. In time, though, the fear of confiscation died, and premiums shrank.         In 1998, as apprehension grew about the approach of the year 2000, the gold coin market became ripe for another promotion of old U.S. gold coins. This time promoters hyped them as protection against the collapse of the world's computers and the banking system. The fear was so widespread that bank regulators required Y2K compliance. Today, Y2K is a faint memory.         Nevertheless, Y2K was a real concern to many investors who accepted the notion of old U.S. gold coins being ""non-confiscateable."" ""Confiscation"" is a theory that holds no validity, but again premiums on old U.S. gold coins climbed. However, when January 1, 2000, rolled around and no problems arose, investors began selling and premiums dropped precipitously. For a further discussion on the promotion of old U.S. gold coins, read  Myths, Misunderstandings, and Outright Lies.         Another big danger to investing in old U.S. gold coins is the huge overhang in Europe. At the end of WWII, the United States held the world's largest hoard of gold, and U.S. dollars were redeemable in gold by foreign governments. Following the war, the U.S. poured billions into rebuilding Europe via the Marshall Plan. Additionally, to stimulate European economic growth, the U.S. opened its markets to European goods. Consequently, massive quantities of dollars flowed to Europe.        As prosperity returned, Europeans converted those billions of dollars to gold. So great was the conversion that on August 15, 1971, President Nixon closed the ""gold window"" because the redemptions threatened to empty U.S. gold vaults. Much of the gold sent to Europe was old U.S. gold coin. Even before WWII, U.S. gold coins had been popular in Europe, and gold-loving Europeans hoarded them.         No reliable statistics are available on how many old U.S. gold coins European banks hold, but, undoubtedly, it is in the tens of millions. Between 1850 and 1933, U.S. mints turned out more than 165 million Double Eagles. The mints also produced millions of smaller gold coins. Today, several large numismatic wholesale firms have offices in Europe for finding hoards of old U.S. coins. One firm used to advertise ""Shipments coming in from Europe daily."" Another firm boasts ""Offices in Brussels, Paris, and Zurich.""         Although European central banks have been sellers of gold in recent years, holders of old U.S. gold coins have curtailed sales.  Despite the reduced supply, premiums on old U.S. gold coins have shrunk. CMIGS believes premiums on old U.S. gold coins will fall further because of the overhang in Europe.        As gold rallies back to a level where Europeans again become sellers, old U.S. gold coins will flood the market. VF $20 Libs will again sell at spot; MS-62 St. Gaudens will sell at bullion coin prices. So, while old U.S. gold coins have significant premiums, bullion coins are the better buys. CMIGS recommends The Perth Mint's Gold Horses because they sell at bullion coin prices but have numismatic potential.         Although bullion coins are the better investment right now, when Double Eagles again sell at or near spot, they will be the better buys.  Double Eagles will be the better investment because someday they will again achieve premiums and provide investors the opportunity to increase the number of ounces of gold they own without laying out any more cash. A real-life example illustrates the principle.         In the late 1980s, a CMIGS client purchased 192 VF $20 Libs. By looking at the graph, you can see the client bought the coins near the spot price of gold. In 1998, when the premiums were high, the client traded the 192 $20 Libs for 1-oz Gold Eagles. The client received 236 Gold Eagles for a 50-ounce increase. It was a 50-ounce increase because a Double Eagle contains .9675 ounce of gold. So, the client traded 186 ounces (192 X .9675 = 185.76) of gold for 236. Gold coin buyers should keep this trading strategy in mind. It can be quite profitable.        Coin Grades      Anyone investing in old U.S. gold coins soon hears about ""coin grades."" A coin's ""grade"" is a visual evaluation of how much wear a coin has suffered. Coins with little wear are graded higher and bring higher prices than those with significant wear. However, a low-grade key coin could easily be more valuable than a high-grade common-date coin. A key coin is a difficult to find, rare coin. By contrast, common-date coins are in abundance.        Below is the spectrum of coin grades as developed by the American Numismatic Association (ANA). The discussion that follows is to inform new investors as to the complexities of coin grading; it is not a guide to coin grading. Investors wanting to become more knowledgeable about old U.S. gold coins and grading them should get a copy of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, commonly called The Red Book. Send $12 to Certified Mint, and we will mail you a copy.              Low-grade coins show considerable wear. Coins graded MS-60 are considered Mint State (Mint State [MS] is used interchangeably with uncirculated). Mint State coins have no signs of wear but may show contact marks, and the surface may be spotted or lack some luster. Coins graded MS-61 and higher should have increasing luster or be lightly toned with very few contact marks. The greater the luster or toning and fewer the contact marks, the higher the grading. An MS-70 coin would be in perfect condition. Very few regular issue coins are graded MS-70.        Anyone can easily see the wear on low-end coins, but accurately determining whether a coin is an F-12 or VF-20 requires experience in coin grading. Differentiating between an AU-55 and an MS-60 coin calls for even more skill. Finally, grading a coin either MS-62 or MS-63 becomes subjective, and ""experts"" often disagree. Consequently, the grading services have become invaluable to investors.        PCGS, NGC, and ""Slabbed"" Coins           In the mid-1980s, over-grading had become wide spread. It was common for circulated coins (below MS-60) to be put in plastic holders (""slabbed""), labeled MS-62 or MS-63, and sold to unsuspecting investors.        Since the buyers usually could not detect the over-grading, they did not know they had been taken advantage of until they sold. One investor in the late 1980s put $150,000 into old U.S. gold coins, many of which had been graded MS-62 or MS-63 by the firm from which he bought them. Three years later - at the suggestion of CMIGS - he submitted them to PCGS and learned that most of the coins had been over-graded by as much as five grades. His $150,000 investment was worth less than $35,000. Unfortunately, this investor's situation was not unique. It appears that thousands of investors have suffered similar losses.        Ethical numismatists decried the over-grading and screamed that it was damaging coin collecting - and it was. Then Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) launched a unique concept in 1986. PCGS would only grade coins. The company would not sell coins. Its income would be derived only from grading fees, and it would survive only if it did a credible job.        There are many skilled numismatists across the country, and while most of them do not always agree with PCGS grading, PCGS thrives because its grading is fair and competent. PCGS now grades 100,000 to 150,000 coins a month.        In 1986, Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC) sprung up to provide still another grading service. And, NGC has prospered, also grading thousands of coins monthly. PCGS and NGC have been so successful that no major retail firms now ""slab"" their own coins. (Putting a coin in a plastic holder with its grade marked on the holder is called ""slabbing."") Other grading services have attempted to emulate PCGS and NGC, but none have become as accepted as have the two major grading services.       PCGS's and NGC's coin grading services provide a greatly needed benefit to investors who purchase old U.S. gold coins. Now, investors can buy coins that probably are graded accurately. Although coin grading has definite guidelines, coin grading remains as subjective as a beauty contest. A coin can be slabbed MS-62, and two knowledgeable numismatists - both with more experience than the PCGS or NGC graders--can disagree. One may say it's a MS-61, while the other says it's a MS-63!        Just because a coin is slabbed doesn't mean its grade is final. Many coin dealers resubmit coins, asking for a higher grading. Often, they get it. Other coin dealers frequently bust the coins out of their holders and resubmit. Coin grading is that subjective.        In fact, slabbed coins trade ""sight-seen"" and ""sight-unseen."" Sight-seen means buyers have to see the coins and agree with the grading before paying. Sight-unseen means buyers will take the coins without seeing them.        One longtime numismatist claims that ""a coin's unique appearance, luster, toning, depth of strike or peculiarities can affect offers as much as 100% in rare cases."" Unique coins usually trade ""sight-seen,"" while common-date MS-61s, -62s, and -63s trade ""sight- unseen."" It takes great knowledge to profitably trade in old U.S. gold coins.        Gold investors should avoid old U.S. gold coins and the numismatic market. Numismatics (coin collecting) is a world of its own. Many pitfalls await novice investors, the worst being overpriced coins from unprincipled dealers. Although over-graded coins ceased to be a problem after PCGS and NGC started slabbing coins, overpriced coins remains a major hazard for gold coin buyers. Furthermore, liquidity can be a major problem .        The longtime numismatist mentioned above recommends ""allowing at least 30 days for a dealer to sell your rare coins."" He says ""sudden emergency liquidation can reduce your realized price by 5% to 20%."" That's a generous evaluation of the numismatic market. If you're sold overpriced coins, you can watch 50% of your investment disappear regardless how much time you give a dealer. Besides, do you really want to put a part of your life's savings in something that may take 30 days to liquidate? What if it takes 60 days, or 120?       Consider also another tip offered by the above numismatist on ""How to Sell Your Coins at Maximum Prices.""             Find a dealer you can trust          Okay, but how do you find that honest dealer? How many corrupt dealers do you go through finding him? How much do you lose in bad buys before you connect with an honest dealer?         Why not invest in gold you can trust, gold that moves dollar for dollar with the world price of gold? Why not buy gold bullion coins that can be liquidated at prices which can be determined by anyone? Why not put your money in gold coins that make you the ""expert"" on how much they are worth?       Here's another tip from the numismatist:              Always have your current expert get offers from the dealer who sold you the coins originally. Different dealers support different markets.          This advice exposes two more flaws of investing in numismatic coins. First, your ""current expert"" has to go back to your former ""expert."" Why aren't you still dealing with the original expert? Again, how many ""experts"" do you have to go through before you find that honest dealer?         Second, you should never invest in a coin whose value is determined by the support of a certain dealer or marketing organization. Those firms move from coin to coin, always wanting to have ""something new"" to offer their customers. When they move on, previous promoted coins suffer. Avoid this problem by investing in bullion coins.        This Web page is long, and you are to be congratulated for reading this far. Your time has been well spent. What you have learned could save you thousands of dollars and great heartache.        The unfortunate story told above about the man who invested $150,000 but received coins worth $35,000 is not unique. A husband and wife a few years ago had CMIGS evaluate a group of common-date ""slabbed"" MS-62 Double Eagles. They had paid $72,000 for the coins. Sadly, they should have paid no more than $48,000. They suffered an immediate loss of $24,000, one-third of their investment.        In early 1998, another investor who wanted only to invest in gold called a firm that advertises Gold Eagles extensively. However, after being told that numismatic coins were ""not confiscateable,"" he put $27,000 into a variety of old U.S. gold coins graded MS-62 through MS-65. He subsequently learned that the coins could be sold for only about $21,000. The man suffered an immediate $6,000 or 22% loss.        Such losses can be avoided by investing in bullion coins. Don't take unnecessary risks with your money.        (For a discussion as to why you should buy gold and silver, click here.)

Wednesday January 7, 2009   If you're anywhere within a couple of hundred miles of Orlando, Florida late this week, make it a point to stop by the Orange County Convention Center to check out the FUN Coin Show.  FUN stands for Florida United Numismatists, which is one of the largest and most well-organized coin clubs in America. Since 1955, they have sponsored an annual winter coin convention in Florida, and that show has grown to one of the largest in the nation.  This year's show, which opens to the public on Thursday (Jan. 7), will feature a bourse floor with more 600 coin dealers setting up shop.  An estimated 15,000 visitors will pass through the doors during the four days of the convention.    Like most large coin shows, the FUN Show will have a large competitive exhibit area, where collectors will be showing off the best of their collections while vying for recognition from the judges.    Numerous educational presentations will be given, including the one that I will be giving with  Coin World  editor Beth Deisher about the Chinese counterfeiting problem.  Our talk is on Friday at 2:30 pm in Room 220C.  Plan to arrive early if you want a seat because word has it that this topic will be very popular.  I'll be presenting an update on the Chinese threat, and attendees will learn concrete steps that they can take to protect themselves before buying a bad coin, and how they can verify the coins that they have purchased online or elsewhere.    Other key presentations include:    +    A panel moderated by well-known author Scott Travers, where PCGS founder David Hall, Fox Business Network  journalist Jim Kingsland, and numismatic market analyst Maurice Rosen will discuss profiting from coins in a depressed economy.    +     Cherrypicker's Guide  co-author Bill Fivaz will teach you how to avoid buying commonly counterfeited coins.    +    Market expert and former ANA president Anthony Swiatek will tell us how to avoid being ripped off when we buy coins and currency from telemarketers and newspaper advertising.    As you can see, the FUN Show offers a great deal of entertainment and education, and you can't beat the price:  FREE!  So if you're in the Orlando area late this week,  don't miss it !    FUN in a Nutshell    Hours:   Thursday, Jan. 8th - 10:00 am to 6:30 pm  Friday, Jan. 9th - 10:00 am to 6:30 pm  Saturday, Jan 10th - 10:00 am to 6:30 pm  Sunday, Jan. 11th - 10:00 am to 3:00 pm   Location:   Orange County Convention Center  Hall NB, North Concourse  9400 Universal Blvd.  Orlando, Florida 32819   Additional information is available on the  FUN 2009 Web site .

clueweb09-enwp00-42-17691	"                     Numismatics          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Currency collecting )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about numismatics as an academic discipline.  For collecting, see  coin collecting .             Numismatics       Terminology     Portal       Currency       Coins ,  Banknotes ,   Forgery       Circulating currencies   Community currencies       Company scrip ,  LETS ,   Time dollars       Fictional currencies         Ancient currencies       Greek ,  Roman ,   Byzantine       Medieval currencies   Modern currencies       Africa ,  The Americas ,   Europe ,  Asia ,  Oceania             Production      Mint ,  Designers       Coining ,  Milling ,   Hammering ,  Cast             Exonumia       Credit cards ,  Medals ,   Tokens       Notaphily       Banknotes       Scripophily       Stocks ,  Bonds   v      d      e             Numismatics  ( Latin :  numisma, nomisma , ""coin""; from the  Greek :    nomzein , ""to use according to law"") is the study or collection of  currency , including coins, tokens, paper money, and related objects. While  numismatists  are often characterized as students or collectors of  coins , the discipline also includes a much larger study of  payment media used to resolve  debts  and the exchange of  goods . Lacking a structured  monetary system , people in the past as well as some today lived in a  barter  society and used locally-found items of inherent or implied value. Early money used by people is referred to as ""Odd and Curious"", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating  currency  (e.g.,  cigarettes  in prison). The  Kyrgyz  people used  horses  as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins. [ 1 ]  The  lambskins  may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horse is not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as  conch shells ,  precious metals  and  gems .   Today, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized or  credit  value. Numismatic value may be used to refer to the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law. This is also known as the ""collector's value"" or ""intrinsic value.""   Economic  and  historical  studies of money's use and development are separate to the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment (although the fields are related; economic theories of money's origin depend upon numismatics, for example).           Contents       1   History of money   2   History of numismatics     2.1   Modern numismatics   2.2   Subfields       3   Numismatists   4   See also   5   Notes               [ edit ]   History of money       Main article:  History of money       Money itself must be a  scarce  good. Many items have been used as money, from naturally scarce  precious metals  and  conch shells  through  cigarettes  to entirely artificial money such as  banknotes . Modern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token - an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today. However, goods such as  gold  or  silver  retain many of the essential properties of money.     [ edit ]   History of numismatics       A  Roman   denarius , a standardized  silver coin .       Coin Collecting may have existed in ancient times. Caesar  Augustus  gave ""coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money"" as  Saturnalia  gifts. [ 2 ]   Petrarch , who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first  Renaissance  collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to  Emperor Charles IV  in 1355.   The first book on coins was  De Asse et Partibus  (1514) by  Guillaume Bud . [ 3 ] . During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope  Boniface VIII , Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire,  Louis XIV  of France, Ferdinand I, Elector  Joachim II  of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and  Henry IV of France  to name a few. Numismatics is called the ""Hobby of Kings"", due to its most esteemed founders.   Professional societies organized in the 19th century. The  Royal Numismatic Society  was founded in 1836 and immediately begin publishing the journal that became the  Numismatic Chronicle . The  American Numismatic Society  was founded in 1858 and began publishing the  American Journal of Numismatics  in 1866.   In 1931 the  British Academy  launched the  Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum  publishing collections of  Ancient Greek coinage . The first volume of  Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles  was published in 1958.   In the 20th century as well the coins were seen more as archaeological objects. After  World War II  in Germany a project,  Fundmnzen der Antike  (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.   In the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. [ 4 ]  William E. Du Bois  Pledges of History...  (1846) describes the cabinet.   C. Wyllys Betts'  American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals  (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.     [ edit ]   Modern numismatics   Modern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid 17th to the 21st century, the period of machine struck coins. Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics lies frequently in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties,  mint-made errors , the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures and even the socio-political context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.     [ edit ]   Subfields       Main articles:  Exonumia ,  Notaphily , and  Scripophily       Exonumia  is the study of  coin -like objects such as  token coins  and  medals , and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes  elongated coins , encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counterstamped coins,  wooden nickels ,  credit cards , and other similar items. It is related to numismatics proper (concerned with coins which have been  legal tender ), and many  coin collectors  are also exonumists.   Notaphily  is the study of  paper money  or banknotes. It is believed that people have been collecting  paper money  for as long as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the  Serienscheine  (Series notes)  Notgeld . The turning point occurred in the 1970s, when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors. At the same time, some developed countries such as the  USA ,  Germany  and  France  began publishing their respective national catalogues of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.   Scripophily  is the study and collection of  stocks  and  Bonds . It is an interesting area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of  engraving . Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as a stock in a successor company.     [ edit ]   Numismatists   The term  numismatist  applies to collectors and coin dealers as well scholars using coins as source or studying coins.   The first group chiefly derive pleasure from the simple ownership of monetary devices and studying these coins as private amateur scholars. In the classical field amateur collector studies have achieved quite remarkable progress in the field. Examples are  Walter Breen , a well-known example of a noted numismatist who was not an avid collector, and King  Farouk I of Egypt  was an avid collector who had very little interest in numismatics. Harry Bass by comparison was a noted collector who was also a numismatist.   The second group are the coin dealers. These often called professional numismatists authenticate or  grade  coins for commercial purposes. The buying and selling of coin collections by numismatists who are professional dealers advances the study of money, and expert numismatists are consulted by historians, museum curators, and archaeologists.   The third category are scholar numismatists working in public collections, universities or as independent scholars acquiring knowledge about monetary devices, their systems, their economy and their historical context. Coins are especially relevant as source in the pre-modern period.     [ edit ]   See also         Look up  numismatics  in   Wiktionary , the free dictionary.

For collecting, see  coin collecting .   Numismatics  ( Latin :  numisma, nomisma , ""coin""; from the  Greek :    nomzein , ""to use according to law"") is the study or collection of  currency , including coins, tokens, paper money, and related objects. While  numismatists  are often characterized as students or collectors of  coins , the discipline also includes a much larger study of  payment media used to resolve  debts  and the exchange of  goods . Lacking a structured  monetary system , people in the past as well as some today lived in a  barter  society and used locally-found items of inherent or implied value. Early money used by people is referred to as ""Odd and Curious"", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating  currency  (e.g.,  cigarettes  in prison). The  Kyrgyz  people used  horses  as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins. [ 1 ]  The  lambskins  may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horse is not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as  conch shells ,  precious metals  and  gems .   Today, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized or  credit  value. Numismatic value may be used to refer to the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law. This is also known as the ""collector's value"" or ""intrinsic value.""   Economic  and  historical  studies of money's use and development are separate to the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment (although the fields are related; economic theories of money's origin depend upon numismatics, for example).

Many items have been used as money, from naturally scarce  precious metals  and  conch shells  through  cigarettes  to entirely artificial money such as  banknotes . Modern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token - an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today. However, goods such as  gold  or  silver  retain many of the essential properties of money.     [ edit ]   History of numismatics       A  Roman   denarius , a standardized  silver coin .       Coin Collecting may have existed in ancient times. Caesar  Augustus  gave ""coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money"" as  Saturnalia  gifts. [ 2 ]   Petrarch , who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first  Renaissance  collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to  Emperor Charles IV  in 1355.   The first book on coins was  De Asse et Partibus  (1514) by  Guillaume Bud . [ 3 ] . During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope  Boniface VIII , Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire,  Louis XIV  of France, Ferdinand I, Elector  Joachim II  of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and  Henry IV of France  to name a few. Numismatics is called the ""Hobby of Kings"", due to its most esteemed founders.   Professional societies organized in the 19th century. The  Royal Numismatic Society  was founded in 1836 and immediately begin publishing the journal that became the  Numismatic Chronicle . The  American Numismatic Society  was founded in 1858 and began publishing the  American Journal of Numismatics  in 1866.   In 1931 the  British Academy  launched the  Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum  publishing collections of  Ancient Greek coinage . The first volume of  Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles  was published in 1958.   In the 20th century as well the coins were seen more as archaeological objects. After  World War II  in Germany a project,  Fundmnzen der Antike  (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.   In the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. [ 4 ]  William E.

[ edit ]   Numismatists   The term  numismatist  applies to collectors and coin dealers as well scholars using coins as source or studying coins.

In the classical field amateur collector studies have achieved quite remarkable progress in the field. Examples are  Walter Breen , a well-known example of a noted numismatist who was not an avid collector, and King  Farouk I of Egypt  was an avid collector who had very little interest in numismatics. Harry Bass by comparison was a noted collector who was also a numismatist.   The second group are the coin dealers. These often called professional numismatists authenticate or  grade  coins for commercial purposes. The buying and selling of coin collections by numismatists who are professional dealers advances the study of money, and expert numismatists are consulted by historians, museum curators, and archaeologists.   The third category are scholar numismatists working in public collections, universities or as independent scholars acquiring knowledge about monetary devices, their systems, their economy and their historical context. Coins are especially relevant as source in the pre-modern period.     [ edit ]   See also         Look up  numismatics  in   Wiktionary , the free dictionary.

While  numismatists  are often characterized as students or collectors of  coins , the discipline also includes a much larger study of  payment media used to resolve  debts  and the exchange of  goods . Lacking a structured  monetary system , people in the past as well as some today lived in a  barter  society and used locally-found items of inherent or implied value. Early money used by people is referred to as ""Odd and Curious"", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating  currency  (e.g.,  cigarettes  in prison). The  Kyrgyz  people used  horses  as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins. [ 1 ]  The  lambskins  may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horse is not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as  conch shells ,  precious metals  and  gems .   Today, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized or  credit  value. Numismatic value may be used to refer to the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law. This is also known as the ""collector's value"" or ""intrinsic value.""   Economic  and  historical  studies of money's use and development are separate to the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment (although the fields are related; economic theories of money's origin depend upon numismatics, for example).

Many items have been used as money, from naturally scarce  precious metals  and  conch shells  through  cigarettes  to entirely artificial money such as  banknotes . Modern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token - an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today. However, goods such as  gold  or  silver  retain many of the essential properties of money.     [ edit ]   History of numismatics       A  Roman   denarius , a standardized  silver coin .       Coin Collecting may have existed in ancient times. Caesar  Augustus  gave ""coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money"" as  Saturnalia  gifts. [ 2 ]   Petrarch , who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first  Renaissance  collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to  Emperor Charles IV  in 1355.   The first book on coins was  De Asse et Partibus  (1514) by  Guillaume Bud . [ 3 ] . During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope  Boniface VIII , Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire,  Louis XIV  of France, Ferdinand I, Elector  Joachim II  of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and  Henry IV of France  to name a few. Numismatics is called the ""Hobby of Kings"", due to its most esteemed founders.   Professional societies organized in the 19th century. The  Royal Numismatic Society  was founded in 1836 and immediately begin publishing the journal that became the  Numismatic Chronicle . The  American Numismatic Society  was founded in 1858 and began publishing the  American Journal of Numismatics  in 1866.   In 1931 the  British Academy  launched the  Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum  publishing collections of  Ancient Greek coinage . The first volume of  Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles  was published in 1958.   In the 20th century as well the coins were seen more as archaeological objects. After  World War II  in Germany a project,  Fundmnzen der Antike  (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.   In the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. [ 4 ]  William E. Du Bois  Pledges of History...  (1846) describes the cabinet.   C.

For collecting, see  coin collecting .   Numismatics  ( Latin :  numisma, nomisma , ""coin""; from the  Greek :    nomzein , ""to use according to law"") is the study or collection of  currency , including coins, tokens, paper money, and related objects. While  numismatists  are often characterized as students or collectors of  coins , the discipline also includes a much larger study of  payment media used to resolve  debts  and the exchange of  goods . Lacking a structured  monetary system , people in the past as well as some today lived in a  barter  society and used locally-found items of inherent or implied value. Early money used by people is referred to as ""Odd and Curious"", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating  currency  (e.g.,  cigarettes  in prison). The  Kyrgyz  people used  horses  as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins. [ 1 ]  The  lambskins  may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horse is not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as  conch shells ,  precious metals  and  gems .   Today, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized or  credit  value. Numismatic value may be used to refer to the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law. This is also known as the ""collector's value"" or ""intrinsic value.""   Economic  and  historical  studies of money's use and development are separate to the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment (although the fields are related; economic theories of money's origin depend upon numismatics, for example).

Many items have been used as money, from naturally scarce  precious metals  and  conch shells  through  cigarettes  to entirely artificial money such as  banknotes . Modern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token - an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today. However, goods such as  gold  or  silver  retain many of the essential properties of money.     [ edit ]   History of numismatics       A  Roman   denarius , a standardized  silver coin .       Coin Collecting may have existed in ancient times. Caesar  Augustus  gave ""coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money"" as  Saturnalia  gifts. [ 2 ]   Petrarch , who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first  Renaissance  collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to  Emperor Charles IV  in 1355.   The first book on coins was  De Asse et Partibus  (1514) by  Guillaume Bud . [ 3 ] . During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope  Boniface VIII , Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire,  Louis XIV  of France, Ferdinand I, Elector  Joachim II  of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and  Henry IV of France  to name a few. Numismatics is called the ""Hobby of Kings"", due to its most esteemed founders.   Professional societies organized in the 19th century. The  Royal Numismatic Society  was founded in 1836 and immediately begin publishing the journal that became the  Numismatic Chronicle . The  American Numismatic Society  was founded in 1858 and began publishing the  American Journal of Numismatics  in 1866.   In 1931 the  British Academy  launched the  Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum  publishing collections of  Ancient Greek coinage . The first volume of  Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles  was published in 1958.   In the 20th century as well the coins were seen more as archaeological objects. After  World War II  in Germany a project,  Fundmnzen der Antike  (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.   In the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. [ 4 ]  William E. Du Bois  Pledges of History...  (1846) describes the cabinet.   C. Wyllys Betts'  American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals  (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.     [ edit ]   Modern numismatics   Modern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid 17th to the 21st century, the period of machine struck coins. Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics lies frequently in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties,  mint-made errors , the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures and even the socio-political context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.     [ edit ]   Subfields       Main articles:  Exonumia ,  Notaphily , and  Scripophily       Exonumia  is the study of  coin -like objects such as  token coins  and  medals , and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes  elongated coins , encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counterstamped coins,  wooden nickels ,  credit cards , and other similar items. It is related to numismatics proper (concerned with coins which have been  legal tender ), and many  coin collectors  are also exonumists.   Notaphily  is the study of  paper money  or banknotes. It is believed that people have been collecting  paper money  for as long as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the  Serienscheine  (Series notes)  Notgeld . The turning point occurred in the 1970s, when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors. At the same time, some developed countries such as the  USA ,  Germany  and  France  began publishing their respective national catalogues of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.   Scripophily  is the study and collection of  stocks  and  Bonds . It is an interesting area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of  engraving . Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as a stock in a successor company.     [ edit ]   Numismatists   The term  numismatist  applies to collectors and coin dealers as well scholars using coins as source or studying coins.   The first group chiefly derive pleasure from the simple ownership of monetary devices and studying these coins as private amateur scholars. In the classical field amateur collector studies have achieved quite remarkable progress in the field. Examples are  Walter Breen , a well-known example of a noted numismatist who was not an avid collector, and King  Farouk I of Egypt  was an avid collector who had very little interest in numismatics. Harry Bass by comparison was a noted collector who was also a numismatist.   The second group are the coin dealers. These often called professional numismatists authenticate or  grade  coins for commercial purposes. The buying and selling of coin collections by numismatists who are professional dealers advances the study of money, and expert numismatists are consulted by historians, museum curators, and archaeologists.   The third category are scholar numismatists working in public collections, universities or as independent scholars acquiring knowledge about monetary devices, their systems, their economy and their historical context. Coins are especially relevant as source in the pre-modern period.     [ edit ]   See also         Look up  numismatics  in   Wiktionary , the free dictionary.

As a general matter, the rarer a coin the higher the coin value. Note that rarity has little to do with the age of a coin. Many one thousand year old Chinese coins often sell for no more than a few dollars because there are a lot of them around, whereas a 1913 Liberty Head Nickel may sell for over $1,000,000 because there are only five known specimens in existence.                      The condition or grade  will influence coin value.                        The better the condition a coin is in, the higher will be its assigned grade and the more it will be worth. An uncirculated coin that is in flawless mint state might be worth hundreds times more than the same coin in good condition but which has been circulated.                        Please refer to the  Coin Grading  page for more information about coin grades.                      Gold Coin Values ,  Silver Coin Values  : Many coins have a  bullion value  determined by the value of the precious metals it contains. A gold coins, silver coins or platinum coin does not generally sell for much less than its melt value.                      The demand  for the particular coin, or how many collectors want it, will also greatly influence coin values. Some coins that are relatively plentiful may command higher prices than scarcer coins because the former are more popular with collectors. For example, there are over 400,000 1916 D dimes in existence as compared to only about 30,000 1798 dimes. However, even though the 1798 dime is much rarer than its 1916D counterpart, the 1916D coin sells for significantly more. This is because many more people collect early 20th century mercury dimes than dimes from the 1700's.                       Rarity and grade do not tell the whole story in a coin's value. The "" quality "" of coins is a huge factor in determining coin value and coin price when you decide to sell. But it is also the most difficult to determine properly, and requires a practiced eye.                       Obviously, all coins are not all the same aesthetically. Some coin designs -- the high relief Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle, for example -- are widely considered to be more beautiful than others. The public's taste for these designs has a significant influence on the value of the coins that bear them.                       But when we speak of a coin's ""quality,"" we are talking about characteristics of minting, execution, survival condition, and overall eye appeal that set it apart from other coins of the same design and certified grade. Individual coins that are above average in appearance for strike, luster, evenness and/or color of toning, and eye appeal are considered to be higher in quality, and simply in greater demand, than those that do not look as nice-even at the same PCGS or NGC rating. The higher the quality, the greater the value of any particular issue.                       Furthermore, some coins grade at the top of their rating while others grade at the bottom, even though they are identical on paper. These differences within grade are usually small but nonetheless observable to the expert eye, and are an important factor in quality and value. Coins that are higher in quality always sell faster and usually command higher prices than other coins at each grade rating. The quality of your rare coins is therefore is quite important, not merely for your own aesthetic enjoyment but also for the value and liquidity of your investment.                     Finding a reputable  coin dealer  can help you determine the true value of the coins in your collection. Make sure you research the coin dealer on the internet to make sure you're dealing with a quality buyer.

The current  flag of the Republic of  South Africa  was adopted on  April 27 ,  1994 , during the  1994 general election . A new  national flag  was adopted to represent the new democracy.   None of the flag designs submitted by the public was supported by the committee charged to select the final design. An interim flag was designed by  State Herald   Frederick Brownell  for the  April 27  elections, the nation's first fully inclusive elections, and for  Nelson Mandela 's  May 10  inauguration. Although the flag had mixed reception, the interim version was made the final, national flag in the  South African Constitution . The new flag is seen as an enduring symbol of the modern South African state.   The flag has horizontal bands of  red  (on the top) and  blue  (on the bottom), of equal width, separated by a central  green  band which splits into a horizontal ""Y"" shape, the arms of which end at the corners of the hoist side (and follow the flag's diagonals). The Y embraces a  black   isosceles triangle  from which the arms are separated by narrow  yellow  bands; the red and blue bands are separated from the green band and its arms by narrow  white  stripes. The stripes at the fly end are in the 5:1:3:1:5 ratio. The South African flag is the only national flag in the world with six colours and without a  seal  or  brocade . In  blazons  (a  vexillological  description using  flag terminology ), the South African flag is described as ""per  pall   fesswise   gules ,  sable  and  azure , a fesswise pall  vert   fimbriated   argent ,  Or  and argent.""

However, according to Brownell, the flag's designer, the red symbolises the blood shed in the country's various conflicts and wars. [ citation needed ]          Construction sheet (click to enlarge).       Unofficial explanations have been suggested for the meaning of the flag's colours. In one optimistic explanation, the  pall  (Y) is stated to symbolise the convergence as one unified nation, the blue represents the sky and the two oceans that surround the country, the green symbolises the farms and natural environment that are an essential part of South Africa, the yellow stands for the natural resources of South Africa, particularly  gold , the black represents black South Africans, doubling as a symbol of belonging with the rest of Africa, and the white represents white South Africans, doubling as a symbol of peace.   There are also cynical or humorous explanations, such as the idea that the yellow represents an electric fence, separating black from white. The flag has a few nicknames as well, such as the Winnie Mandela G-string [ 2 ]  and Y-fronts (male underpants) [ 3 ]   Three of the colours  black, green and yellow  are found in the flag of the  African National Congress . The other three  red, white and blue  are used in the  flag of the Netherlands  and the  flag of the United Kingdom ; these colours were also found in the old flag of South Africa, although with orange instead of red. The orange represented the orange, white and blue flag of the Dutch House of the Prince of Orange. The flag could thus be interpreted as a display of unity between the two South African traditions, or more pessimistically, as a compromise between black and white South Africans. Red, yellow and green are also the  Pan-African colours .

South Africa's national flag, ""Prinsevlag"", 1928-1994. Ratio: 2:3       After the  Anglo-Boer War  from 1899 to 1902 and the formation of the  Union of South Africa  in 1910, the  British   Union Flag  became the national flag of South Africa. As was the case throughout the  British Empire , the  Red  and  Blue Ensign  with the Union coat of arms were granted by British Admiralty warrants in 1910 for use at sea.   These ensigns were not intended to be used as the Union's national flag, although they were used by some people as such, especially the Red Ensign. It was only after the first post-Union  Afrikaner  government took office in 1925 that a bill was introduced in  Parliament  to make provisions for a national flag for the Union; this action immediately prompted three years of near  civil war , [ citation needed ]  as the British thought that the  Boers  wanted to remove their cherished imperial symbols.  Natal Province  even threatened to  secede  from the Union.   Finally, a compromise was reached that resulted in the adoption of a separate flag for the Union in late 1927, and the design was first hoisted on  31 May   1928 . The design was based on the so-called Van Riebeeck flag or  Prinsevlag  (""Prince's flag"" in  Afrikaans ) which was originally the  Dutch flag , and consisted of orange, white, and blue horizontal stripes. A version of this flag was used as the flag of the  Dutch East India Company  at the Cape (with the VOC logo in the centre) from 1652 until 1795. The South African addition to the design was three smaller flags centred in the white stripe. The smaller flags were the Union Flag towards the hoist, the  Orange Free State   Vierkleur  hanging vertically and the  Transvaal   Vierkleur  towards the fly.   The choice of the Prinsevlag as the basis upon which to design the South African flag had more to do with compromise than Afrikaner political desires, as the Prinsevlag was believed to be the first flag hoisted on South African soil and was politically neutral as it was no longer the national flag of any nation. A further element of this compromise was that the Union Flag would continue to fly alongside the new South African national flag over official buildings. This state of duality continued until 1957 when the Union Flag lost its official status as per an  Act of Parliament ; the Red Ensign had lost its status as South Africa's  merchant flag  in 1951.   Following a  referendum , the country became a  republic  on  31 May   1961 , but the design of the flag remained unchanged. However, there was intense pressure to change the flag, particularly from Afrikaners who resented the fact that the Union Flag was a part of the flag.   The former  Prime Minister  and architect of  apartheid ,  Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd , had a dream to hoist a ""clean"" flag over South Africa in the 1960s. The proposed design comprised three vertical stripes of the same colour of the Prinsevlag with a leaping  Springbok Antelope  over a  wreath  of six  proteas  in the centre. H.C. Blatt, then assistant secretary in the Department of the Prime Minister, designed the flag. Verwoerd's successor,  John Vorster , raised the flag issue at a  news conference  on  30 March   1971  and said that in light of the impending 10th anniversary Republic Day celebrations, he preferred to ""keep the affair in the background"". This he said was done because he did not want the flag question to degenerate into a  political football , as happened in the 1920s over the Union Flag, and that the matter would be considered again when circumstances would be ""more normal"". He also went on to say that ""I only want to warn, and express hope, that no person should drag politics in any form into this matter, because the flag must, at all times, be raised above party politics in South Africa"".   Despite the flag's origins predating the  National Party 's ascension to power, the presence of the  three little flags in the middle  was internationally perceived as being an implied endorsement of apartheid. [ citation needed ]  In this light it is possible to theorise that the end of apartheid may not have beckoned a change in national flag if a more neutral one had indeed been selected in the 1960s, or perhaps even if the three subflags had been merely excised before the Prinsevlag became the inadvertent symbol of apartheid it did.     [ edit ]   Current design          The flag flies at the  SCG       The present design of the South African national flag was first flown on  27 April   1994 . However, the flag was first commissioned as an interim flag only, and was decided upon at the very last minute, barely making it onto the nation's flagpoles in time for the election.   The choice of a new flag was part of the negotiation process set in motion when  Nelson Mandela  was released from prison in 1990. When a nationwide public competition was held in 1993, the National Symbols Commission received more than 7,000 designs. Six designs were drawn up and presented to the public and the Negotiating Council, but none elicited enthusiastic support. A number of design studios were contacted to submit further proposals, but they were again without success.  Parliament  went into  recess  at the end of 1993 without a suitable candidate for the new national flag.   In February 1994,  Cyril Ramaphosa  and  Roelf Meyer , chief negotiators of the  African National Congress  and the  National Party  government of the day respectively, were given the task of resolving the flag issue. A final design was adopted on  15 March   1994 , derived from a design developed by  Frederick Brownell  who had also designed the  Flag of Namibia . The proclamation of the new national flag was only published on  20 April   1994 , a mere seven days before the flag was to be inaugurated, sparking a frantic last-minute flurry for flag manufacturers. As stated in South Africa's post-apartheid interim constitution, the flag was to be introduced on an interim probationary period of five years, after which there would be discussion about whether or not to change the national flag in the  final draft of the constitution . However, the flag was very well received and was included in the final draft without much debate.     [ edit ]   Proper display of the flag     [ edit ]   Respect for the flag   South African law says that the flag must at all times be treated with "" dignity  and  respect "".  Regulations Regarding the Flying of the National Flag , published just before the flag was adopted in 1994, indicates the rules for the display of the flag. Official regulation states that the flag must never touch the ground or floor, be used as a table cloth or draped in front of a platform, cover a  statue , plaque, cornerstone etc. at unveiling or similar ceremonies, start or finish any competition,  race  or similar event, be manufactured or used as  underclothes , bath and floor mats or any similar demeaning application, or be used for any commercial  advertising  in a manner that will distort or show disrespect to the flag.   To manufacture or reproduce the flag in any manner requires permission from the President of South Africa.   Despite these rules, the new flag has in essence become 'public property', and it would seem that many South Africans are unaware of the fact that rules of respect that had applied to the previous flag also apply to the current flag. The current flag is regularly seen painted on faces during sports events, and 'cut into pieces' for clothing and other uses.     [ edit ]   Traditional rules for handling the flag   There are a number of traditional rules of respect that should be observed when handling or displaying the flag. Officially observed traditions state that the flag should always be hoisted at the start of the working day and lowered again before or at  sunset . It is not to remain flying at night unless suitably  illuminated . In South Africa, this rule still applies to government-designated flag stations, while through common usage the flag can be displayed 24 hours a day outside of official stations. The flag should also be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously. Furthermore, whenever a person sees an official flag hoisting or lowering ceremony in progress, he or she should come to a halt and stand respectfully to attention for the duration. If a  hat  is worn, it should be removed, and the right hand should be placed over the heart in  salute . Persons in  uniform  should salute in the manner prescribed by their service. The flag should never be depicted, displayed or flown upside down. Flying a flag upside down is the traditional sign of  distress . When displayed horizontally, the black triangle should be to your left and the red band uppermost.     Tradition also states that when draped  vertically , a flag should not merely be rotated through 90  degrees , but also reversed. In the case of the South African flag, the black triangle must be uppermost and the red band on the left. One ""reads"" a flag like the pages of a book, from top to bottom and from left to right, and after rotation the results should be the same. It is also insulting to display the flag in a frayed or dirty state. The same rule applies to the flagpoles and halyards used to hoist the flag  they should always be in a proper state of maintenance. The flag may never be defaced by placing  slogans  or any writing or design directly on the field of the flag.    [ edit ]   Correct display of the flag   The rules regarding the correct methods to display the flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their  hoists  should be towards each other with the red stripes uppermost, and if the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted at an  angle  to the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables,  lecterns  or  podiums , or be draped from railings.       [ edit ]   Showing the flag with other countries' flags   When the National Flag is flown outdoors in company with the national flags of other countries, there are several rules that govern the ways in which the flag must be flown; specifically, that it must always occupy the position of honour. This means it must be the flag furthest to the right (observers' left) of all the flags on display, with the flags of other countries being arranged  alphabetically , and that all the flags should be approximately the same size, with no flags being larger than the South African flag. Each country's flag should be on a separate pole, with no national flag being flown on top of another from the same pole. The South African flag must always be hoisted first and lowered last, and if the South African flag is displayed on crossed poles, the South African flag's pole should be in front and the flag to the right (observers' left) of the other flag.       [ edit ]   Showing the flag indoors   Whenever the flag is displayed indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it should always be on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in a hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand; when displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be to the right of the  audience .   The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the red stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the red stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.       [ edit ]   Parades and ceremonies   The flag, when carried in a procession or  parade  or with another flag or flags, should be on the marching right or alone in front in the centre. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be  dipped  to a person or thing. Regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags may be dipped as a mark of honour.     During a ceremony where the flag is hoisted or lowered, or when the flag is passing in a parade, all persons present, except for those in uniform, should face the flag while standing at attention with the right hand over the heart. Hats should be removed and held in the right hand at the left shoulder with the hand over the heart. Those present in uniform should  salute . The same rules apply when the  national anthem  is played.     [ edit ]   Half mast   The flag should be flown at  half mast  as a sign of  mourning  only on instructions from the president, who will also give a date ending the mourning period. When the flag is to be flown at half mast, it must first be raised to the top of the mast and then slowly lowered to half mast. Before being lowered at sunset or at the appropriate time, the flag is first raised to the top of the pole and then lowered. Only the South African flag is flown half mast; all other flags remain at normal height.     [ edit ]   Disposal   When no longer in a fit condition to be used, a flag should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by burning.     [ edit ]   Heraldic description   An addendum to the Transitional Executive Council agenda (April 1994) described the flag in heraldic terms as follows:   The National flag shall be rectangular in the proportion of two in the width to three to the length; per pall from the hoist, the upper band red (chilli) and lower band blue, with a black triangle at the hoist; over the partition lines a green pall one fifth the width of the flag, fimbriated white against the red and blue, and gold against the black triangle at the hoist, and the width of the pall and its fimbriations is one third the width of the flag.   Schedule One of the Constitution of South Africa (1996) replaced the heraldic definition and described the flag in plain English as follows:   The national flag is rectangular; it is one and a half times longer than it is wide.     It is black, gold, green, white, chilli red and blue.   It has a green Y-shaped band that is one fifth as wide as the flag. The centre lines of the band start in the top and bottom corners next to the flag post, converge in the centre of the flag, and continue horizontally to the middle of the free edge.   The green band is edged, above and below in white, and towards the flag post end, in gold. Each edging is one fifteenth as wide as the flag.   The triangle next to the flag post is black.   The upper horizontal band is chilli red and the lower horizontal band is blue. These bands are each one third as wide as the flag.

Getting organized is a priority on your list as your scrapbooking supplies expand and grow over time. Ever scratched your head and asked yourself, ""I remember seeing that mauve-colored Gel Roll somewhere... But where?""  ""There must be another cardstock I've put away that matches this paper. But I can't seem to find it now when I need it!"".  ""Aagrh! I've been searching for one whole hour for that missing daisy quilled-sticker. It's driving me nuts!!"" Save yourself this kind of agony. Better to start early with scrapbooking organization rather than when the clutter amounts to scary proportions.  Organizing your zillions of supplies is a necessity, not a want. Can you imagine how frustrating it can be when you intend to spend time working on your scrapbooking pages, but get bogged down with searching this and that?  You may want to pay some attention to your scrapbooking organization right away. Starting early will help you save more time later.    Giving Time to Getting Organized  Scrapbooking organization can be broken down into simple and manageable steps.  Just that you have to set aside some time to doing it. It's usually not as time-consuming as you think. If you set aside too big a time frame to getting your scrapbooking organization done, it'll appear overwhelming and you'll keep procrastinating this important task. A practical time frame will get you started quickly.  That said, you'll love it when your  scrapbooking organization  is all done up. Just imagine the immense sense of satisfaction and pride welling up in you. Best of all, you can now find whatever you need in a nifty. :-) A Scrapbooker's Guide: Organizing your Tools and Workspace (E-Book) OK, if you need expert guidance on getting your scrapspace, scraproom, or scrapbooking life into an organized haven, here's one e-Book you might like. It shows you how to keep your cardstock, embellishments, albums, tools, pens, etc into clear organization. It helps you to create a space that's a reflection of your style.  No matter how big or small your scrapspace is, you'll be inspired and go away with great ideas from Jill Davis, the founder of Scrapbook.com. You'll get sneak previews into her personal scrap studio too.    Steps to Getting Organized  Six steps to making scrapbooking organization successful: 1)  Sorting You'll probably need a large floor space if your have a huge collection of supplies. To see everything at a glance, spread them all out on the floor. Sort according to categories like papers, brad, eyelets, tags, stickers, punch art, etc. If you desire, you can also sort within categories. How about sorting your stacks of papers into different families of colors? Or your hundreds of eyelets into various colors? Your brads into different shapes? Sort according to what you think work best for you.  2)  Recycling   Be a little hard-hearted and get rid of those supplies that you won't need, once and for all. Sometimes it's kinda tough for you to look at those yesteryear stickers and convince yourself that you'll use it someday. The thing is, you probably won't need it and it's taking up precious space.  Clearing away those items you don't need will make space for your new supplies. Isn't that more fun?  Furthermore, your old supplies can have a chance at a new life as another scrapbooker's treasure. Hint: organize a swap with your friends or cropping buddies.  Get a box and fill it up with items that you wanna donate or give them away. Doesn't it make you feel good when you can give away something that others might love?  3)  Allocating   Set up a space for your scrapbooking activity. It may be a closet, a corner at your house or if you're lucky enough, a whole room to yourself. Whatever the space, designate it as your scrapbooking corner.  After sorting through all your supplies, now it's the time to consider where to house them.  One consideration is how often do you use these supplies? Place frequently-used items close to where you work, and you may put aside those seldom-used items to another part of your room.    4)  Containerizing Now it's the time to pour your supplies into their homes that you've chosen for them.  See how prettily the various containers are filling up with your supplies. Do you feel your sense of satisfaction growing? 5)  Labeling Print or neatly handwrite labels for your containers, drawers, shelves, etc.  With your supplies in their homes and labels pointing out their exact locations to you, searching for your supplies is now a breeze.  6)  Maintaining Give yourself a pat on your shoulder for completing such an important and big task of scrapbooking organization! Now that you're done, the last thing you want to do is to mess it all up again.  To avoid this, spend 5-10 minutes after each scrapbooking session and put back each item to its place.  This habit will help you maintain a neat and tidy scrapbooking haven.

Alot has been going on in my personal life and keeping up with everything has been difficult. I’m trying to get things back on track. I will be reviewing all of our wholesale applications we have received, as well as applications for Sales Representatives.   We are working on redesigning all of our Scrapbook Kits. Each kit contained die cuts and just about everything you needed to create beautiful scrapbook pages. Now we are going to be offering our kits with more papers, more embellishments, and we will be omitting the die cuts. Our reason for omitting the die cut titles is because so many have requested our kits to be generalized. In addition we have been having difficulties with our die cut machine behaving properly. Once our kits are complete we will upload the new photos showing the full contents of the kits with complete description of each kit. We are sure that you will enjoy the revised products.

I keep everything organized and even my junk drawer is organized right down to the last  rubber band!    My desk is organized right down to the last pen. I’m going to be posting articles about getting organized for the next several posts. I am hoping that my articles will inspire you to get more organized so you have more time to yourself for the fun things you enjoy!   First I’ll give you a little ‘run down’ on how my files system and backup system is over here.  I have several hard drives, even external hard drives and a backup server! Why do I need all this space? You will find out why very soon   I have three physical hard drives in my computer. The first one contains the C drive, D which is my windows 98, E which I have for software only. Your computer will run smoother if you have your software on a separate partition. Keeping the C drive for important system software such as your anti virus.  I have a separate partition for each category in your business. I even have one for ‘Downloads’.  I have a ‘Projects’ partition for current projects and documents that have not yet been saved. I have two backup drives, a master file drive where I keep all my files for when orders are placed I don’t have to go searching in folders for the zips for customers. Most of our files are readily downloadable from the website once customers make their purchase, but I still keep   them in a separate partition on my computer. I have a partition for each and every category of products we have. Why? Because I like to keep my files organized and easily accessible. I dont like to spend hours trying to find something.   Let’s start getting you organized by starting with your computer. It’s important to keep your computer organized so you can find your documents quickly and efficiently. Everyone has important documents that can not be lost. I never store anything on my C drive, nor do I put anything on the same partition as C.  First you need a completely different hard drive than your C drive to keep your documents, project files, and business documents. I can’t stress enough on how important this is to keep your work OFF the C drive and OFF that partition. Let’s face it, windows crashes when you least expect it to and if you are unable to reboot, you have just lost everything sitting on that C drive! If you have any work on it now, move that first.  I know what you’re thinking right now and your documents and files are not safe on CDs.  CDs eventually go bad and can no longer be read. Yeah, you better start grabbing that stack of CDs and start putting those files back onto your computer!   First let’s start with drives. You should have a 4-6 gig drive named “Projects”. The projects drive is where you will keep all files that you are currently working on and have not yet backed up. Your next drive you should have is a very large drive named “Backups”. The backup drive is where you will ‘COPY’ all of your project files. When making a backup you should create a folder and name it the exact date you are making the copied files, something like this 2008-0208′. Then you can make a CD or DVD backup for extra storage. But NEVER remove the files from your computer. After you have created both backups, verify the data is all there. Once the data is verified it is safe to MOVE the data to its appropriate location. Such as if it is a logo you created for someone move it to the partition named Custom Design or Custom Logos. I backup my files in 2 locations, one on my Backup drive, and one on my Server. My server holds every single file I have ever created and it is the largest backup system I have.   Now, to get your categories organized. Lets use my scrapbook projects as an example. Within the Scrapbook drive I have folders named exactly with my product names. We have embellishments we make by hand and that folder is named Scrappy Doodles because that is the name of our product. Within that folder is numbered, 001-Panda-Balloons and so on. Each time I create a new embellishment, I put all files associated with that item into that particular folder. When I create a label for the package, that goes into that folder as well. Anything that doesnt belong, is NOT in that folder.   If you use this method of organization for your computer you will find that you will be able to locate your documents quickly and efficiently. And you will be able to complete your orders in minimal time! I hope this article helps you get better organized.                                « Previous Entries                         © 2009 Scrappy Blog  |  Entries (RSS)  and  Comments (RSS)    Powered by  Wordpress , design by Web4  Sudoku , based on Pinkline by  GPS  Gazette             
clueweb09-en0000-24-08147	"                                                  The Scrapbooking.com Library Archive    Please go to  Scrapbooking.com                        to see the current issue of Scrapbooking.com online                       magazine           Workshop Tips                   July 1998 Workshop Tips               You'll find the basic tips below, but I wanted to add a few tips     that take advantage of some of the new products on the market. To make your pens     last longer, store them horizontally.  The Cropper Hopper Case or Cropper Hopper 12 x     12 Storage Case are perfect for storing your scrapbooking pens for easy access.       Reclaim lost time by getting organized. When you are waiting for the doctor, dentist,     carpool or even during soccer practice, you can put away your photos and sort through your     recently developed photos for the best shots. Just bring your Cropper Hopper Photo Storage     Case with so that you will be organized and ready for your next crop.       Getting Stuck? Reclaim lost time by getting organized. When you are waiting for the     doctor, dentist, carpool or even during soccer practice, you can put away your recently     purchased stickers  so that you can find the QUICK!  Just bring your Cropper     Hopper Sticker Organizer with you and you can be organized and ready for your next crop.       Use your workshop time to its BEST advantage by getting organized BEFORE the workshop.     When you are waiting for the doctor, dentist, carpool or even during soccer practice, you     can preview the page layouts that you will be doing next to see if you need any supplies-     if you do need supplies, make a list so that you remember what you need. The Cropper     Hopper Class Tote is a great place to store your supplies as you layout pages. Use the     hanging folders to hold the photos and supplies that you'll need to complete the layout as     you assemble everything. When you have everything you need take the Class Tote to your     next crop.       Do you wish that your handwriting looked better? Use bits and pieces of time to     practice your handwriting. When you are watching TV,  waiting for the doctor,     dentist, carpool or even during soccer practice, you can get out a handwriting book, some     paper and your scrapbooking pens to practice your lettering. If you use a  Cropper     Hopper Case to store your lettering book, paper and your pens, you'll be ready to practice     whenever you have a few minutes.       Do you want to make the most of your ""workshop time"".  Use bits and     pieces of time before the workshop to do some prep work. When you are watching TV,        waiting for the doctor, dentist, carpool or even during soccer practice, you     can crop photos, mat photos and plan your layouts.  If you keep your paper trimmer     and circle cutter in a Cropper Hopper Supply Bin inside a Cropper Hopper Class Tote,     you'll be ready to ""crop on-the-go"".       Do you love punch art, but don't' feel like you have the time?  When you are     waiting for the doctor, dentist, carpool or even during soccer practice, you can pre-punch     your shapes and start creating the punch art. If you keep your basic punches, adhesive,     punch art book and paper in a Cropper Hopper Case, you'll be ready to get creative     whenever you have a few minutes. Then assemble your pre-planned pages you the next     workshop you attend.       Vacationing this summer? Do your journalizing as your go. Take acid free/ lignin free     paper and your scrapbooking pens with you on the road. Journal every night before you go     to bed. When you return you can copy your notes onto your scrapbook pages or simply put     the journal notes right into your album. The Cropper Hopper Case or 12 X 12 Storage Case     will hold your supplies and also act as a table for your journalizing.       Got years of photos to sort through? Collect them all in one place first. Be sure to     dig in all of your drawers and old photo albums. Check with relatives for copies of photos     that you might want in your albums. Do not forget to check the framed photos around your     house- do you need to make copies of them before they fade? Take you time to collect all     the photos, it may take a few weeks. After they are all assembled, place them in     alphabetical order. The Cropper Hopper Photo Storage case holds over 2000  of your 4     X 6 photos and will help you get those photos organized so you can start scrapbooking.       Frequent croppers will love the Cropper Hopper Jr. due out this summer and the Crop In     Style or Crop In Style XL for getting their supplies to the crop. for those who     attend regular crops and workshops, keeping your supplies packed at all times will speed     up your preparation time for workshops and make the cost of a scrapbooking     ""tote"" worthwhile.       Label your supplies before attending a crop. Take a few minutes and place a sticker on     each item, or label with a Sharpie. Some scrapbookers use ribbon to mark the handles of     their scissors.       Highsmith makes some great acid free page keepers that are sized for 8 1/2 by 11 inch     pages or 12 x 12 inch pages. I use them to carry pages in progress and extra paper to     workshops.                       Workshop Tips 1997               So, you'll be scrapbooking away from home in the future. What you     want to take with you will depend if you are going but here are a few basic tips.     PREPARING BEFORE YOU LEAVE:          Presort your photos and place the photos that you will use in an         envelope (acid free envelopes are available and may be used over and over again for this         purpose) Label the outside of the envelope with the date and event using a pencil.         Take a few minutes and think about the layout you will be doing with         the photos from each event. If you decide what color paper will look good with the photos,         or what photos you will be using in advance it will help you save time at the workshop you         are attending.         Place the photos and the supplies you anticipate using into a hanging         file folder.         Try to only pack what you will need, but remember you probably will         not have a scrapbooking store close by.             WHAT TOOLS TO TAKE:          Personal Paper Trimmer- I like Fiskars brand trimmer         A nice sharp pair of scissors         One favorite pair of decorative scissors- I like the Family Treasures         long blade Deckle         Take one or more adhesives- for paper and die cuts I like Mono         Adhesive roll on adhesive         A supply of paper in colors that coordinate with the layouts you have         planned             WHAT TO PACK IT ALL IN- this depends on how many goodies you are     taking with you         For a light load, take a file box with a built in handle. Rubbermaid         and several other manufacturers make inexpensive models of these. You may already have one         at home, just take it over for scrapbooking during your vacation.         If you have a larger number of supplies try the Omni Box by Sterlite.         This looks like a plastic milk crate. There is an office version that comes with hanging         file folders and a lid or a plain version with no lid. Either one will hold hanging         folders filled with supplies, a 12 x 12 album and some of your tools.

FREE updates and maintenance each year to any of your existing web pages. This includes updated text and photos. There is no limitation to the number of updates and changes. After we have spent the 2 hours of free time, you may choose our maintenance service plan starts at $14.00 per month  ( See maintenance plans for more info ), or our hourly rate is $60 per hour and we record our time on the job per quarter hour.

These coins served as money in this country until 1933, until they were called in by President Franklin Roosevelt.  Other popular old U.S. gold coins are the $10, $5, $2-1/2, and $1 coins, both the Liberty type and the Indian Head type. Whereas the $20 coins are dubbed Double Eagles, the $10 coins are called Eagles, the $5 coins Half Eagles, and the $2-1/2 coins Quarter Eagles.     Old U.S. gold coins are good investments only when they sell at spot or at small premiums over spot. Look at the graph that tracks VF-grade $20 Libertys against the spot price of gold. At times, VF $20 Libs have traded at spot and at other times they have carried big premiums. Specifically, in the early 1980s, the late 1980s, and early 1990s, VF $20 Libs traded at spot; however, in the mid-1980s and the mid- to late-1990s, they gained premiums. Graphs that plot higher-grade Double Eagles' prices against spot show the same relationship. In 1992, MS-62 St. Gaudens sold at $20 over spot. CMIGS believes premiums on old U.S. gold coins could shrink further as the price of gold climbs higher.    View Graph >>    Typically, old U.S. gold coins pick up premiums during periods of heavy promotions. The graph shows two such periods.        In the early 1980s, when gold prices were in decline after their run-up to $850 in 1980, little new money was entering the gold market. As a result, many dealers recommended that South African Krugerrands, which dominated the bullion coin market then, be traded for old U.S. gold coins because Krugerrands were going to be confiscated.        Confiscation was an easy story to sell because South Africa's apartheid system was being condemned worldwide and the negative publicity surrounding the issue lent credence to the idea of confiscation. However, only a symbolic ban on the importation of Krugerrands was imposed, and there was never any proposal in Congress (or anywhere else for that matter) to confiscate Krugerrands. Nevertheless, many investors switched to old U.S. gold coins and their premiums rose substantially. In time, though, the fear of confiscation died, and premiums shrank.         In 1998, as apprehension grew about the approach of the year 2000, the gold coin market became ripe for another promotion of old U.S. gold coins. This time promoters hyped them as protection against the collapse of the world's computers and the banking system. The fear was so widespread that bank regulators required Y2K compliance. Today, Y2K is a faint memory.         Nevertheless, Y2K was a real concern to many investors who accepted the notion of old U.S. gold coins being ""non-confiscateable."" ""Confiscation"" is a theory that holds no validity, but again premiums on old U.S. gold coins climbed. However, when January 1, 2000, rolled around and no problems arose, investors began selling and premiums dropped precipitously. For a further discussion on the promotion of old U.S. gold coins, read  Myths, Misunderstandings, and Outright Lies.         Another big danger to investing in old U.S. gold coins is the huge overhang in Europe. At the end of WWII, the United States held the world's largest hoard of gold, and U.S. dollars were redeemable in gold by foreign governments. Following the war, the U.S. poured billions into rebuilding Europe via the Marshall Plan. Additionally, to stimulate European economic growth, the U.S. opened its markets to European goods. Consequently, massive quantities of dollars flowed to Europe.        As prosperity returned, Europeans converted those billions of dollars to gold. So great was the conversion that on August 15, 1971, President Nixon closed the ""gold window"" because the redemptions threatened to empty U.S. gold vaults. Much of the gold sent to Europe was old U.S. gold coin. Even before WWII, U.S. gold coins had been popular in Europe, and gold-loving Europeans hoarded them.         No reliable statistics are available on how many old U.S. gold coins European banks hold, but, undoubtedly, it is in the tens of millions. Between 1850 and 1933, U.S. mints turned out more than 165 million Double Eagles. The mints also produced millions of smaller gold coins. Today, several large numismatic wholesale firms have offices in Europe for finding hoards of old U.S. coins. One firm used to advertise ""Shipments coming in from Europe daily."" Another firm boasts ""Offices in Brussels, Paris, and Zurich.""         Although European central banks have been sellers of gold in recent years, holders of old U.S. gold coins have curtailed sales.  Despite the reduced supply, premiums on old U.S. gold coins have shrunk. CMIGS believes premiums on old U.S. gold coins will fall further because of the overhang in Europe.        As gold rallies back to a level where Europeans again become sellers, old U.S. gold coins will flood the market. VF $20 Libs will again sell at spot; MS-62 St. Gaudens will sell at bullion coin prices. So, while old U.S. gold coins have significant premiums, bullion coins are the better buys. CMIGS recommends The Perth Mint's Gold Horses because they sell at bullion coin prices but have numismatic potential.         Although bullion coins are the better investment right now, when Double Eagles again sell at or near spot, they will be the better buys.  Double Eagles will be the better investment because someday they will again achieve premiums and provide investors the opportunity to increase the number of ounces of gold they own without laying out any more cash. A real-life example illustrates the principle.         In the late 1980s, a CMIGS client purchased 192 VF $20 Libs. By looking at the graph, you can see the client bought the coins near the spot price of gold. In 1998, when the premiums were high, the client traded the 192 $20 Libs for 1-oz Gold Eagles. The client received 236 Gold Eagles for a 50-ounce increase. It was a 50-ounce increase because a Double Eagle contains .9675 ounce of gold. So, the client traded 186 ounces (192 X .9675 = 185.76) of gold for 236. Gold coin buyers should keep this trading strategy in mind. It can be quite profitable.        Coin Grades      Anyone investing in old U.S. gold coins soon hears about ""coin grades."" A coin's ""grade"" is a visual evaluation of how much wear a coin has suffered. Coins with little wear are graded higher and bring higher prices than those with significant wear. However, a low-grade key coin could easily be more valuable than a high-grade common-date coin. A key coin is a difficult to find, rare coin. By contrast, common-date coins are in abundance.        Below is the spectrum of coin grades as developed by the American Numismatic Association (ANA). The discussion that follows is to inform new investors as to the complexities of coin grading; it is not a guide to coin grading. Investors wanting to become more knowledgeable about old U.S. gold coins and grading them should get a copy of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, commonly called The Red Book. Send $12 to Certified Mint, and we will mail you a copy.              Low-grade coins show considerable wear. Coins graded MS-60 are considered Mint State (Mint State [MS] is used interchangeably with uncirculated). Mint State coins have no signs of wear but may show contact marks, and the surface may be spotted or lack some luster. Coins graded MS-61 and higher should have increasing luster or be lightly toned with very few contact marks. The greater the luster or toning and fewer the contact marks, the higher the grading. An MS-70 coin would be in perfect condition. Very few regular issue coins are graded MS-70.        Anyone can easily see the wear on low-end coins, but accurately determining whether a coin is an F-12 or VF-20 requires experience in coin grading. Differentiating between an AU-55 and an MS-60 coin calls for even more skill. Finally, grading a coin either MS-62 or MS-63 becomes subjective, and ""experts"" often disagree. Consequently, the grading services have become invaluable to investors.        PCGS, NGC, and ""Slabbed"" Coins           In the mid-1980s, over-grading had become wide spread. It was common for circulated coins (below MS-60) to be put in plastic holders (""slabbed""), labeled MS-62 or MS-63, and sold to unsuspecting investors.        Since the buyers usually could not detect the over-grading, they did not know they had been taken advantage of until they sold. One investor in the late 1980s put $150,000 into old U.S. gold coins, many of which had been graded MS-62 or MS-63 by the firm from which he bought them. Three years later - at the suggestion of CMIGS - he submitted them to PCGS and learned that most of the coins had been over-graded by as much as five grades. His $150,000 investment was worth less than $35,000. Unfortunately, this investor's situation was not unique. It appears that thousands of investors have suffered similar losses.        Ethical numismatists decried the over-grading and screamed that it was damaging coin collecting - and it was. Then Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) launched a unique concept in 1986. PCGS would only grade coins. The company would not sell coins. Its income would be derived only from grading fees, and it would survive only if it did a credible job.        There are many skilled numismatists across the country, and while most of them do not always agree with PCGS grading, PCGS thrives because its grading is fair and competent. PCGS now grades 100,000 to 150,000 coins a month.        In 1986, Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC) sprung up to provide still another grading service. And, NGC has prospered, also grading thousands of coins monthly. PCGS and NGC have been so successful that no major retail firms now ""slab"" their own coins. (Putting a coin in a plastic holder with its grade marked on the holder is called ""slabbing."") Other grading services have attempted to emulate PCGS and NGC, but none have become as accepted as have the two major grading services.       PCGS's and NGC's coin grading services provide a greatly needed benefit to investors who purchase old U.S. gold coins. Now, investors can buy coins that probably are graded accurately. Although coin grading has definite guidelines, coin grading remains as subjective as a beauty contest. A coin can be slabbed MS-62, and two knowledgeable numismatists - both with more experience than the PCGS or NGC graders--can disagree. One may say it's a MS-61, while the other says it's a MS-63!        Just because a coin is slabbed doesn't mean its grade is final. Many coin dealers resubmit coins, asking for a higher grading. Often, they get it. Other coin dealers frequently bust the coins out of their holders and resubmit. Coin grading is that subjective.        In fact, slabbed coins trade ""sight-seen"" and ""sight-unseen."" Sight-seen means buyers have to see the coins and agree with the grading before paying. Sight-unseen means buyers will take the coins without seeing them.        One longtime numismatist claims that ""a coin's unique appearance, luster, toning, depth of strike or peculiarities can affect offers as much as 100% in rare cases."" Unique coins usually trade ""sight-seen,"" while common-date MS-61s, -62s, and -63s trade ""sight- unseen."" It takes great knowledge to profitably trade in old U.S. gold coins.        Gold investors should avoid old U.S. gold coins and the numismatic market. Numismatics (coin collecting) is a world of its own. Many pitfalls await novice investors, the worst being overpriced coins from unprincipled dealers. Although over-graded coins ceased to be a problem after PCGS and NGC started slabbing coins, overpriced coins remains a major hazard for gold coin buyers. Furthermore, liquidity can be a major problem .        The longtime numismatist mentioned above recommends ""allowing at least 30 days for a dealer to sell your rare coins."" He says ""sudden emergency liquidation can reduce your realized price by 5% to 20%."" That's a generous evaluation of the numismatic market. If you're sold overpriced coins, you can watch 50% of your investment disappear regardless how much time you give a dealer. Besides, do you really want to put a part of your life's savings in something that may take 30 days to liquidate? What if it takes 60 days, or 120?       Consider also another tip offered by the above numismatist on ""How to Sell Your Coins at Maximum Prices.""             Find a dealer you can trust          Okay, but how do you find that honest dealer? How many corrupt dealers do you go through finding him? How much do you lose in bad buys before you connect with an honest dealer?         Why not invest in gold you can trust, gold that moves dollar for dollar with the world price of gold? Why not buy gold bullion coins that can be liquidated at prices which can be determined by anyone? Why not put your money in gold coins that make you the ""expert"" on how much they are worth?       Here's another tip from the numismatist:              Always have your current expert get offers from the dealer who sold you the coins originally. Different dealers support different markets.          This advice exposes two more flaws of investing in numismatic coins. First, your ""current expert"" has to go back to your former ""expert."" Why aren't you still dealing with the original expert? Again, how many ""experts"" do you have to go through before you find that honest dealer?         Second, you should never invest in a coin whose value is determined by the support of a certain dealer or marketing organization. Those firms move from coin to coin, always wanting to have ""something new"" to offer their customers. When they move on, previous promoted coins suffer. Avoid this problem by investing in bullion coins.        This Web page is long, and you are to be congratulated for reading this far. Your time has been well spent. What you have learned could save you thousands of dollars and great heartache.        The unfortunate story told above about the man who invested $150,000 but received coins worth $35,000 is not unique. A husband and wife a few years ago had CMIGS evaluate a group of common-date ""slabbed"" MS-62 Double Eagles. They had paid $72,000 for the coins. Sadly, they should have paid no more than $48,000. They suffered an immediate loss of $24,000, one-third of their investment.        In early 1998, another investor who wanted only to invest in gold called a firm that advertises Gold Eagles extensively. However, after being told that numismatic coins were ""not confiscateable,"" he put $27,000 into a variety of old U.S. gold coins graded MS-62 through MS-65. He subsequently learned that the coins could be sold for only about $21,000. The man suffered an immediate $6,000 or 22% loss.        Such losses can be avoided by investing in bullion coins.

Rarity of the coin has a huge affect on rare coin value. There are some                rare coins with a value of more than $1,000,000 and there are some              common coins with the face value or little value.                                                                                                                  Most of the time, the  rare coins  are the once, which can appreciate              in value dramatically over some time and these are the once collectors              seek the most. You can read more on the Value of Rare Coins on our  Coin Values  page.                                                                                              Rare Coins  Prices                                                                                                                                                                       Rare coins prices  depend on a lot of factors and we                      will discuss some of them here:                     1)  Coin Grading : Value of rare coins depends a lot                      on the  coin grading . Usually,                      even a difference in 1 grade makes coins 2-3 times more expensive.                     2)  Mintage  or how rare the coin is also affects the                      value. Coins minted in low mintages would have a better value                      in the series. Even if 2 coins look and grade identical and                      only differ in 1 year, the coin with the lower mintage for                      the year will have higher value.                     3)  Coin Market : - Demand and Supply for coins creating                      a coin market, where value of the coin would be influenced                      by a lot of political and economical factors. For ex: Some                      of the rare old coins from Eastern Europe would cost very                      little only, because there is a little demand and people can't                      afford to have the luxury of collecting coins. NOTE: We can                      see that this is changing now and some coins from Eastern                      Europe, especially Russian coins have a huge opportunity to                      increase in value and already started to become expensive                      even for serious investors.                     4)  Rare Silver  Coins  and  Rare Gold  Coins  -                      There is an increasing demand in rare coins made from precious                      metals, such as silver and gold. The value of these rare coins                      grown dramatically in last years affected by increase in commodity                      prices and high demand. Refer to  Silver                      Coins  page and  Gold Coins                       page for more information about rare silver coins, rare gold coins and rare gold coins value.                                               5)  Error Coins  - Some collectors specialize in so-called                      error coins. These are the coins that have been minted in                      error or with some unintended mistake in design. Prices of                      error coins vary considerably, and are based on denomination,                      date (if the date is visible), how significant the error,                      error type, how scarce the error is, and the dealer's demeanor.                                         NOTE:  Be aware that values of error coins have been                      stable and steady over the decades. This is not an investment                      hobby, but an enjoyable and educational experience, and a                      good illustration of our imperfect world.

The following summarizes some of the main advantages of  rare                      coin investments .                      1) Rare coins have historically protected or preserved wealth                      as strong inflation fighters, particularly in countries whose                      paper currency has been severely weakened. Any time our paper                      money is threatened, rare coins can protect wealth much like                      an investment in gold bullion.                                             2) Rare coins are selling at steep discount to their 1980's                      highs and, given the cyclical nature of the rare coin market,                      may be poised for rapid price appreciation in the near future.                                            3) The beauty of rare coins can be enjoyed much like any other                      work of art. They are also a very private form of investment                      not subject to government scrutiny common to other types of                      investments held in banks and by brokerage houses.                                             4) Rare coins are easy to store and are virtually indestructible.                      They are also insurable. Rare coins represent truly portable                      wealth which can be moved from place to place very quickly                      and easily.                                            5) With thousands of coin dealers around, selling most quality                      rare coins is quite easy making them a fairly liquid investment.                                            Collecting  rare coins  is a great hobby that can also be an excellent investment for the future. Learn everything you can about rare coins to take advantage of this valuable investment opportunity.                       Top                                                                                                                                                                                          Guidelines for Rare Coin Investors                                                                                                                                           Here a few basic guidelines that prospective investors in                      rare coins may benefit from.                      1) Have clear objectives in mind when buying rare coins as                      an investment. Decide what types of rare coins you should                      acquire, the total amount you wish to invest in rare coins                      and the circumstances under which you will consider selling                      your coins.                                             2) Keep in mind that the market for rare coins can be particularly                      volatile. Further, the difference or ""spread"" between                      dealer buy and sell prices is normally much higher than the                      commissions charged by brokers for equity investments. Consequently,                      before rare coins can be sold by an investor at a gain, a                      larger appreciation in the rare coin prices must occur than                      may be the case for other investments.                                            3) Only buy rare coins graded and authenticated by the leading                      independent grading services whose standards are accepted                      industry-wide.                                            4) Only buy rare coins that are popular with collectors and                      are actively traded. Avoid thinly-traded esoteric coin issues                      which may be very difficult to sell in the future.                                            5) If you are planning to buy very expensive rare coins through                      the web, buy only Certified Coins.

The best known old U.S.         gold coins are the $20 Libertys and $20 St. Gaudens, also dubbed  Double         Eagles  . Other popular old U.S. gold coins are the $10, $5, $2-1/2,         and $1 coins, both the Liberty type and the Indian Head type. Whereas         the $20 coins are commonly called  Double Eagles , the $10 coins         are called  Eagles , the $5 coins  Half Eagles , and the         $2-1/2 coins  Quarter Eagles.           Old U.S. gold coins are good investments         only when they sell at spot or at small premiums over spot.          Look         at the graph that tracks VF-grade $20 Libertys against the spot price of         gold . At times, VF $20 Libs have traded at spot and at other times         they have carried big premiums. Specifically, in the early 1980s, the         late 1980s, and early 1990s, VF $20 Libs traded at spot; however, in the         mid-1980s and the mid- to late-1990s, they gained premiums. Graphs that         plot higher-grade Double Eagles' prices against spot show the same         relationship. In 1992, MS-62 St. Gaudens sold at $20 over spot.  CMI          believes premiums on old U.S. gold coins could shrink further when gold         rises above $300.                                       View Graph           Typically, old U.S. gold coins pick up         premiums during periods of heavy promotions. The graph shows two such         periods.           In the early 1980s, when gold prices were         in decline after their run-up to $850 in 1980, little new money was         entering the gold market. As a result, many dealers recommended that         South African Krugerrands, which dominated the bullion coin market then,         be traded for old U.S. gold coins because Krugerrands were going to be         confiscated.           Confiscation was an easy story to sell         because South Africa's apartheid system was being condemned worldwide         and the negative publicity surrounding the issue lent credence to the         idea of confiscation. However, only a symbolic ban on the importation of         Krugerrands was imposed, and there was never any proposal in Congress         (or anywhere else for that matter) to confiscate Krugerrands.         Nevertheless, many investors switched to old U.S. gold coins and their         premiums rose substantially. In time, though, the fear of confiscation         died, and premiums shrank.           In 1998, as apprehension grew about the         approach of the year 2000, the gold coin market became ripe for another         promotion of old U.S. gold coins. This time promoters hyped them as         protection against the collapse of the world's computers and the banking         system. The fear was so widespread that bank regulators required Y2K         compliance. Today, Y2K is a faint memory.           Nevertheless, Y2K was a real concern to         many investors who accepted the notion of old U.S. gold coins being         ""non-confiscateable."" ""Confiscation"" is a theory         that holds no validity, but again premiums on old U.S. gold coins         climbed. However, when January 1, 2000, rolled around and no problems         arose, investors began selling and premiums dropped precipitously.

Another big danger to investing in old         U.S. gold coins is the huge overhang in Europe. At the end of WWII, the         United States held the world's largest hoard of gold, and U.S. dollars         were redeemable in gold by foreign governments. Following the war, the         U.S. poured billions into rebuilding Europe via the Marshall Plan.         Additionally, to stimulate European economic growth, the U.S. opened its         markets to European goods. Consequently, massive quantities of dollars         flowed to Europe.           As prosperity returned, Europeans         converted those billions of dollars to gold. So great was the conversion         that on August 15, 1971, President Nixon closed the ""gold         window"" because the redemptions threatened to empty U.S. gold         vaults. Much of the gold sent to Europe was old U.S. gold coin. Even         before WWII, U.S. gold coins had been popular in Europe, and gold-loving         Europeans hoarded them.           No reliable statistics are available on         how many old U.S. gold coins European banks hold, but, undoubtedly, it         is in the tens of millions. Between 1850 and 1933, U.S. mints turned out         more than 165 million Double Eagles. The mints also produced millions of         smaller gold coins. Today, several large numismatic wholesale firms have         offices in Europe for finding hoards of old U.S. coins. One firm used to         advertise ""Shipments coming in from Europe daily."" Another         firm boasts ""Offices in Brussels, Paris, and Zurich."" In         recent years, though, the repatriation of old U.S. gold coins has slowed         to a trickle.           Although European central banks have been         sellers of gold in recent years, holders of old U.S. gold coins have         curtailed sales because of low prices. Yet, despite the reduced supply,         premiums on old U.S. gold coins have shrunk.  CMI          believes premiums on old U.S. gold coins will fall further because of         the overhang in Europe.                    As gold rallies back to the level where Europeans again become sellers,         old U.S. gold coins will flood the market. VF $20 Libs will again sell         at spot; MS-62 St. Gaudens will sell at bullion coin prices. So, while         old U.S. gold coins have significant premiums, bullion coins are the         better buys.  CMI  recommends the Perth         Mint's Gold Dragons because they sell at bullion coin prices but have         numismatic potential.           Although bullion coins are the better         investment right now, when  Double Eagles  again sell at or near         spot, they will be the better buys. ( CMI          anticipates that to occur when gold rallies to the $330 area; however,         it could happen before then.)  Double Eagles  will be the better         investment because someday they will again achieve premiums and provide         investors the opportunity to increase the number of ounces of gold they         own without laying out any more cash. A real-life example illustrates         the principle.           In the late 1980s, a  CMI          client purchased 192 VF $20 Libs. By looking at the  graph ,         you can see the client bought the coins near the spot price of gold. In         1998, when the premiums were high, the client traded the 192 $20 Libs         for 1-oz Gold Eagles. The client received 236 Gold Eagles for a 50-ounce         increase. It was a 50-ounce increase because a  Double Eagle          contains .9675 ounce of gold. So, the client traded 186 ounces (192 X         .9675 = 185.76) of gold for 236. Gold coin buyers should keep this         trading strategy in mind. It can be quite profitable.                   Coin Grades                   Anyone investing in old U.S. gold coins soon hears about                 ""coin grades."" A coin's ""grade"" is a visual evaluation of how much                 wear a coin has suffered. Coins with little wear are graded higher and bring higher prices                 than those with significant wear. However, a low-grade key coin could easily be more                 valuable than a high-grade common-date coin. A key coin is a difficult to find, rare coin.                 By contrast, common-date coins are in abundance.                   Below is the spectrum of coin grades as developed by the American Numismatic Association (ANA).                 The discussion that follows is to inform new investors as to the complexities of                 coin grading; it is not a guide to coin grading. Investors wanting to become more                 knowledgeable about old U.S. gold coins and grading them should get a copy of R.S.

Coin grades (from low to high):                                                                   AG-3                          G-4                          VG-8                          F-12                          VF-20                          VF-30                                                                                                                                      EF-40                               EF-45                          AU-50                          MS-60                          MS-65                          MS-70                                                                                                                                                                       Low-grade coins show considerable wear. Coins graded                 MS-60 are considered Mint State (Mint State [MS] is used interchangeably with                 uncirculated). Mint State coins have no signs of wear but may show contact marks, and the                 surface may be spotted or lack some luster. Coins graded MS-61 and higher should have                 increasing luster or be lightly toned with very few contact marks. The greater the luster                 or toning and fewer the contact marks, the higher the grading. An MS-70 coin would be in                 perfect condition. Very few regular issue coins are graded MS-70.                   Anyone can easily see the wear on low-end coins, but accurately                 determining whether a coin is an F-12 or VF-20 requires experience in coin grading.                 Differentiating between an AU-55 and an MS-60 coin calls for even more skill. Finally,                 grading a coin either MS-62 or MS-63 becomes subjective, and ""experts"" often                 disagree. Consequently, the grading services have become invaluable to investors.                                   PCGS, NGC, and  ""Slabbed""                  Coins                                                                                                              .                                                                       .                                                                                    NGC graded MS63                        1904 $20 Liberty                                             PCGS graded                     MS63                      1924 $20 St. Gaudens                                                         In the mid-1980s, over-grading had become wide spread. It                 was common for circulated coins (below MS-60) to be put in plastic holders                 (""slabbed""), labeled MS-62 or MS-63, and sold to unsuspecting investors.                   Since the buyers usually could not detect the over-grading,                 they did not know they had been taken advantage of until they sold. One investor in the                 late 1980s put $150,000 into old U.S. gold coins, many of which had been graded MS-62 or                 MS-63 by the firm from which he bought them. Three years later - at the suggestion of                  CMI  - he submitted them to PCGS and learned that                 most of the coins had been over-graded by as much as five grades. His $150,000 investment                 was worth less than $35,000. Unfortunately, this investor's situation was not unique.                 Thousands of investors have suffered similar losses.                   Ethical numismatists decried the over-grading and screamed that                 it was damaging coin collecting - and it was. Then Professional Coin Grading Service                 (PCGS) launched a unique concept in 1986. PCGS would only grade coins. The company would                 not sell coins. Its income would be derived only from grading fees, and it would survive                 only if it did a credible job.                   There are thousands of skilled numismatists across the country,                 and while most of them do not always agree with PCGS grading, PCGS thrives because its                 grading is fair and competent. PCGS now grades 100,000 to 150,000 coins a month.                   In 1986, Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC) sprung up to                 provide still another grading service. And, NGC has prospered, also grading thousands of                 coins monthly. PCGS and NGC have been so successful that no major retail firms now                 ""slab"" their own coins. (Putting a coin in a plastic holder with its grade                 marked on the holder is called ""slabbing."") Other grading services have                 attempted to emulate PCGS and NGC, but none have become as accepted as have the two major                 grading services.                   PCGS's and NGC's coin grading services provide a greatly needed                 benefit to investors who purchase old U.S. gold coins. Now, investors can buy coins that                 probably are graded accurately. Although coin grading has definite guidelines, coin                 grading remains as subjective as a beauty contest. A coin can be slabbed MS-62, and two                 knowledgeable numismatists - both with more experience than the PCGS or NGC graders--can                 disagree. One may say it's a MS-61, while the other says it's a MS-63!                   Just because a coin is slabbed doesn't mean its grade is final.                 Many coin dealers resubmit coins, asking for a higher grading. Often, they get it. Other                 coin dealers frequently bust the coins out of their holders and resubmit. Coin grading is                 that subjective.                   In fact, slabbed coins trade ""sight-seen"" and                 ""sight-unseen."" Sight-seen means buyers have to see the coins and agree with the                 grading before paying. Sight-unseen means buyers will take the coins without seeing them.                   One longtime numismatist claims that ""a coin's unique                 appearance, luster, toning, depth of strike or peculiarities can affect offers as much as                 100% in rare cases."" Unique coins usually trade ""sight-seen,"" while                 common-date MS-61s, -62s, and -63s trade ""sight- unseen."" It takes great                 knowledge to profitably trade in old U.S. gold coins.                   Gold investors should avoid old U.S. gold coins and the                 numismatic market. Numismatics (coin collecting) is a world of its own. Many pitfalls                 await novice investors, the worst being overpriced coins from unprincipled dealers.                 Although over-graded coins ceased to be a problem after PCGS and NGC started slabbing                 coins, overpriced coins remains a major hazard for gold coin buyers. Furthermore,                 liquidity can be a major problem .                   The longtime numismatist mentioned above recommends                 ""allowing at least 30 days for a dealer to sell your rare coins."" He says                 ""sudden emergency liquidation can reduce your realized price by 5% to 20%.""                 That's a generous evaluation of the numismatic market. If you're sold overpriced coins,                 you can watch 50% of your investment disappear regardless how much time you give a dealer.                 Besides, do you really want to put a part of your life's savings in something that may                 take 30 days to liquidate? What if it takes 60 days, or 120?                   Consider also another tip offered by the above numismatist on                 ""How to Sell Your Coins at Maximum Prices.""                                             Find a dealer you can trust                                     Okay, but how do you find that honest dealer? How many corrupt                 dealers do you go through finding him? How much do you lose in bad buys before you connect                 with an honest dealer?                    Why not invest in gold you can trust, gold that moves dollar                 for dollar with the world price of gold? Why not buy gold bullion coins that can be                 liquidated at prices which can be determined by anyone? Why not put your money in gold                 coins that make you the ""expert"" on how much they are worth?                   Here's another tip from the numismatist:                                             Always have your current expert get                     offers from the dealer who sold you the coins originally. Different dealers support                     different markets .                                     This advice exposes two more flaws of investing in numismatic                 coins. First, your ""current expert"" has to go back to your former                 ""expert."" Why aren't you still dealing with the original expert? Again, how many                 ""experts"" do you have to go through before you find that honest dealer?                   Second, you should never invest in a coin whose value is                 determined by the support of a certain dealer or marketing organization. Those firms move                 from coin to coin, always wanting to have ""something new"" to offer their                 customers. When they move on, previous promoted coins suffer. Avoid this problem by                 investing in bullion coins.                   This Web page is long, and you are to be congratulated for                 reading this far. Your time has been well spent. What you have learned could save you                 thousands of dollars and great heartache.                   The unfortunate story told above about the man who invested                 $150,000 but received coins worth $35,000 is not unique. A husband and wife not long ago                 had  CMI  evaluate a group of common-date ""slabbed"" MS-62 Double Eagles.                 They had paid $72,000 for the coins. Sadly, they should have paid no more than $48,000.                 They suffered an immediate loss of $24,000, one-third of their investment.                   In early 1998, another investor who wanted only to invest in                 gold called a firm that advertises Gold Eagles extensively. However, after being told that                 numismatic coins were ""not confiscateable,"" he put $27,000 into a variety of old                 U.S. gold coins graded MS-62 through MS-65. He subsequently learned that the coins could                 be sold for only about $21,000. The man suffered an immediate $6,000 or 22% loss.                   Such losses can be avoided by investing in bullion coins. Don't                 take unnecessary risks with your money.

Nisyros Nisyros Coins Nisyros Hot Springs Nisyros Map   Nisyros was created from the stone snatched from Kos by Poseidon, god of the sea, which he flung a great distance to kill the giant Polybotes. The stone fell into the sea, and became Nisyros. A volcanic island with black rocks. The first inhabitants of the island seem to have excavations suggest that the ancient city, within its fortification walls, was inhabited from the 5th c. BC to the 5th c. AD; there was an earlier Bronze Age city near the harbour.   After the middle of the 4th c. BC, Nisyros struck bronze coins to serve the needs of local trade, on which is depicted the head of Poseidon with his symbols, the dolphin and trident, and that of Zeus Ammon. The influence of Rhodos on the coins is apparent from the representation of the head of Apollo and the rose.       Silver drachm c. 360-340 BC. O. Head of Helios R.

Extensive instructions and background information allow you to restore the coin then be able to identify it from among over 200 different personalities. This is one of the best educational products on the market!  $59.95             Uncleaned coins from the Balkan region (Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and neighbouring countries). Most will date from the late 3rd century through the late 4th. Roman coins found in this region tend to have a good mix of eastern Roman mints, particularly Constantinople, Siscia and Thessalonica. These coins when properly restored will generally reveal enough detail to allow identification. Sizes range from about a dime to a penny.  $2.50  per coin.            As above but higher grade. These coins have a higher chance of cleaning up to reveal more detail than the regular uncleaned coins because some of that detail is already peeking through the dirt. The downside? Less chances of finding rare emperors because the metal detectorists who recover them have already had a peek. Most will therefore end up being of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties of the fourth century AD.  $5.00  per coin.      Balkan-region Late Roman bronze coins already cleaned and ready to display. Most coins will rate VG-VF graded by wear and date from about 250 through the early 400's.

Here are genuine ancient coins with pieces missing or holes through them that don't quite make the cut. They make great practice coins to learn the proper way of restoring antiquities and often end up being collectibles themselves. Sold in packets of 10 for  $4.00  each.          Perfectly round coins that come from the former Soviet bloc countries? Have fun restoring these ""modern"" uncleaneds that are in fact just merely OLD coins from the late 1700's through the 20th century. Most will clean up to be coins of countries, kingdoms and empires that no longer exist. Who knows what you will find!  $2.00  each.

The       valuable question then is; that are old coins worth the       money spent in buying them? Yes indeed! Old coins have a       history bonded with them that intensifies their essence.               Each coin narrates the coinage       of those days through the carvings on it. Coins could depict       different hierarchy of the empire and colonies centuries ago       or represent stories of their creation. Value of these coins       is decided by the grade of each coin. The finer the grade of       the coin the higher is the value of the coin. There are some       interesting listings on websites providing helpful       information on these.                 Around 600BC India had       developed some of the world's earliest coins. The coins were       irregularly shaped and made of silver. For indications, a       series of punches, covering a variety of symbols, were made       in the front. Likewise, other countries like China, America,       Pakistan, Afghanistan etc. also had their share on       collection of old coins.               In America, the value of       enny hillings enceand others were temporarily       assigned new values with the concept of decimalization       introduced. Old coins were gradually out of the economy       system post-decimalization and replaced by new coins made of       different metals. As the coins get older they make a proud       part of your collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Menu                             coins         coin collecting          coin values          coin dealers        collectible coin        gold coins          silver coins          coin auction        old coins          old coin value               coin collectors        rare coins          coin prices          ancient coins        roman coins        Indian coins        US coins          Canadian coins          world coins               coin appraisal & worth        coin price guide        coin value                                                                                                                                                   More            rare coin values         Gold coin values            buy gold coins            how to buy gold coins            coin collecting supplies            ancient coins for sale            popular ancient coins            cleaning ancient coins            coin stores            selling rare coins            rare Indian coins            antique coin dealers            paper currency            Indian paper currency                Home               | |  Contact Us  |     Disclaimer                                    Copyright 2006 Coins.in.

Generally, these misconceptions and                 falsehoods promote the notion that the government may again call                 in gold as it did in 1933 and that ""reportable""                 transactions are preludes to confiscation. By cultivating such                 fears in investors, unscrupulous firms can sell high-priced (and                 often overpriced) coins with greater margins of profit.                   Investors who believe these stories invariably pay too much                 or buy the wrong coins. After reading this Web page, no investor                 need be taken advantage of.                                     Avoiding Confiscation                   The most frequently used technique                 to promote high-priced coins is to raise the issue of                 confiscation. Many telemarketers tell investors that old U.S.                 gold coins are not ""subject to confiscation,"" leaving                 the impression that modern gold bullion coins                 are. Consequently, many investors buy old                 U.S. gold coins at prices significantly higher than the                 value of their gold content. The idea of buying                 ""non-confiscateable'' gold sounds like a powerful argument                 but wilts under scrutiny.                   Many precious metals firms maintain that old U.S. gold coins,                 proof sets, and commemorative gold coins are                 ""collectibles"" and would not be subject to another                 gold recall. Some firms say that premiums of at least 15%                 automatically make coins collectibles. Another notion holds that                 coins one hundred years or older are antiques and therefore not                 subject to confiscation. One large firm that sells rare coins                 goes as far as to say:                                                            Under current federal law, gold bullion can be confiscated                     by the federal government in times of national crisis. As                     collectibles, rare coins do not fall within the provisions                     permitting confiscation.                                                        No federal law or Treasury department regulation supports                 these contentions.                   The myth that specific types of gold coins are ""not                 confiscateable"" stems from the Executive Order that                 President Roosevelt issued in 1933 calling in gold. The                 Executive Order exempted ""gold coins having a recognized                 special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins,"" but                 it did not define special value or collector, and certainly not                 collectibles. Nevertheless, telemarketers promoting old U.S.                 gold coins perpetuate this myth because it makes easier the                 selling of high-priced coins.                   Just because Roosevelt exempted ""gold coins having a                 recognized special value"" does not mean that any future                 call-in would exempt collectibles. Roosevelt's Executive Order                 would have no legal binding on another gold call-in. Besides, on                 December 31, 1974, with Executive Order 11825, President Gerald                 Ford repealed the Executive Order that Roosevelt used to call in                 gold in 1933. This was necessary because on the same day                 Congress restored Americans' right to own gold. Furthermore, in                 1977 Congress removed the president's authority to regulate gold                 transactions during a period of national emergency other than                 war.                   Even if a law did exempt certain coins from future                 confiscation, the government could change that law. Sadly, the                 government often simply ignores laws. Dealers who say they sell                 ""non-confiscateable"" gold have no basis for making                 such claims.                   For further discussion of this matter, assume there were                 another gold call-in. Would old U.S. gold coins, which make up                 the bulk of the ""non-confiscateable"" market, be                 exempted? Probably not because they are common coins. (The old                 U.S. gold coins most often promoted are the $20                 Libertys and the $20 St.                 Gaudens, also known as Double                 Eagles. A $10 coin is called an Eagle, a $5 coin a Half                 Eagle, and a $2-1/2 coin a Quarter Eagle.)                   Although Roosevelt's Executive Order required Americans to                 turn in their gold coins and gold bullion, foreigners continued                 to redeem paper dollars for gold until August 15, 1971, when                 President Nixon closed the gold window. From the end of World                 War II to 1971, our gold reserves were cut in half.                   It is generally believed that all the gold coins surrendered                 under Roosevelt's call-in were melted or refined into .999 fine                 bullion bars. That was not the case. It was to the government's                 advantage to give the foreigners gold coins instead of bullion                 bars.                   With the official price of gold at $35 an ounce, a foreign                 bank presenting $35 million paper dollars received 1,000,000                 ounces if the Treasury delivered gold bullion. However, when the                 Treasury delivered gold coins with a face value of $35 million,                 it delivered only 967,500 ounces, saving 32,500 ounces. Each $20                 Liberty and St. Gaudens (Double Eagles)   contains                 .9675 ounce of gold. The smaller coins contain the same                 proportions. Therefore, it was to the Treasury Department's                 advantage to give out U.S. gold coins instead of bullion bars.                 Additionally, before Roosevelt's call-in, millions of old U.S.                 gold coins already had made their way to Europe.                   So, in view of the government's policy of delivering                 ""confiscated"" gold coins to foreign governments, how                 can a promoter of old U.S. gold coins claim to be selling                 ""non-confiscateable"" gold when the coins he delivers                 may have been called in back in 1933?                   Promoters of old U.S. gold coins rarely reveal the sources of                 their coins. They foster the idea that the coins they sell                 somehow survived the 1933 call-in. Probably, the coins being                 promoted just arrived from Europe a few weeks earlier. Several                 large numismatic wholesale firms have offices in Europe for                 finding hoards of old U.S. coins. One firm advertises                 ""Shipments coming in from Europe daily."" Another firm                 boasts offices in Brussels, Paris, and Zurich.                   As noted above, the premise of ""non-confiscateable""                 gold lies in Roosevelt's Executive Order that exempted                 ""gold coins having recognized special value to collectors                 of rare and unusual coins."" Are old U.S. gold coins                 ""rare and unusual"" today? Not hardly.                   Between 1850 and 1907, U.S. mints turned out over 100 million                 $20 Libertys. Between 1908                 and 1933, they coined some 65 million $20                 St. Gaudens. Today, no one knows how many have survived, but                 the number is undoubtedly in the tens of millions, with the bulk                 of them residing in European bank vaults.                   Because of all the old U.S. gold coins in Europe and because                 of the huge premiums they carry, old U.S. coins are dangerous                 investments at this time. If gold rallies, European banks may                 see it as an opportunity to unload, causing old U.S. gold coins                 to fall in price while gold goes up. For further discussion                 about why old U.S. gold coins are overpriced, see  Old                 U.S. Gold Coins .                   If gold fails to rally, the banks may fear gold will stay                 down for a long time, prompting them to resume selling. This,                 too, would cause the old U.S. gold coins to fall in price,                 shrinking the premiums at which they sell over spot.                   Since 1989, PCGS and NGC, the two major grading services,                 have ""slabbed"" over two million coins rated MS-60 or                 higher. Now, the two services are grading 200,000 to 300,000                 coins a month. (See PCGS, NGC, and ""Slabbed"" Coins on                 our Web page  Old U.S. Gold Coins .)                 Millions of lower-grade coins (VF through BU) do not even                 warrant being submitted. Yet, they are sold as                 ""non-confiscateable"" semi-numismatic coins. Low-grade                 coins that have no real collector value are called                 semi-numismatic. VF/XF common-date Double                 Eagles are definitely semi-numismatic coins.                   Add in the uncounted smaller denomination old gold coins ($10                 Eagles, $5 Half Eagles, etc.) and the number of available old                 U.S. gold coins grows even bigger. There is no way the old U.S.                 gold coins being promoted as ""non-confiscateable"" have                 a ""recognized special value to collectors of rare and                 unusual coins.""                   The concept of ""non-confiscateable"" gold is                 counterfeit. The idea lives only because dealers continue to                 push it for their own benefit. Investors who do not have the                 facts are unable to know otherwise. Readers of this Web page,                 however, need not be victims to the hype and promotion so                 prevalent in the gold coin industry.                   Investors wanting to buy gold should go with the bullion                 coins:  American Gold Eagles ,                  Maple                 Leafs , or  Krugerrands . These                 coins move dollar for dollar with the world price of gold and                 are easy to buy, sell, and trade. Additionally, tracking the                 value of these coins is easy. No ""expert"" has to look                 at them.                                     Avoid European Coins                   Over the last few years, telemarketers have been importing                 European bullion gold coins dated before 1933 and claiming they,                 like old U.S. gold coins, would be legally beyond the reach of                 the government in another recall. The imported coins most                 commonly promoted as  non-confiscateable                  include:                                                             French Twenty Francs (both the Roosters and the                 Angels);                                           British Sovereigns (usually with the images of                 Queen Victoria or Edward II or George V);                                           Swiss Twenty Francs (also called Helvetias);                                           Belgium Twenty Francs (a.k.a. King Leopolds);                                           Swedish and Danish 10 Kroners (Mermaids);                                           Swedish and Danish 20 Kroners;                                           Dutch 10 Guilders.                                     Investors should avoid European coins. As noted above, the                 notion of ""non-confiscateable"" coins has no merit, and                 dealers promoting European coins do so because they provide                 bigger profits. That's bigger profits for the dealers, not their                 clients.                   European coins are not worth the high prices promoters ask.                 Regardless of the dates on them, they are not                 ""non-confiscateable."" Additionally, they hold little,                 if any, numismatic potential. It is a peculiarity of the coin                 collecting that coins are prized by numismatists (coin                 collectors) only in their countries of origin. Americans collect                 U.S. coins; the British collect coins of Great Britain; the                 Japanese collect Japanese coins, etc.                   Furthermore, the European coins are often compared with old                 U.S. gold coins, which can and do achieve premiums at times (See                  Old U.S. Gold Coins ). European                 coins, as a rule, are simply bullion coins and will never attain                 genuine numismatic premiums. Some of the coins have been around                 for a hundred years and have always sold at only a few dollars                 above the value of their gold content. That is why telemarketers                 promote them. They buy the European coins near bullion prices                 and mark them up, ensuring big profits for themselves.                   Still, there are other reasons for not buying European coins,                 even when you can get them at reasonable prices. First, they                 contain unconventional amounts of gold, such as  . 1867 oz,                 or  . 2354 oz, or  . 1947 oz. Americans prefer full                 ounce coins, or fractions of ounces they easily understand, such                 as 1/2-oz, 1/4-oz, or 1/10-oz.                   Second, Americans prefer coins stamped in English. The                 European coins, obviously, are stamped in the languages of their                 countries of origin. But perhaps worse, the European coins do                 not have their gold content stamped on them. If you have to use                 such coins in an emergency, how are you going to convince                 someone other than a coin dealer that the coins contain the gold                 content you say?                   Your best buys in fractional-ounce gold coins are  American                 Eagles ,  Canadian Maple Leafs ,                 or  Krugerrands , although                 fractional-ounce Krugerrands can be difficult to find at times.                 These coins have their gold content stamped in English and come                 in sizes Americans are used to dealing with. Always, these coins                 are cheaper than promoted European coins. Even when you find                 European coins at bullion prices, fractional-ounce Gold Eagles,                 Maple Leafs, or Krugerrands are comparably priced. There are no                 compelling reasons for Americans to buy European coins.                 Americans should buy Gold Eagles, Maple Leafs, or Krugerrands.                                     Reportable Purchases                   Often, promoters will claim that                 the coins they offer are not subject to ""reporting.""                 Such statements imply the government requires gold transactions                 be reported. However, no government regulations require the                 reporting of the purchases of any precious metals, per se. If                 payment is made by cash greater than $10,000, however, it                 becomes a ""cash reporting transaction."" It is not the                 gold that the government wants reported but the cash. Such                 reporting applies to all business transactions involving more                 than $10,000 cash.                   Regarding cash transactions, Official General Instructions                 for IRS Form 8300 read: ""Who Must File. - Each person                 engaged in a trade or business who, during that trade or                 business, receives more than $10,000 in cash in one transaction                 or two or more related transactions must file Form 8300. Any                 transactions conducted between a payer (or its agent) and the                 recipient in a 24-hour period are related transactions.                   This regulation applies to cash - greenbacks, paper money. It                 does not apply to personal checks, wire transfers, or money                 market withdrawals. When cashier's checks or money orders are                 involved, cash reporting may be triggered.                   Form 8300's General Instructions define as cash ""a                 cashier's check, bank draft, traveler's check, or money order                 having a face amount of not more than $10,000."" Using a                 cashier's check less than $10,000 would be a ""cash                 transaction,"" but it would not be reportable because it is                 less than $10,000. However, two cashier's checks, each less than                 $10,000 but totaling more than $10,000 for a single purchase,                 would be considered cash and subject to reporting.                   Further clarification: If an investor makes a $15,000                 investment in gold and pays with a single $15,000 cashier's                 check, it is not reportable. If, however, he pays with two or                 more cashier's checks each less than $10,000, the dealer would                 be obligated to report.                   Cash reporting requirements were not written specifically for                 the precious metals industry but for all businesses. The                 purchase of a car, boat, or jewelry, and payment with two                 cashier's checks, each less than $10,000 but totaling more than                 $10,000, would be a reportable transaction.                   Another example: an investor agrees to buy precious metals                 totaling more than $10,000, again say $15,000, and wants to make                 payments with money from two accounts. If the investor withdraws                 $8,000 from the first account and gets a cashier's check, and                 then gets another cashier's check for $7,000 from the second                 account, the transaction becomes reportable. A purchase of                 $30,000 and payment with two $15,000 cashier's checks would not                 be a reportable transaction. The significant amount is $10,000.                   Personal checks or checks drawn on the payer's own account                 are not considered cash. Form 8300's General Instructions read:                 ""Cash does not included a check drawn on the payer's own                 account, such as a personal check, regardless of the amount.                 ""                                     Related Transactions                   Form 8300's General Instructions                 say ""Transactions are considered related even if they occur                 over a period of more than twenty-four hours if the recipient                 knows, or has reason to know, that each transaction is one of a                 series of connected transactions.""   For example, if                 an investor agrees to buy $20,000 in gold but makes installment                 payments with cash in amounts less than $10,000, the purchase                 would be reportable.                                     Bank Reporting                   It is often erroneously thought                 that banks report to the government all personal checks more                 than $10,000. Banks do not. But, a cash transaction exceeding                 $10,000 requires a bank to fill out and file a Cash Transaction                 Report (CTR). A cash deposit more than $10,000 to any bank or                 other financial institution account by an individual possibly                 would be reported.                                    However, purchases of cashiers checks with cash for amounts                 $3,000 to $10,000 require banks to complete Monetary Instrument                 Reports (MIRs). (Some banks call them Monetary Instrument Logs.)                 MIRs are not filed with the government but are records that                 enable banks to help comply with cash reporting requirements. It                 is not clear when a MIR requires the completion and filing of a                 CTR, but an individual regularly purchasing cashiers checks                 between $3,000 and $10,000 would probably be reported.                   If a business reports a cash transaction, the customer will                 know it. Form 8300 requires name, address, citizenship, and                 social security number. It also asks for method of                 identification, driver's license, passport, etc. Additionally,                 Form 8300's General Instructions call for anyone filing a Form                 8300 to ""provide a written statement to each person named                 in a required Form 8300 on or before January 31 of the year                 following the calendar year in which the cash is received.""                   Finally, Form 8300 General Instructions has a box to be                 marked if the transactions appear ""suspicious."" The                 box can be marked for transactions less than $10,000 if the                 recipient believes the purchaser is trying to avoid cash                 reporting.                   No one wants any red flags at the IRS. Unscrupulous dealers                 know this and use it to avert clear thinking; they use the                 threat of ""reporting"" to raise investor fear. This                 enables them to sell overpriced coins. Investors justify higher                 prices by thinking they are getting ""non-reportable                 gold."" No investor need be taken advantage of this way.                                     Reportable Sales                   Customer sales to dealers of                 certain precious metals exceeding specific quantities call for                 reporting to the IRS on 1099B forms. The 1099B forms are similar                 to other 1099 forms taxpayers commonly receive; the                 ""B"" means they have been issued by a business other                 than a financial entity.                                     Reportable sales  (again, customer sales to dealers) apply                 to 1-oz Gold Maple Leafs, 1-oz Krugerrands, and 1-oz Mexican                 Onzas in quantities of twenty-five or more in one transaction.                 Reporting requirements do not apply to American                 Gold Eagles, no matter the quantities. Furthermore,                 reporting requirements do not apply to any fractional ounce gold                 coins.                   Only one common silver product is reportable when sold:                 pre-1965 U.S. coins. The quantity that causes the filing of a                 1099B, however, is not clear. The IRS bases its authority to                 require reporting on CFTC-approved contracts that call for the                 delivery of $10,000 face value. Consequently, many dealers do                 not report sales of pre-1965 U.S. coins unless the sale totals                 $10,000 face value; others report $1,000 sales.                   Sales of  American Silver                 Eagles ,  privately-minted                 Silver Eagles , and   100-oz silver bars  are not reportable, no                 matter the quantity. Other precious metals products are                 reportable, but they are not covered here because the average                 investor does not trade them.                   Most investors have no first-hand knowledge of these matters;                 consequently, when precious metals dealers talk about cash                 reporting, 8300 forms, or 1099s, investors are unable to know                 that they may not be hearing the whole story. Wanting to avoid                 the government knowing about their precious metals investments,                 many investors are delighted to learn that their purchases will                 not be reported and end up buying overpriced coins.                   As explained under ""Reportable Purchases,"" no                 precious metals purchases are reported unless cash reporting                 thresholds are exceeded. Investors wanting to avoid reportable                 sales should buy American Eagles.                                    The above discussions about cash reporting, IRS Form 8300, and                 bank reporting are for editorial purposes only and should not be                 relied on as definitive and final. Persons involved in cash                 transactions should consult their attorney or accountant.                   Investors wanting to buy gold should go with the bullion                 coins:  American Gold Eagles ,  Maple                 Leafs , or  Krugerrands . These                 coins move dollar for dollar with the world price of gold and                 are easy to buy, sell, and trade.

Collecting Ancient Coins  - A      Classical Tradition                     Roman nobles fascinated      by Greek culture collected ancient Greek coins  and  antiquities during the      reign of Augustus Caesar, when the art and science of numismatics began.       There is no record of  collecting  ancient coins during the Dark Ages,  but      Renaissance magnates beginning with Petrarch collected portraits of       emperors on Roman coins. Their willingness to pay high prices for fine      portrait specimens led to the first  numismatic imitations,  Paduan medals      struck by Cavino and other medalists of the time.                               Different coin types      attract different personalities.  Ancient Greek coins fascinate collectors      drawn to their artistic merit, while among  ancient Roman coins, early      Imperial  issues attract those prizing realistic and imposing portraits of      emperors and their families. Ancient Persian coins have  special meaning to      collectors interested in the history, culture and religion of  Iran. Further      East, the successors of Alexander struck unusual and attractive Indo-Greek      coins in Southwest Asia. Ancient coins were issued in many metals: gold,      silver, electrum (a natural gold-silver alloy), brass, bronze, billon       (debased silver), potin, lead and even nickel. Ancient gold can be      expensive, although some issues  (notably those of the Byzantine Empire) are      very reasonably priced.  Ancient silver coins are normally well preserved,      on the other hand bronze coins often  circulated for long periods and many      examples show considerable wear, as well as the effects of chemical changes.             Biblical coins attract      those interested in early Christianity and ancient Jewish culture. Such      collectors may desire to find a ""Tribute Penny"" denarius of the emperor      Tiberius, a ""Widow's Mite"" lepton,  a  ""Thirty Pieces of Silver"" shekel or      coins of historic personalities such as Herod and Pontius Pilate that they      can buy online.  All of these biblical coins may best be appreciated when      presented in their historical context -- the special theme of Classical      Coins.             Numismatic literature, in      addition to its informative content,  is also a significant collecting      subject. Elegant engraved illustrations of Greek and Roman coins in early      numismatic books are treasured today by collectors. Catalogues offering      ancient coins for sale, either at fixed prices or at auction, are also an      important source of reference information and die study illustrations for      ancient Greek coins, Roman coins, Biblical coins and Persian coins. Such      catalogues sometimes become primary references, for example the Pozzi and      Shore sale catalogues.              Classical Coins offers a      wide selection of numismatic books, monographs, sale catalogues and other      references that you can buy online through our website. These can be good      investments, since they recently have been appreciating even faster than the      coins they describe.

The reference most used for grading coins. is          The Official A.N.A. Grading Standards for United          States Coins. The grading scale used on American          coins is the 70-point scale devised by Dr.          William Shelby. On this scale 0 is barely          recognizable as a coin and 70 is perfect.                             Mint State ranges from MS60 to MS70. - will show          no trace of wear.           Almost Uncirculated ranges from AU50 to AU58.          -show slight traces of wear on the highest          points           Extremely Fine ranges from EF40 to EF45 . - will          show light wear on the high points of the coin.           Very Fine ranges from VF20 to VF35. - will show          light wear (medium wear on the high points of          the coin)          Fine ranges from F12 to F15. - will show          moderate even wear. Some of the detail will be          worn off.           Very Good ranges from VG7 to VG10. - The major          design is there but most of the detail will be          worn off.           Good ranges from G4 to G6. - will show heavy          wear. The major design will be visible but will          be faint i          About Good is AG3. - will show extremely heavy          wear.  Only the outline of the design will          be visible.           Fair is F2. This grade is worn so heavily that          the date may not be easy to make out.           Poor is P1 (basal state). the coin  is so          worn that you can only  determine  the          type .                    In modern numismatics are the study of the coins          of the mid 17th to the 21st century, the period          of machine struck coins.  Varieties,          mint-made errors, the results of progressive die          wear, mintage figures and even the          socio-political context of coin mintings are          also matters of interest.          The term numismatist applies to collectors and          coin dealers as well scholars using coins as          source or studying coins..

clueweb09-en0006-19-24221	"                         Found a neat coin? Add it to the  Tantalus  database!    At Dirty Old Coins we are  obsessed  with ""uncleaned"" ancient Roman coins! We hope some of this excitement rubs off on you too as you become the first to restore a coin last used over 1,500 years ago. Last used, perhaps, to buy a meal or admission into a theater or maybe even to bribe an official!  These uncleaned coins will challenge your patience as you free the coin from its dirt cocoon over the course of days, weeks or perhaps even months. They will captivate you as you wonder how it was lost, who may have last held it, why it was even lost in the first place. Was it the last desperate act of a Roman trying to hide his wealth from the tax collector? Was it ritually abandoned to gain favor from a feared god? Or perhaps lost by a youth on his way to fulfilling an errand?   Will your coin belong to the great Constantinian dynasty of the 300's who introduced Christianity to the Roman empire? Or perhaps a runaway emperor who attempted to upset the incumbent but failed and then fell into obscurity? Or perhaps not an emperor at all but of a Roman woman or an emperor's son or even a fictional being?  Starting an ancient coin collection is much more affordable than most realize.
