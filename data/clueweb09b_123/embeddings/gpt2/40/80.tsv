Occurring                         in nearly all countries, this phenomenon constitutes the major corpus of evidence we possess of humanity’s cultural, cognitive,                         semiotic and artistic beginnings; it is the principal component of surviving pre-historic cultural heritage. Its study is                         today an interdisciplinary, multi-facetted scientific pursuit, which replaces traditional archaeological approaches that focused                         on perceived styles and meanings.                                                                                                                                             Much of this global palaeoart patrimony is under threat, not only from natural agencies, but also and most especially through                         destruction by human agency. The latter can include the conduct of researchers, the effects of site tourism, industrial and                         other development, and polluting emissions that generate atmospheric acidification. Many methods have been developed to study                         aspects of rock art conservation, to learn how and when rock art was created, and to record the images on rock surfaces. In                         all of this work, there is a distinctive trend to preferring non-intrusive methods of study, which involve no physical contact                         with the rock and no removal of samples for analysis. Those applied to petroglyphs (markings made by removing material from                         rock surface) and pictograms (made by adding material to a rock surface) tend to differ, especially in analytical and preservation                         work. For instance, attempts to determine the age of the latter type, which occurs in the forms of rock paintings, drawings,                         prints and stencils, usually focus on the age of the applied substance (or some inclusion found in it), which in the case                         of petroglyphs is not recoverable.                                                                                                                                             Scientific work in this field includes the study of the tools and materials used in rock art production, and the determination                         of paint compositions and microscopic inclusions or other features illuminating processes and behaviour. Often the methods                         used in this resemble those of forensic science. Other work so far conducted has addressed the chemical sourcing of pigment                         materials, and the microscopic excavation of strata of paint residues, mineral accretions, weathering phenomena and patination                         zones. Of importance is also the secure discrimination between natural and humanly made rock markings, to ensure that neither                         is mistaken for the other.                                                                                                                       The iconographic interpretation of rock art, which in the past has dominated the concerns of this field of research, can only                         be regarded as being scientifically based when sound ethnographic information is available. This may be oral, deriving from                         the artists or knowledgeable informants of the same culture, or alternatively it may derive from decipherable inscriptions                         accompanying rock art imagery, in specific world regions. Such access, however, does not exist in most circumstances, and                         other iconographic interpretations are merely freestanding constructs of autosuggestion, reflecting the interpreting intellect                         and perception; they are not testable.                                                                                                                                            Alternative forms of interpretation are more promising, e.g. through the use of analytical tools provided by the cognitive                         sciences and semiotics. Human knowledge derives from concept-building cognitive processes responding to external stimuli,                         thereby accumulating percepts. The introduction of consciously created sensory information stored outside the human brain                         in the form of symbols rendered perceived reality conceptually manageable. Conscious experience became possible because at                         some point in human evolution the neural facilities prompted by the production of early symbols became available for the processing                         of reality’s stochastic stimuli in visual and mental taxonomizing formats. Thus the very early rock art forms the major remaining                         precipitate of our cognitive evolution and is a potential source of information in the quest to understand it. In this, the                         non-figurative component of rock art may be more instructive than the figurative, which in orthodox archaeological approaches                         has been treated as the principal source of information.                                                                                                                                                           Long Entry                                                                       “Rock art” defines somewhat arbitrarily non-utilitarian, humanly made markings on natural rock surfaces, made either by an                         additive (the application of material) or a reductive process (the removal of rock material). The former results in a pictogram                         or rock painting (including pigment drawing, stencil and beeswax figure); the latter is a petroglyph or engraving, sometimes                         called carving. The term rock art is usually not applied to human markings on prepared or dressed stone surfaces, such as                         may be found on buildings or rock-hewn structures (e.g. temples or pyramids). Nor does it include humanly made but unintentional                         rock markings (e.g. occasioned by bulldozers), utilitarian rock markings (e.g. axe grinding grooves) or marks made by non-human                         animal species, even if made “deliberately” (e.g. certain forms of cave bear claw marks in many European caves). Thus the                         term “rock art” is quite arbitrary, intended to refer to rock markings of semiotic content.                                                                                                                   Rock art occurs in nearly all countries. Its uneven distribution is not so much attributable to differences in cultural conventions,                         it is primarily a taphonomic attribute (i.e. a result of preservation bias). In particular, the high-pH and low precipitation                         regimes of arid regions have greatly facilitated its preservation in such areas as the Sahara, Arabia, central Asia, the American                         Southwest, Peru and Australia. Another major determinant of rock art distribution is geology. Some of the largest surviving                         concentrations are those found in the sandstone facies of the former Gondwana plate, which have facilitated the formation                         of rock shelters that provide excellent preservation conditions. Similarly, the practice of Upper Paleolithic rock artists                         to place some of their productions in deep limestone caves has significantly helped the survival of some of that period’s                         rock art. By comparison, the survival of Pleistocene rock art at open sites is limited to very weathering-resistant rock types                         and primarily to arid regions.                                                                                                                   Pre-historic rock art represents by far the largest body of evidence we possess of humanity’s cultural, cognitive and artistic                         beginnings. Through its relative permanence, it has profoundly influenced the beliefs and cultural conventions of subsequent                         societies up to the present. It is therefore an integral part of humanity’s collective memory, and the greatest surviving                         witness of our cultural, cognitive and semiotic evolution.                                                                                                                   Historical and geographical overview                                                                                          Until recent decades, reliable information about global rock art remained severely restricted. For instance, no publication                         about Chinese rock art had appeared in English until 1984, yet the earliest literary mentions of rock art are from China.                         The philosopher Han Fei (280–233 B.C.) provided the first known reference to rock art, while the geographer Li Daoyuan (A.D.                         386–434) described numerous rock art sites in China and even mentioned occurrences in India. In South America, Captain De                         Carvalho first reported rock art in 1598 in what is now Brazil, and published his recordings in 1618. The first known recordings                         in Europe, made by Peder Alfssön in Denmark in 1627, were not published until 1784. More determined scholarly efforts commenced                         during the 19th century, focusing initially on Russia, Scandinavia and northern Africa, later on southern Africa, parts of                         South America, North America, Australia and eventually India.                                                                                                                   With the beginning of the 20th century, after orthodox archaeology finally accepted the authenticity of Franco-Cantabrian                         cave art (which it had rejected for decades), the study of rock art became nominally integrated into mainstream archaeology.                         This promoted the proliferation of stylistic constructs and the development of ultimately unproductive methods. For instance,                         some archaeologists considered that taxonomic constructs and statistical analyses of stylistic or morphological matrices of                         motif types would provide empirical interpretations, in the same way other artifacts were classified and interpreted statistically.                         However, rock art has no archaeologically perceptible time depth, and most major rock art sites are cumulative assemblages                         deriving from different eras. Lumping these different traditions together and treating them as a “style” because they occur                         at the same place serves no useful purpose, and this is even before the complex issues of selective survival (taphonomy) are                         considered. Thus the greatest barrier to integrating rock art successfully into archaeology was the intractability of its                         dating. Worldwide, there have been only about twenty instances of reasonably convincing minimum dating by finding rock art                         under supposedly datable sediments.                                                                                                                   The last few decades of the 20th century witnessed the emergence of rock art research organizations in many parts of the world,                         beginning in North America, Australia and Western Europe. In 1988 these bodies formed the International Federation of Rock                         Art Organizations (IFRAO), which currently has over forty affiliated member associations, covering in effect most of the world.                         One of their principal aims is to introduce scientific methods, grounded in such diverse disciplines as geology, semiotics                         or cognitive science. This trend is currently replacing interpretative endeavors with contextual studies, and concerns with                         meaning are giving way to epistemological rigor.                                                                                                                   The pre-eminence of the Franco-Cantabrian cave art has in some respects overshadowed the appreciation of the many other, often                         much greater rock art traditions, in Europe as well as elsewhere. For instance, the extensive concentrations of petroglyphs                         in Fontainebleau (France), Galicia, western and southern Alps or across Scandinavia receive much less attention, because they                         are of the Holocene rather than the Late Pleistocene. On the other hand, the Ice Age petroglyph traditions of Australia, which                         may well be a hundred times greater than the corpus of European cave art of the same age, also have attracted limited interest.                         Asia, too, comprises several bodies of rock art that surpass numerically any European regional corpus, and some of it is much                         older than the oldest rock art of Europe. Most of the countries of the Middle East are rich in rock art, especially Saudi                         Arabia, Iran and Israel. Across central Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau, there are numerous reports of rock art, but little                         detailed survey work has been conducted. The rock art of Siberia and China is much better explored, with well over 10,000                         sites known in the latter region. India boasts not only one of the largest concentrations of rock art in the world, the currently                         earliest known tradition is also found there. The countries of South-East Asia all feature rock art, as do most islands in                         the Pacific. The world’s largest concentration, however, appears to be that of Australia, thought to be in excess of 100,000                         sites. That continent’s body probably includes the largest Ice Age component, estimated to be up to 20% of the entire corpus.                                                                                                                   Africa, too, boasts some large rock art concentrations, beginning with the several art regions of the Sahara. In terms of                         its artistic finery, Saharan art is matched by few traditions, one of them being the Bushmen/San rock paintings of southern                         Africa. Other painting and petroglyph traditions occur also in that region, and in most other parts of Africa. Finally, the                         Americas are also well endowed with rock art, with major concentration in the Southwest of the United States and neighboring                         areas of Mexico, and in the Andean regions of South America, from western Venezuela to Patagonia. Further bodies of rock art                         occur in much of Central America and in various parts of Brazil.                                                                                                                   Conservation and site management                                                                    Humanity lavishes billions of dollars annually on its art objects, art repositories and art industry. By comparison, its endeavors                         to look after its oldest and most valuable art treasures are miniscule. Despite its appearance of relative robustness, rock                         art is quite fragile, and what we see today is only the tiny surviving fraction of what was once created. Two factors need                         to be distinguished in the deterioration of rock art: the effects of natural processes, and the damage occasioned by human                         agency. The mitigation of the former is often difficult, whereas that of anthropic destruction is in most cases easily achievable.                         Deterioration by humanly introduced factors far outweighs natural degradation. The rock art that exists today does so because                         it has survived a great many natural decay processes, often surviving in a state of relative equilibrium with its ambient                         environment. It could persist much longer if there is no significant change in its preservation conditions, especially one                         introduced by human intervention. This may be as simple as the introduction of human visitation to a formerly pristine site,                         or as complex as the occurrence of acid rain caused by industrialization.                                                                                                                   The principal natural agent of rock art loss is moisture, mainly in the form of rainwater, capillary moisture in porous rock,                         condensation in caves and shelters, freeze-and-thaw cycles, surface run-off, and secondary effects such as salt efflorescence                         or exfoliation. Physical weathering of rock art panels occurs as insolation (solar radiation), lightning strikes, brushfires,                         tectonic adjustments and kinetic damage (aeolian, gravity or water induced). Many forms of biological factors can contribute                         to weathering, including bacteria, fungi, lichens, algae, mosses, larger plants, insects (mud-daubing wasps, termites, bees),                         nesting birds and various larger animals, especially domestic and feral species. For many of these threats, protective measures                         have been found. Site hydrology, for instance, can be controlled by artificial silicone driplines in shelters.                                                                                                                   One animal, however, is causing far greater rock art destruction than all other factors taken together. Of the many forms                         of damage occasioned by humans the perhaps most repulsive is that occasioned by researchers, be it through misguided recording                         activities or through their role in permitting or condoning the destruction of rock art by industrial or infrastructure development.                         The former has been largely eliminated in recent decades, but the latter continues unabated in much of the world. Tourists                         and site visitors contribute to rock art deterioration, though it has often been found necessary to sacrifice some sites to                         them in order to preserve many others. The locations of new sites are no longer made public, and well known pristine sites                         such as Chauvet, Cussac and Cosquer Caves in France are totally closed to all, except a few researchers who only enter these                         sites with careful precautions to prevent contamination. For instance, researchers are not allowed to walk on the floor of                         Chauvet Cave. In Australia, most of the country’s cave art sites are only accessible to two or three researchers.                                                                                                                   The tasks of professional rock art conservators include graffiti removal, moisture and climate monitoring and control, and                         the design of site management measures. The latter differ according to local circumstances, and include such measures as the                         erection of fences to keep out animals, the installation of visitor boardwalks and paths, and in some regions protective grilles.                         In modern site management practice, the concept of “site fabric” is paramount, referring to all physical and non-physical                         aspects of a place, including accretionary deposits on the rock, even its ambience or religious significance. The primary                         principle of intervention at a rock art site is that any modifications must be fully reversible. Today’s site conservation                         and management practices may well be superseded tomorrow, and the cultural resource in question is, after all, not renewable.                                                                                                                   The study of rock art                                                                    Since rock art has begun to be recorded, centuries ago, the purpose of such records has always been to create a visual register                         of those aspects of the art that were deemed important. This has remained so until quite recently, and it follows that rock                         art recordings are usually interpretations of individual observers, not objective data. Indeed, this principle is embodied                         in a ruling of the High Court of Austria in 2003, that rock art recordings are copyrighted because they are individual interpretations                         by the recorder. This is now changing with the introduction of sophisticated digital recording systems that yield much more                         objective results.                                                                                                                   Nevertheless, the ready availability of computer equipment and electronic image manipulating software does not necessarily                         obviate other recording techniques. It is certainly appropriate to discard all those that are invasive or threaten the research                         integrity of rock art. Many such methods have been used extensively in the past, but there is no longer any justification                         to continue with them. These physical enhancement methods have included the application of clear liquids to close the pores                         of silica skins or other thin accretions, thus improving photographic records. Another common practice has been the outlining                         of rock art with chalk and a variety of other markers, including dye, pencil, lipstick, and felt pen. Archaeologists have                         contaminated the geochemical fabric of thousands of square meters of petroglyphs by applying organic white and black paints,                         to facilitate manual recording. The use of pressure-sensitive films, rubbings made with a great variety of materials, the                         production of casts from latex, plaster of Paris, papier mâché, thermoplastic resin and so forth have all been found to affect                         the rock art, and in some cases have caused spectacular damage to it. The use of transparent film to copy fragile art can                         also be damaging, because these sheets tend to be electrostatic and the movement of pens or fingers can attract small flakes                         of material from paintings. Even the use of aluminium foil tamped gently into petroglyphs before it is backed by stiffer material,                         regarded as a reasonably safe method, has been opposed by a chemist working with rock art.                                                                                                                   There is one very simple rule now in recording: unless the rock art in question is about to be destroyed by other factors,                         no invasive method and no contact is acceptable. It would be selfish to prejudice future analytical methods rock art scientists                         of future centuries might bring to bear upon the rock art—methods we cannot begin to speculate about.                                                                                                                   There is no need to resort to damaging and superseded methodology. Photography, sometimes in combination with non-contact                         enhancement techniques, is now universally available. Raking light photography (oblique lighting at night) is far more effective                         in recording petroglyphs than manual recording, which is a cumbersome and subjective procedure. A variety of filters and special                         films are available to improve photographs of rock art. Cross-polarized photography, using two light sources with polarizing                         filters, can greatly enhance contrast. It is important that a calibrated color and gray scale be included on all rock art                         photographs, the most widely used being the IFRAO Standard Scale. This has a number of purposes, the foremost being the facility                         of color reconstitution. All photographic records are of distorted color, and all of them fade with time, therefore a color                         profile included on a photograph permits the digitized recovery of original color of the object at the time the image was                         taken.                                                                                                                   The use of photogrammetry, which has been sporadic in rock art survey work, has experienced a revival due to the introduction                         of digital elevation model (DEM) software. This can generate accurate three-dimensional recordings of petroglyphs. An alternative                         approach is the use of laser scanners to produce virtual digital models of great accuracy and versatility. Micro-topography                         of rock art has also been attempted with a CCD camera by obliquely projecting a grating fine grid over the rock art. The most                         time-consuming method of reproducing panels or sites is the production of physical rock art facsimiles. This has been sporadically                         used for many decades, but recent technological developments render the process much easier and more precise. Facsimiles are                         constructed by first acquiring the necessary topographic data, traditionally either by photogrammetry or the use of precision                         theodolites, but more recently by laser equipment. The rock panel is then recreated and the rock art projected onto it.                                                                                                                   Archaeological age estimations, generated by considerations of style and “content”, have varied greatly for specific corpora.                         In the great majority of cases, they have been refuted by recent scientific dating work, suggesting that age determination                         of rock art by stylistic or archaeological means is tenuous at best. During the 1980s, this led to the replacement by forms                         of “direct dating”, in which the age of dating criteria physically and directly related to the rock art is determined. Propositions                         of the chronological relationship of these criteria with the rock art must be testable, i.e. refutable. The dating criterion                         may be of the same age as the rock art (e.g. an organic binder contained in the paint residue of a pictogram, or the fracture                         surfaces caused by the impact that occurred when a petroglyph was made); or it may be older than the rock art (e.g. its support                         surface, or a lichen thallus dissected by an engraved line); or it may be younger than the rock art (e.g. a superimposed insect                         nest, or a mineral accretion concealing the art). There are numerous types of such directly relatable criteria, most of which                         have been provided by geochemistry so far. However, direct dating offers no actual ages of rock art; it merely generates testable                         propositions about the relevance of specific physical or chemical data to the true age of rock art. The interpretation of                         this relationship demands an understanding of the method used, of the circumstances of sample collection, and of the limitations                         applying to stated results. The principal difficulty experienced with this approach is that the interpretation of its results                         is usually contingent on such complex qualifications that they are difficult to relate to immediate concerns of archaeology.                                                                                                                   The first method used in this quest was radiocarbon analysis of mineral accretions containing atmospheric carbon, such as                         carbonates and oxalates. These are often found in direct physical relation with rock art, but the utility of their results                         is limited by a complex set of qualifications. Uranium-series dating (thorium-uranium) has also been applied to carbonate.                         Most widely used has been the carbon-isotope analysis of inclusions in mineral accretions or in paint residues, and the determination                         of the age of charcoal pigments. Here, the qualifications are somewhat simpler. In the former method, the principal limitation                         is that, to obtain valid estimates, the nature of the analyzed substance must be determined, either at the object or molecular                         level. Until recently, all such determinations referred to bulk samples, but in 2005, an Italian team succeeded in isolating                         the dated substance molecularly in rock paintings at five Libyan sites.                                                                                                                   The determination of carbon ages of charcoal pictograms is a straightforward method, but unfortunately, the date refers to                         the time when the tree in question assimilated carbon from the atmosphere, not to the time of rock art production. Ancient                         charcoal might have been used in this, and often was, which introduces an obvious limitation to such results. The most reliable                         results from any pictograms so far are 137 carbon isotope determinations obtained from beeswax figures in northern Australia.                         An experimental approach is to use sand grains embedded in wasp or termite nests directly related to rock art to determine                         when they were last exposed to light, using the optically stimulated luminescence method.                                                                                                                   Petroglyphs may be more difficult to date than paintings, because they offer no substance relating to the time of their execution.                         Nevertheless, the surfaces then freshly exposed and the mineral crystals broken or truncated experience significant changes                         over time, which are utilized in microerosion analysis. A very robust analytical method, it yields reliable dates for petroglyph                         manufacture, but they are typically imprecise and several preconditions need to be met. Recently, digital colorimetry has                         been applied to both repatinated petroglyphs and pigment pictograms, after surprisingly consistent results were secured from                         historical inscriptions of known ages. Other approaches, so far not effectively applied, would be to use lichenometry or rock                         surface retreat for estimating the ages of petroglyphs, or the use of weathering zone growth rates and macro-wanes. There                         is thus considerable scope for extending the range of viable direct dating methods.                                                                                                                   Present indications of rock art ages suggest a significant increase of quantity during the early to mid-Holocene, perhaps                         7000 or 6000 years ago. Large corpora in arid regions begin simultaneously around that time, which is almost certainly a phenomenon                         of selective preservation rather than an indication of cultural practice. In temperate regions, large bodies of surviving                         rock art first appear by the Neolithic or Bronze Age, where local lithologies are suitable. More arid regions, weathering-resistant                         rock types and well-sheltered sites have sometimes preserved remnants of much older traditions. Therefore the temporal distribution                         of rock art is universally related to preservation issues, especially those of lithology and climate.                                                                                                                   While the scientific study of rock art may still be in its infancy, it is not limited to issues of antiquity. Investigations                         of the technology of rock art have involved several productive approaches, including the study of the tools used in making                         petroglyphs, of paint recipes, of microscopic inclusions found in paint residues, and of the sourcing of pigment materials.                         Nano-stratigraphy—the microscopic excavation of strata of paint residues, mineral accretions or weathering and patination                         zones—was first introduced in the 1970s, and has been developed to great sophistication already. Its principles are rather                         similar to those of archaeological stratigraphy, but its methods, obviously, are very different. To some extent, this method                         might even overcome the limitation of rock art being, in contrast to archaeological sediment strata, apparently two-dimensional.                                                                                                                   Various other issues have been explored by rock art science in recent decades, such as the establishment of criteria for the                         effective discrimination between humanly made rock marks and natural markings on rocks. This had previously been a major problem,                         resulting in hundreds of cases of misidentification of both types of rock markings. Most of these mistakes refer to petroglyphs                         and natural markings resembling them, but there are also a few prominent cases of pictogram misidentifications on record.                         One of the most promising areas of scientific investigation of rock art concerns the holistic analysis of its physical, cultural                         and cognitive contexts. This includes the examination, often by field microscopy, of traces related to the production of rock                         markings, especially in well-preserved condition (particularly in caves). The methods used closely resemble those of forensic                         science (matching of microscopic striae, identification of microscopic organic traces and so forth), and are designed to determine                         the gestures involved in making the rock art. Their results can be correlated with other evidence in the same context (e.g.                         subterranean mining of flint and possible medicinal use of speleothems, or probable indications of ritualistic behavior. Some                         examples of the latter are the intentional placing of cave bear bones or other objects, or the systematic marking of cave                         walls by deliberate activities not yielding rock art.).                                                                                                                   The interpretation of rock art                                                                                          Traditionally, the greatest preoccupation of rock art researchers has been to interpret the iconography of rock art, i.e.                         what it is thought to depict, its meaning and its cultural role in ancient societies. Stylistic sequences were based on this                         approach in most world regions, and were refined and honed by successive scholars. Its basis was the plethora of stylistic                         genres perceived by the leading researchers, often constructs of a tenuous nature.                                                                                                                   According to one of these models, the cave art of western Europe developed from the most simple to the most complex and ornate                         styles, from about 35,000 to 10,000 years ago. This fundamental tenet, and with it the stylistic chronology of Ice Age cave                         art, fell with the 1994 discovery of Chauvet Cave, and the subsequent dating of some of its ultra-sophisticated rock art to                         about 32,000 radiocarbon years (well over 35,000 sidereal years, due to the Campanian Ignimbrite event). This demonstrated                         the inexpedience of simplistic evolutionary schemes in the interpretation of Pleistocene art traditions.                                                                                                                   Moreover, there are significant limitations to our access to such intractable dimensions of rock art as its meaning. Most                         rock art motifs are not adequately detailed naturalistic depictions of objects to permit reliable identifications, and such                         pronouncements are almost never testable for pre-historic rock art. The only blind test ever conducted of the ability of an                         alien researcher to effectively identify meaning in rock art occurred in northern Australia in 1977. A professor of anatomy                         showed that he himself had misidentified 90% of a body of animal and human depictions at the site Beswick Cave, after he became                         aware that the artists were still alive. He also reported that to correctly associate and integrate individual motifs into                         a whole to express the purpose and thought context of the paintings was totally dependent upon direct cultural information.                         Such access is of course impossible to pre-historic cultures; therefore, it would be imprudent to rely on the “identifications”                         of scenes, figures or artistic intentions by contemporary scholars posing as experts. Our own perception does not define reality,                         and even less can it define the realities perceived in other cultures. Our interpretations are freestanding constructs involving                         autosuggestion, reflecting our interpreting intellect and perception. They are not necessarily false, but their veracity is                         untestable and on balance they need to be regarded as reflections of the way we interpret reality—which we need to assume                         differs from the reality construct, cognition, and visual or mental perception of the now mute rock artist.                                                                                                                   Valid ethnographic interpretation of rock art is very limited indeed, and is largely restricted to Australia, although a few                         isolated cases elsewhere are known. It has been given much less prominence than the fanciful interpretations of rock art by                         humanist scholars, which usually involve shamans, trance visions, space travelers, rituals, religion, head-hunting, cannibalism                         and a whole gamut of less entertaining variations. These interpretations provide insights into the perception, cognition,                         and cultural and academic conditioning of the interpreter. Because of the inadequate state of rock art dating we can in most                         cases not even know which period, culture and people the rock art in question is attributable to, yet often these tenuous                         interpretations are used as the basis of estimating rock art age.                                                                                                                   Other forms of rock art interpretation have been neglected but are more promising. For instance, semiotic analysis to examine                         the syntax of rock art seems viable, and the study of work traces and of contextualizing rock art within spatially related                         evidence of other activities is most promising in cave sites. This may include the reconstruction of the gestures involved                         in creating the rock art. Psychological interpretation, for example in terms of graphic universals, is likely to yield testable                         information. As in all areas of rock art research, there is much room for improvement, which is precisely what renders this                         discipline so exciting and promising.                                                                                                                   Rock art and semiotics                                                                                          Recently, a trend has become evident in rock art research to explore the cultural and cognitive development of humans through                         rock art, especially of the Pleistocene period. Cognitive evolution, informed by advances in neuroscience and psychology,                         is increasingly becoming relevant to the understanding of the earliest art. Pleistocene rock art and portable art-like productions                         can provide evidence that may help test particular models as to how human cognition may have developed. As research into cognition                         and neuroscience continues apace, rock art and other paleoart are becoming primary data sources in this quest. Underlying                         principles and universals need to be identified, and the available material of the Middle and Early Upper Pleistocene requires                         much more attention than has been evident in the 20th century. This reflects a change from traditional preoccupations to new                         approaches. It will endeavor to place Ice Age paleoart into the context of cognitive evolution, explore its semiotic dimensions,                         and consider implications for technology and culture during the Paleolithic period.                                                                                                                   In exploring our cognitive origins we need to appreciate that hominins did not become human through the natural processes                         that modified their skeletal architecture, but through processes enabling them to develop culture, cognition and technology                         on a scale removing humans far from all other primates in those areas. However, archaeologists and paleoanthropologists have                         provided us with a history of the human ascent that focuses very much on the physical evolution of hominins. By comparison,                         almost no effort has been directed towards learning about their cognitive and cultural evolution. It is therefore quite right                         to say that the reasons for humanization and the processes involved have so far barely been considered, and most certainly                         they have not been clarified. Culture is scientifically defined as the passing on of practice by non-genetic means (i.e. by                         learning), and is therefore practiced not only by humans, but also by many other animals, especially primates. “Biological                         intelligence” does not necessarily lead to a better grasp of objective reality for the species concerned. While it is true                         that intelligent forms of life must participate in a process that inevitably leads to the evolution of more intelligent forms                         of life, the improvements will always be in terms of their ability to enhance access to energy and nutrient resources, and                         to promote procreational potential, never in terms of facilitating a better grasp of reality. Genotypes determine the sensory                         faculties of an organism, and changes only occur within the confines of phenotypic plasticity. These abilities determine which                         material stimuli an organism can detect. Genes can also form neural circuitry that allows cross-referencing of sensory information,                         but the ability to construct conceptual models of reality, which defines “intelligence” biologically, is not itself genetically                         determined. Among highly advanced life forms, selection will favor organisms capable of the conceptual and behavioral innovations                         from which new behavioral modes can be constructed: the mental faculties, not their constructs, are the selective determinant.                         Similarly, cortical or speech-related structures are results, not causes, of evolutionary selection favoring speech (applied                         symbolism) or intelligence: a selection criterion needs to be established before it can affect phenotypic selection of genes.                                                                                                                   The introduction of phenomena consisting only of humanly perceptible variables, such as the production of symbolic surface                         markings, rendered perceived “reality” conceptually manageable, by providing complete rather than fragmentary sets of percepts.                         Visual and mental taxonomizing processes and the inclusion of the new neural structures in cybernetic feedback systems thus                         became available for selection. “Conscious experience”, or rather what we understand by it, became possible because the neural                         facilities prompted by earliest paleoart production became available for the processing of stimuli of the non-artificial material                         world, in a taxonomizing format.                                                                                                                   Human knowledge is thus derived from applying concept-building cognitive processes to external stimuli, i.e. sensory information,                         thus accumulating percepts. It is self-evident that human knowledge has a tendency of reinforcing itself through its own products,                         because it is continually validated and augmented by our material and cultural achievements. Cultural dynamics refer to the                         processes by which the intelligent organism alters its perceptible environment through its dialectic participation in the                         processes shaping it. Selection in favor of increased levels of “intelligence” is the inevitable outcome of such interaction                         among percepts, concepts and behavior patterns, but at no stage of this autonomous process is there any need for the concepts                         to be in tune with objective reality. Provided that the internally consistent logical framework is not challenged by it, there                         is no reason to assume that an entirely false, cultural cosmology or epistemological model could not be formed and maintained                         indefinitely by an intelligent species. Evolutionary success is irrelevant to the objective merits or validity of such models.                         The concepts of reality that have evolved in the course of hominin and human history have led to the one apparently held by                         all extant human populations. There is no reason to assume that these concepts could be particularly useful in exploring objective                         reality.                                                                                                                   The simplistic view that the animal figures in Ice Age art are cognitively more sophisticated than the often highly complex                         “geometric patterns” found in Pleistocene arts is easily refuted. If we separate art works into three-dimensional figurative,                         two-dimensional figurative and non-figurative genres, we see that the first is the least complex and the last the most complex.                         This is because in the first art genre, referent (the object depicted, the signified) and referrer (the art motif) are cognitively                         relatable by direct visual resemblance of certain characteristics. In graphic figurative art, the referent is related to the                         art motif through the projection of certain of its characteristics onto a two-dimensional plane, so the perception of its                         relationship to the referrer involves a decoding process requiring certain cognitive faculties. In entirely non-figurative                         arts as well as those that use highly “stylized” versions of iconicity it is impossible to know the referrer, unless one has                         direct access to the cultural conventions in question. Moreover, in the last-named art form, concepts or ideas involving no                         figuratively definable referents can readily be “depicted”. It is therefore clearly the semiotically most sophisticated art                         genre, and can communicate unlimited numbers of ideas, in rather the same way as written characters.                                                                                                                   This separation can be correlated broadly with the main stages of symbolic evolution. The Makapansgat cobble, an object almost                         three million years old, seems to indicate an early hominin ability to detect at least some aspects of iconicity, even if                         only at a “reflexive” level. It would then be reasonable to consider that subsequent hominins developed the capacity to detect                         iconic properties of natural objects (such as the Tan-Tan and Berekhat Ram pebbles). A predilection for abstracting three-dimensional                         likeness to graphic image apparently developed more recently, perhaps preceded by an ability to replicate two-dimensional                         imagery, such as phosphenes, fossil imprints and, in some traditions, eventually tracks. The use of non-iconic markings to                         form complex patterns of communicable meaning seems to originate in Middle Paleolithic traditions of Africa or Asia, on present                         evidence. This last art form, the most sophisticated, dominates in most of Upper Paleolithic Eurasia. Even in the western                         European cave art, “non-figurative” motifs far outnumber zoomorphs, and since they are almost certainly symbols of specific                         meanings, they are more semiotically complex than the usually favored animal figures. An animal picture, by itself, communicates                         very little by comparison, but it has been much more likely to attract scholarly attention. By Upper Paleolithic times, traditions                         of using non-iconic markings had become so sophisticated that they appear to have served for mnemonic, record-keeping or other                         exceedingly complex semiotic activities, e.g. in Russia and Siberia. Their vestiges have so far attracted only cursory attention                         and these traditions remain profoundly unknown.                                                                                                                   The semiotic dimensions of early rock art and other paleoarts thus remain under-explored, yet they could offer valuable insights                         into how we as a species formed constructs of reality and created our world. It is of utmost importance to the human species                         to develop this aspect of semiotic studies.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

Discuss this issue on the  talk page .  (November 2008)              Solar hot water panels for heating a swimming pool in the  Netherlands       Solar hot water  is water heated by the use of  solar energy .   Solar heating  systems are generally composed of solar  thermal  collectors, a  fluid  system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage. The system may use  electricity  for pumping the fluid, and have a reservoir or tank for heat storage and subsequent use. The systems may be used to heat water for a wide variety of uses, including home, business and industrial uses. Heating  swimming pools ,  underfloor heating  or energy input for  space heating  or  cooling  are more specific examples.   In many  climates , a solar heating system can provide up to 85% of domestic hot water energy. [ 1 ]  This can include domestic non-electric  concentrating solar thermal  systems. In many northern  European  countries, combined hot water and space heating systems ( solar combisystems ) are used to provide 15 to 25% of home heating energy.   In the southern regions of  Africa  like  Zimbabwe , solar water heaters have been gaining popularity, thanks to the  Austrian - [ 2 ]  and other  EU -funded projects that are promoting more environmentally friendly water heating solutions.   Residential solar thermal installations can be subdivided into two kinds of systems: compact and pumped systems. Both typically include an auxiliary energy source (electric heating element or connection to a gas or fuel oil central heating system) that is activated when the water in the tank falls below a minimum temperature setting such as 50  C . Hence, hot water is always available. The combination of solar hot water heating and using the back-up heat from a wood stove chimney to heat water [ 3 ]  can enable a hot water system to work all year round in cooler climates without the supplemental heat requirement of a solar hot water system being met with fossil fuels or electricity.   Among pumped options, there is an important distinction to be made regarding the sustainability of the design of the system. This relates to what source of energy powers the pump and its controls. The type of pumped solar thermal systems which use mains electricity to pump the fluid through the panels are called low carbon solar because the pumping negates the carbon savings of the solar by about 20%, according to data in a report called ""Side by side testing of eight solar water heatings"" by DTI UK. However, zero-carbon pumped solar thermal systems use solar electricity which is generated onsite using photovoltaics to pump the fluid and to operate its control electronics. This represents a zero operational carbon footprint and is becoming an important design goal for innovative solar thermal systems.

Levi Yissar  built the first prototype Israeli  solar water heater  and in 1953 he started NerYah Company, Israel's first commercial manufacturer of solar water heaters. [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  Due to the abundance of sunlight in  Israel , solar water heaters were used by some 20% of the population by 1967. Following the energy crisis in the 1970s, the Israeli  Knesset  passed a law requiring the installation of solar water heaters in all new homes (except high towers with insufficient roof area). As a result, Israel is now the world leader in the use of solar energy  per capita  (3% of the primary national energy consumption). [ 6 ]   During this time, there was some resurgence of interest in solar heating in  North America . Technical innovation has improved performance, life expectancy and ease of use of these systems. Installation of solar hot water heating has become the norm in countries with an abundance of solar radiation, like  Cyprus , Israel [ 7 ]  and  Greece , as well as in  Japan  and  Austria , where there is less.   Solar hot water systems have become popular in  China , where basic models start at around 1,500  yuan  ( US$ 190), much cheaper than in Western countries (around 80% cheaper for a given size of collector). It is said that at least 30 million Chinese households now have one, and that the popularity is due to the efficient evacuated tubes which allow the heaters to function even under gray skies and at temperatures well below freezing. [ 8 ]   In 2005,  Spain  became the first country in the world to require the installation of  photovoltaic  electricity generation in new buildings, and the second (after Israel) to require the installation of solar hot water systems. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Usage   Hot water heated by the sun can be used to:     Heat water (e.g. for sanitary purposes such as showering, washing, ...)   Generate electricity     Designs suitable for hot climates can be much simpler and cheaper, and can be considered an  appropriate technology  for these places. The global solar thermal market is dominated by  China ,  Europe ,  Japan  and  India .   The typical 50 gallon electric water heater uses 11.1 barrels of oil a year, which translates into the same amount oil used by a typical 4 door  sedan  driven by the average consumer.   Electric utility companies often provide electricity by burning and releasing energy from fuels such as  oil ,  coal  and  nuclear energy . An electrical home hot water heater sits on an  electrical grid  and may be driving the use of unclean fuels on the other end of the grid.     [ edit ]   Israel          Solar water heater on a rooftop in  Jerusalem       Israel 's use of solar water heaters is estimated to save the country two million  barrels of oil  a year, and the country has the highest per capita use in the world. [ 10 ] In the 1950s there was a fuel shortage in the new Israeli state, and the government forbid heating water between 10 p.m. and 6 p.m. As the situation worsened, engineer  Levi Yissar  proposed that instead of building more electrical generators, homes should switch to solar water heaters. He built a prototype in his home, and in 1953 he started NerYah Company, Israel's first commercial manufacturer of solar water heaters. [ 5 ]  By 1967 around one in twenty  households  heated their water with the sun and 50,000 solar heaters had been sold. [ 5 ]  However, cheap oil from Iran and from oil fields captured in the  Six Day War  made Israeli electricity cheaper and the demand for solar heaters dropped. [ 11 ]  With the  1970s oil crisis ,  Harry Zvi Tabor , the father of  Israel's solar industry , developed the prototype solar water heater that is now used in over 90% of Israeli homes. [ 12 ]   In 1980, the Israeli  Knesset  passed a law requiring the installation of solar water heaters in all new homes (except high towers with insufficient roof area). As a result, Israel is now the world leader in the use of solar energy  per capita  (3% of the primary national energy consumption). [ 13 ]   As of the early 1990s, all new residential buildings were required by the government to install solar water-heating systems, and Israel's National Infrastructure Ministry estimates solar panels for water-heating already satisfy 4% of the country's total energy demand. [ 12 ]  Israel and Cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90% of homes using them. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Technique          A thermodynamic water heater installed on a house in Belgium       In order to heat water using solar energy, a collector is fastened to the roof of a building, or on a wall facing the sun. In some cases, the collector may be free-standing. The  working fluid  is either pumped (active system) or driven by  natural convection  (passive system) through it.   The collector could be made of a simple  glass  topped  insulated  box with a flat solar absorber made of  sheet metal  attached to  copper  pipes and painted black, or a set of metal tubes surrounded by an evacuated (near  vacuum ) glass  cylinder . In some cases, before the solar energy is absorbed, a  parabolic   mirror  is used to concentrate sunlight on the tube. Some systems are capable of converting light to heat and therefore are not as reliant on outside temperature. [ 15 ]   A simple water heating system would pump cold water out to a collector to be heated, the heated water flows back to a collection  tank . This type of collector can provide enough hot water for an entire  family .   Heat is stored in a hot water tank. The volume of this tank will be larger with solar heating systems in order to allow for bad  weather , and because the  optimum  final temperature for the absorber is lower than a typical immersion or combustion  heater .   The working fluid for the  absorber  may be the hot water from the tank, but more commonly (at least in pumped systems) is a separate loop of fluid containing  anti-freeze  and a  corrosion inhibitor  which delivers heat to the tank through a  heat exchanger  (commonly a  coil  of copper tubing within the tank). Another lower-maintenance concept is the 'drain-back': no anti-freeze is required; instead all the  piping  is sloped to cause water to drain back to the tank. The tank is not  pressurized  and is open to  atmospheric pressure . As soon as the pump shuts off, flow reverses and the pipes empty by the time when  freezing  could occur.   When a solar hot water and hot-water central heating system are used in conjunction, solar heat will either be concentrated in a pre-heating tank that feeds into the tank heated by the  central heating , or the solar heat exchanger will be lower in the tank than the hotter one. However, the main need for central heating is at night when there is no sunlight and in winter when solar gain is lower. Therefore, solar water heating for washing and bathing is often a better application than central heating because supply and demand are better matched.   The water from the collector can reach very high temperatures in good sunshine, or if the pump fails. Designs should allow for relief of pressure and excess heat through a heat dump.     [ edit ]   Economics, energy and system costs          A  laundromat  in  California  with panels on the roof providing hot washing water.       In sunny, warm locations, where freeze protection is not necessary, a batch type solar hot water heater can be extremely cost effective. In higher latitudes, there are often additional design requirements for cold weather, which add to system complexity. This has the effect of increasing the  initial  cost (but not the  life-cycle  cost) of a solar hot water system, to a level much higher than a comparable hot water heater of the conventional type. When calculating the total cost to own and operate, a proper analysis will consider that solar energy is free, thus greatly reducing the operating costs, whereas other energy sources, such as gas and electricity, can be quite expensive over time. Thus, when the initial costs of a solar system are properly financed and compared with energy costs, then in many cases the total monthly cost of solar heat can be less than other more conventional types of hot water heaters (and also in conjunction with an existing hot water heater). In addition, federal and local incentives can be significant.   As an example, a 56 ft. 2  solar water heater can cost US $7,500, but that initial cost is reduced to just $3,300 in the US State of  Oregon  due to federal and state incentives. The system will save approximately US $230 per year, with a payback of 14 years. Lower payback periods are possible based on maximizing sun exposure. [ 16 ]  As energy prices rise, payback periods decrease. In cooler locations, solar heating used to be less efficient. Usable amounts of domestic hot water were only available in the summer months, on cloudless days, between April and October. During the winter and on cloudy days, the output was poor. Independent surveys have shown that modern systems do not suffer these limitations. [ 17 ]  There are cases of households in cool climates getting all of their domestic hot water year round from solar alone. [ 18 ]  Systems have been show to efficiently work as far north as  Whitehorse, Yukon  ( latitude  of 60 B 43' N ). [ 19 ]   The installation costs in the  UK  used to be prohibitive, on average about   9,000. This is reduced in more recent years to 3,000, with payback period reduced, with the rise in the gas price, to 12 years  [ 20 ] . As energy prices rise, payback periods shorten accordingly.   According to  ANRE  (a  Flemish  energy agency, subsidised by the Flemish or  Belgian  government, [ 21 ]  a complete,  commercial  (active) solar hot water system composed of a solar collector (3-4 m; this is large enough for 4 people), pipes and tank (again large enough for 4 people) costs around 4000  euro . The installation by a recognised worker costs another 800 euro. [ 22 ]   Electrabel 's home magazine  Eandismagazine  stated in 2008 that a complete system (including 4m 2  of solar collectors and a supply barrel of 200-240 liters) to cost 4500 euro.  [ 23 ]  The system would then pay back itself in 11 years , when the returns are weighed off against a regular  electric   boiler . Calculation was as follows: a saving of 1875  kWh  (which is 50% of the energy requirements in domestic hot water production) x 0.10 euro/kWh = 187, 5 euros. This multiplied by 11.6 years made 2175 euros (or the cost of the system with deducted regional  tax  benefits).   In  Australia , the cost for an average solar hot water system fully installed is between $1,800 and $2,800. This is after  tax rebates  (there is a federal rebate, [ 24 ]  some state rebates and Renewable Energy Certificates [ 25 ] ). According to the Department of Environment and Water Resources [ 26 ] , the yearly electricity savings are between $300 and $700. This brings the payback period to under 2 years in the best case and under 10 years in the worst case.  Easy Being Green  has a program available where consumers can acquire a system for free (with government rebates) excluding the cost of installation.          A monobloc solar heater in  Cirque de Mafate ,  La Runion         [ edit ]   Types   Solar hot water systems can be classified in different ways:     The type of collector used (see below)   The location of the collector - roof mount, ground mount, wall mount [ 27 ]   The location of the storage tank in relation to the collector   The requirement for a pump - active vs. passive   The method of  heat transfer  - open-loop or closed-loop (via heat exchanger)       [ edit ]   Compact systems (passive systems)   A compact system also known as a  monobloc  has a tank for the heated water and a solar collector mounted on the same chasis. Typically these systems will function by natural convection ( thermosiphon ) or heatpipes to transfer the heat energy from the collector to the tank.          A integrated collector storage system       A special type of compact system is the Integrated Collector Storage (ICS or Batch Heater) where the tank acts as both storage and solar collector. Batch heaters are basically thin rectilinear tanks with glass in front of it generally in or on house wall or roof. They are seldom pressurised and usually depend on gravity flow to deliver their water. They are simple, efficient and less costly than intense plate and tube collectors but only suitable in moderate climates with good sunshine.  [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  A step up from the ICS is the  Convection Heat Storage Unit . These are plate type intense collectors with built-in insulated tanks. The unit uses convection (movement of hot water upward) to move the water from heater to tank. Neither pumps or electricity are used. It is more efficient than an ICS as the intense collector heats a small(er) amount of water that is constantly rising to the tank. It can be used in areas with less sunshine than the ICS.   Another system is the  Copper Cricket .  [ 30 ] [ 31 ]  The Copper Cricket is a special system which can be implemented into an existing (e.g. electric) hot water heater. It is manufactured by companies such as  Sage Advance Corporation .  [ 32 ]  The device works without any pumps or electricity. [ 33 ] [ 34 ]          A passive open loop system       Direct  ('open loop') compact systems, if made of metals are not suitable for cold climates. At night the remaining water can freeze and damage the panels, and the storage tank is exposed to the outdoor temperatures that will cause excessive heat losses on cold days. Some compact systems have a  primary circuit . The primary circuit includes the collectors and the external part of the tank. Instead of water, a non-toxic antifreeze is used. When this liquid is heated up, it flows to the external part of the tank and transfers the heat to the water placed inside. ('closed loop'). However, direct ('open loop') systems are slightly cheaper and more efficient.   A compact system can save up to 4.5  tonnes  annually of  greenhouse gas emissions . In order to achieve the aims of the  Kyoto Protocol , several countries are offering subsidies to the end user. Some systems can work for up to 25 years with minimum maintenance. These kinds of systems can be redeemed in six years, and achieve a positive balance of energy (energy used to build them minus energy they save) of 1.5 years. Most part of the year, when the electric heating element is not working, these systems do not use any external source for power (as water flows due to thermosiphon principle).   Flat  solar thermal collectors  are usually used, but compact systems using vacuum tube collectors are available on the market. These generally give a higher heat yield per square meter in colder climates but cost more than flat plate collector systems.     [ edit ]   Pumped systems (active systems)          Schematic of an active solar heating system              Schematic of an active solar heating system       How the solar water heating system is pumped and controlled determines whether it is a zero carbon or a low carbon system. Low carbon systems principally use electricity to circulate the fluid through the collector. The use of electricity typically reduces the carbon savings of a system by 10% to 20%.   Conventional low carbon system designs use a mains powered circulation pump whenever the hot water tank is positioned below the solar panels. Most systems in northern Europe are of this type. The storage tank is placed inside the building, and thus requires a controller that measures when the water is hotter in the panels than in the tank. The system also requires a pump for transferring the fluid between the parts. [ 35 ]   The electronic controllers used by some systems permit a wide range of functionality such as measurement of the energy produced; more sophisticated safety functions; thermostatic and time-clock control of auxiliary heat, hot water circulation loops, or others; display or transfer of error messages or alarms; remote display panels; and remote or local datalogging.   Newer zero carbon solar water heating systems are powered by solar electric (photovoltaic or PV) pumps. These typically use a 5-20W PV panel which faces in the same direction as the main solar heating panel and a small, low power  diaphragm pump  or centrifugal pump to circulate the water.   The most commonly used solar collector is the insulated glazed flat panel. Less expensive panels, like polypropylene panels (for swimming pools) or higher-performing ones like  evacuated tube  collectors, are sometimes used.     [ edit ]   Types of thermal collector             It has been suggested that this article or section be  merged  into  Solar thermal collector . ( Discuss )       There are three main kinds of  solar thermal collectors  in common use. In order of increasing cost they are: Formed Plastic Collectors, Flat Collectors, and Evacuated Tube Collectors. The efficiency of the system is directly related to heat losses from the collector surface (efficiency being defined as the proportion of heating energy that can be usefully obtained from insulation). Heat losses are predominantly governed by the thermal gradient between the temperature of the collector surface and the ambient temperature. Efficiency decreases when either the ambient temperature falls or as the collector temperature increases. This decrease in efficiency can be mitigated by increasing the insulation of the unit by sealing the unit in glass e.g. flat collectors or providing a vacuum seal e.g. evacuated tube collector. The choice of collector is determined by the heating requirements and environmental conditions in which it is employed. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ]   [ 39 ] [ 40 ]     [ edit ]   Formed plastic collector   Formed plastic collectors (such as  polypropylene ,  EPDM  or  PET   plastics ) consist of tubes or formed panels through which water is circulated and heated by the sun's radiation. These are often used for extending the swimming season in swimming pools. In some countries, heating an open-air swimming pool with non-renewable energy sources is not allowed, and then these inexpensive systems offer a good solution. This panel is not suitable for year-round uses like providing hot water for home use, primarily due to its lack of insulation which reduces its effectiveness greatly when the ambient air temperature is lower than the temperature of the fluid being heated.     [ edit ]   Flat plate collector          A flat plate collector       A flat plate collector consists of a thin absorber sheet (of thermally stable polymers, aluminum, steel or  copper , to which a black or selective coating is applied) backed by a grid or coil of fluid tubing and placed in an insulated casing with a glass or polycarbonate cover.   Fluid is circulated, using either mains or solar electricity, through the tubing to remove the heat from the absorber and to transport it to an insulated water tank, sometimes directly or otherwise to a  heat exchanger  or to some other device for using the heated fluid. Some fabricants have a completely flooded absorber consisting of 2 sheets of metal stamped to produce a circulation zone. Because the heat exchange area is greater they may be marginally more efficient than traditional absorbers. [ 41 ]   As an alternative to metal collectors, new polymer flat plate collectors are now being produced in Europe. These may be wholly  polymer , or they may be metal plates behind which are freeze-tolerant water channels made of silicone rubber instead of metal. Polymers, being flexible and therefore freeze-tolerant, are able to contain plain water instead of antifreeze, so that in some cases they are able to plumb directly into existing water tanks instead of needing the tank to be replaced with one using heat exchangers. By dispensing with a heat exchanger in these flat plate panel, temperatures need not be quite so high for the circulation system to be switched on, so such direct circulation panels, whether polymer or otherwise, can be somewhat more efficient, particularly at low light levels.   As with evacuated tubes, most flat plate collectors have a life expectancy of over 25 years.     [ edit ]   Evacuated tube collector          Evacuated (or vacuum) tubes panel.       Evacuated tube collectors are made of a series of modular tubes, mounted in parallel, whose number can be added to or reduced as hot water delivery needs change. This type of collector consists of rows of parallel transparent glass tubes, each of which contains an absorber tube (in place of the absorber plate to which metal tubes are attached in a flat-plate collector). In some cases, the tubes are covered with a special light-modulating coating. In an evacuated tube collector, sunlight passing through an outer glass tube heats the absorber tube contained within it. The absorber can either consist of copper (glass-metal) or specially-coated glass tubing (glass-glass). The glass-metal evacuated tubes are typically sealed at the manifold end, and the absorber is actually sealed in the vacuum, thus the fact that the absorber and heat pipe are dissimilar metals creates no corrosion problems. Some systems use foam insulation in the manifold. Soda-lime glass is used in the higher quality evacuated tubes manufacture.   Lower quality evacuated tube systems use the glass coated absorber. Due to the extreme temperature difference of the glass under stagnation temperatures, the glass sometimes shatters. The glass is a lower quality boron silicate material and the aluminum absorber and copper heat pipe are slid down inside the open top end of the tube. Moisture entering the manifold around the sheet metal casing is eventually absorbed by the glass fibre insulation and then finds its way down into the tubes. This leads to corrosion at the absorber/heat pipe interface area, also freeze ruptures of the tube itself if the tube fills sufficiently with water.   Two types of tube collectors are distinguished by their heat transfer method: the simplest pumps a heat transfer fluid (water or  antifreeze ) through a U-shaped copper tube placed in each of the glass collector tubes. The second type uses a sealed  heat pipe  that contains a liquid that vapourises as it is heated. The vapour rises to a heat-transfer bulb that is positioned outside the collector tube in a pipe through which a second heat transfer liquid (the water or antifreeze) is pumped. For both types, the heated liquid then circulates through a heat exchanger and gives off its heat to water that is stored in a storage tank (which itself may be kept warm partially by sunlight). Evacuated tube collectors heat to higher temperatures, with some models providing considerably more solar yield per square metre than flat panels. However, they are more expensive and fragile than flat panels. Evacuated heat tubes perform better than flat plate collectors in cold climates because they only rely on the light they receive and not the outside temperature. [ 42 ]  The high stagnation temperatures can cause antifreeze to break down, so careful consideration must be used if selecting this type of system in temperate climates.Tubes come in different levels of quality so the different kinds have to be examined as well. High quality units can efficiently absorb diffuse solar radiation present in cloudy conditions and are unaffected by wind. They also have the same performance in similar light conditions summer and winter. [ 43 ]   For a given absorber area, evacuated tubes can maintain their efficiency over a wide range of ambient temperatures and heating requirements. The absorber area only occupied about 50% of the collector panel on early designs, however this has changed as the technology has advanced to maximize the absorption area. In extremely hot climates, flat-plate collectors will generally be a more cost-effective solution than evacuated tubes. When employed in arrays of 20 to 30 or more, the efficient but costly evacuated tube collectors have net benefit in winter and also give real advantage in the summer months. They are well suited to extremely cold ambient temperatures and work well in situations of consistently low-light. They are also used in industrial applications, where high water temperatures or steam need to be generated. Properly designed evacuated tubes have a life expectancy of over 25 years which greatly adds to their value.     [ edit ]   Solar thermal cooling       Main article:  Solar thermal cooling       Solar thermal cooling  can be achieved via  absorption refrigeration cycles ,  desiccant  cycles and solar-mechanical processes. [ 44 ]   The absorption cycle solar cooling system works like a  refrigerator  in that it uses hot water to compress a gas that, once expanded, will absorb energy, which cools the air. The main problem currently is that the absorber machine works with liquid at 90 C, a fairly high temperature to be reached with pumped solar panels with no auxiliary power supply. [ citation needed ]   The same pumped solar thermal installation can be used for producing hot water for the whole year. It can also be used for cooling in the summer and partially heating the building in winter.     [ edit ]   DIY systems   With an ever-rising  do-it-yourself -community and their increasing environmental awareness, people have begun building their own (small-scale) solar hot water systems from scratch or buying easy to install kits. Plans for solar hot water systems are available on the  Internet . [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ]  and people have set about building them for their own domestic requirements. DIY solar hot water systems are usually much cheaper than commercial ones, and installation costs can sometimes be avoided as well. The DIY-solar hot water systems are being used both in the developed world, as in the developing world, to generate hot water. [ 50 ]  Rather than build systems from scratch, many DIY solar enthusiasts are buying simple off-the-shelf solar DIY kits. In particular the new freeze tolerant, zero-carbon PV pumped systems, are becoming common in parts of Europe, since their simplicity enables them to be plumbed in quickly and safely without the need of a mains electrician.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

The grand idea is to have a membership site where all membership dues are donated to community projects that involve the use and implementation of both solar and wind energy solutions.    A place when together the community can decide what projects are worthwhile and which projects we can fund that will changes the lives of individuals now and make the world a cleaner place for our children and theirs.    These goals will require people from all over the world from different backgrounds and places.     If you believe that you would like to be a part of something bigger than yourself and would like to help there are a number of ways to help me get this site off the ground.    First if you have a background in solar or wind energy and would like to contribute articles for the site please sign up and start submitting as soon as you can.    If you have a website of your own then please link to us.    You can become active on the community forum which will encourage others to become active.    You can leave comments on any of the articles you see on the site, that also encourages participation.    Lastly when we have a community of people and turn the site into a membership site you can join and help us all determine where we as a community can make the biggest difference.     There is no question in my mind that we will succeed despite the pressures of large corporations.    And there is no doubt that one small community of people who actually want to do more than talk about problems can make the changes necessary to make the world a better place for all of us to live.    Welcome and please make any contribution you can to help this movement grow.

Solar cells have been converting energy for quite a long time now however technology is just now allowing many people to use solar energy to power bigger things like their homes. The reason this method of getting electricity is gaining more and more support is not only because of technology but people see the many benefits of using solar power. The creation of solar cells is a very complicated process however how they work is rather easy to understand.

Solar heaters have to have certain things to work right. They must have  solar thermal collectors, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage and subsequent use. The systems may be used to heat water for home or business use, for swimming pools, under floor heating or as an energy input for space heating and cooling and industrial applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Solar Power Panels                                                                                         Read more...                                                                                                                                                            Written by  Ace ,                                                                                                                                Views : 187                                                                                      Published in :  Solar ,   Residential Solar                                         Tags :  Solar ,  Residential Solar ,  Solar Power Panels                                          I have been trying to figure out how to justify putting solar power panels on my house for about five years.    I keep hoping that the price will fall or a new technology will come out that could justify the expense.    I really want to live off grid but every time I do the calculations the numbers just don’t add up.    First of all there is a finite life span to the Silicon solar power panels that are being produced today.    They have a 25 year guarantee but it is also made clear that they will drop off in production of electricity over the course of time.    So the rating they have at day one will decrease every year they are installed until they eventually give out completely.

These  ecological effects of biodiversity  in turn affect both  climate change  through enhanced  greenhouse gases ,  aerosols  and loss of land cover, and biological diversity, causing a rapid loss of  ecosystems  and  extinctions  of  species  and local populations. The current rate of extinction is sometimes considered a  mass extinction , with current species extinction rates on the order of 100 to 1000 times as high as in the past. [ 1 ]   The two main areas where the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function have been studied are the relationship between diversity and productivity, and the relationship between diversity and community stability. More biologically diverse communities appear to be more productive (in terms of  biomass  production) than are less diverse communities, and they appear to be more stable in the face of perturbations.   Also animals that inhabit an area may alter the surviving conditions by factors assimilated by climate.

Biodiversity is not easily defined, but may be thought of as the number and/or evenness of  genes , species, and ecosystems in a  region . This definition includes  genetic diversity , or the diversity of genes within a species,  species diversity , or the diversity of species within a  habitat  or region, and ecosystem diversity, or the diversity of habitats within a region.   Two things commonly measured in relation to changes in diversity are productivity and  stability . Productivity is a measure of ecosystem function. It is generally measured by taking the total aboveground  biomass  of all plants in an area. Many assume that it can be used as a general indicator of ecosystem function and that total resource use and other indicators of ecosystem function are correlated with productivity.   Stability is much more difficult to define, but can be generally thought of in two ways. General stability of a population is a measure that assumes stability is higher if there is less of a chance of extinction. This kind of stability is generally measured by measuring the  variability  of aggregate community properties, like total biomass, over time  [ 2 ]  The other definition of stability is a measure of resilience and resistance, where an ecosystem that returns quickly to an  equilibrium  after a perturbation or resists invasion is thought of as more stable than one that doesn't. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Productivity and stability as indicators of ecosystem health   The importance of stability in community ecology is clear. An unstable ecosystem will be more likely to lose species. Thus, if there is indeed a link between diversity and stability, it is likely that losses of diversity could feedback on themselves, causing even more losses of species. Productivity, on the other hand, has a less clear importance in community ecology. In managed areas like  cropland , and in areas where animals are grown or caught, increasing productivity increases the  economic  success of the area and implies that the area has become more efficient, leading to possible long term resource  sustainability . [ 4 ]  It is more difficult to find the importance of productivity in natural ecosystems. This will be discussed in more detail later.     [ edit ]   Does biodiversity have value?   Beyond the value biodiversity has in regulating and stabilizing ecosystem processes, there are direct economic consequences of losing diversity in certain ecosystems and in the world as a whole. Losing species means losing potential  foods ,  medicines , industrial products, and  tourism , all of which have a direct economic effect on peoples lives. [ 5 ]  For more information, see the  economic role of biodiversity .     [ edit ]   Effects of diversity on community productivity     [ edit ]   How species diversity may influence productivity     Complementarity  Plant species coexistence is thought to be the result of  niche  partitioning, or differences in resource requirements among species. By complementarity, a more diverse plant community should be able to use resources more completely, and thus be more productive. [ 4 ] [ 6 ]  Also called niche differentiation, this mechanism is a central principle in the  functional group  approach, which breaks species diversity down into functional components.  [ 7 ] [ 8 ]   Facilitation   Facilitation  is a mechanism whereby certain species help or allow other species to grow by modifying the environment in a way that is favorable to a co-occurring species. [ 9 ]  Plants can interact through an intermediary like nitrogen, water, temperature, space, or interactions with weeds or herbivores among others. Some examples of facilitation include large desert perennials acting as nurse plants, aiding the establishment of young neighbors of other species by alleviating water and temperature stress, [ 10 ]  and nutrient enrichment by nitrogen-fixers such as legumes.   The Sampling Effect  The sampling effect of diversity can be thought of as having a greater chance of including a species of greatest inherent productivity in a plot that is more diverse. This provides for a composition effect on productivity, rather than diversity being a direct cause. However, the sampling effect may in fact be a compilation of different effects. The sampling effect can be separated into the greater likelihood of selecting a species that is 1) adapted well to particular site conditions, or 2) of a greater inherent productivity. Additionally, one can add to the sampling effect a greater likelihood of including 3) a pair of species that highly complement each other, or 4) a certain species with a large facilitative effect on other members of the community.       [ edit ]   Review of data   Field experiments to test the degree to which diversity affects community productivity have found many things, but many long term studies in  grassland  ecosystems have found that diversity does indeed enhance the productivity of ecosystems.  [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   [ 13 ]  Evidence of the relationship has also been found in grassland microcosms. However, these different studies have come to different conclusions as to whether the cause was due more to diversity or to species composition. Recent mathematical models have highlighted the importance of ecological context in unraveling this problem. Some models have indicated the importance of  disturbance  rates and spatial  heterogeneity  of the environment, [ 14 ]  others have indicated that the time since disturbance and the habitat's carrying capacity can cause differing relationships. [ 15 ]  Each ecological context should yield not only a different relationship, but a different contribution to the relationship due to diversity and to composition.     [ edit ]   Implications for ecology/future research   In order to correctly identify the consequences of diversity on productivity and other ecosystem processes, many things must happen. First, it is imperative that scientists stop looking for a single relationship. It is obvious now from the models, the data, and the theory that there is no one overarching effect of diversity on productivity. Scientists must try to quantify the differences between composition effect and diversity effects, as many experiments never quantify the final realized species diversity (instead only counting numbers of species of seeds planted) and confound a sampling effect for facilitators (a compositional factor) with diversity effects.   Relative amounts of  overyielding  (or how much more a species grows when grown with other species than it does in monoculture) should be used rather than absolute amounts as relative overyielding can give clues as to the mechanism by which diversity is influencing productivity, however if experimental protocols are incomplete, one may be able to indicate the existence of a complementary or facilitative effect in the experiment, but not be able to recognize its cause. Experimenters should know what the goal of their experiment is, that is, whether it is meant to inform natural or managed ecosystems, as the sampling effect may only be a real effect of diversity in natural ecosystems (managed ecosystems are composed to maximize complementarity and facilitation regardless of species number). By knowing this, they should be able to choose spatial and temporal scales that are appropriate for their experiment. Lastly, to resolve the diversity-function debate, it is advisable that experiments be done with large amounts of spatial and resource heterogeneity and environmental fluctuation over time, as these types of experiments should be able to demonstrate the diversity-function relationship more easily. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Effects of diversity on community stability     [ edit ]   How species diversity may influence community stability     Averaging Effect  If all species have differential responses to changes in the ecosystem over time, then the averaging of these responses will cause a more temporally stable ecosystem if more species are in the ecosystem. [ 2 ] . This effect is a  statistical  effect due to summing  random   variables .   Negative Covariance Effect  If some species do better when other species are not doing well, then when there are more species in the ecosystem, their overall  variance  will be lower than if there were fewer species in the system. This lower variance indicates higher stability.  [ 16 ]  This effect is a consequence of  competition  as highly competitive species will negatively  covary .   Insurance Effect  If an ecosystem contains more species then it will have a greater likelihood of having  redundant  stabilizing species, and it will have a greater number of species that respond differently to perturbations. This will enhance an ecosystem's ability to  buffer  perturbations. [ 17 ]   Resistance to Invasion  Diverse communities may use resources more completely than simple communities because of a diversity effect for complementarity. Thus  invaders  may have reduced success in diverse ecosystems, or there may be a reduced likelihood that an invading species will introduce a new property or process to a diverse ecosystem. [ 18 ]   [ 8 ]   [ 19 ]   Resistance to Disease  A decreased number of competing plant species may allow the abundances of other species to increase, facilitating the spread of diseases of those species.  [ 18 ]   [ 19 ]   [ 20 ]       [ edit ]   Review of temporal stability data   Models have predicted that  empirical  relationships between  temporal  variation of community productivity and species diversity are indeed real, and that they almost have to be. Some temporal stability data can be almost completely explained by the averaging effect by constructing null models to test the data against. [ 2 ] [ 11 ]  Competition, which causes negative covariances, only serves to strengthen these relationships.     [ edit ]   Review of resistance/resilience stability data   This area is more contentious than the area of temporal stability, mostly because some have tried generalizing the findings of the temporal stability models and theory to stability in general. While the relationship between temporal variations in productivity and diversity has a mathematical cause, which will allow the relationship to be seen much more often than not, it is not the case with resistance/resilience stability. Some experimenters have seen a  correlation  between diversity and reduced invasibility, though many have also seen the opposite.  [ 21 ]  The correlation between diversity and disease is also tenuous, though theory and data do seem to support it. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Implications for ecology/future research   In order to more fully understand the effects of diversity on the temporal stability of ecosystems it is necessary to recognize that they are bound to occur. By constructing null models to test the data against (as in Doak et al. 1998 [ 2 ] ) it becomes possible to find situations and ecological contexts where ecosystems become more or less stable than they should be. Finding these contexts would allow for mechanistic studies into why these ecosystems are more stable, which may allow for applications in  conservation  management.   More importantly more complete experiments into whether diverse ecosystems actually resist invasion and disease better than their less diverse equivalents as invasion and disease are two important factors that lead to species extinctions in the present day.     [ edit ]   Theory and preliminary effects from examining food webs   One major problem with both the diversity-productivity and diversity-stability debates discussed up to this point is that both focus on interactions at just a single  trophic level . That is, they are concerned with only one level of the  food web , namely plants. Other research, unconcerned with the effects of diversity, has demonstrated strong top-down forcing of ecosystems (see  keystone species ). There is very little actual data available regarding the effects of different food webs, but theory helps us in this area. First, if a food web in an ecosystem has a lot of weak  interactions  between different species, then it should have more stable populations and the community as a whole should be more stable. [ 3 ]  If upper levels of the web are more diverse, then there will be less  biomass  in the lower levels and if lower levels are more diverse they will better be able to resist  consumption  and be more stable in the face of consumption. Also, top-down forcing should be reduced in less diverse ecosystems because of the bias for species in higher trophic levels to go extinct first. [ 22 ]  Lastly, it has recently been shown that  consumers  can dramatically change the biodiversity-productivity-stability relationships that are implied by plants alone. [ 23 ]  Thus, it will be important in the future to incorporate food web theory into the future study of the effects of biodiversity. In addition this complexity will need to be addressed when designing biodiversity management plans.     [ edit ]   Conclusions   It is imperative that we come to a realization that there is no single overarching effect of diversity on either productivity or stability. The realized effects will depend heavily on environmental context and the time scale over which the effects are studied. However, it has become obvious that biodiversity is indeed important for both managed and natural ecosystems, though the relative contributions of diversity and composition remain unclear. It is therefore necessary for legislators to understand the basic science in order to maintain diversity at its current levels. If current human growth and resource management patterns do not change, it is likely that we will lose many important species, and the ecosystems of the world may never recover.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common source of  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon  burning in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The reason for  Mars 's red color is thought to be an iron-oxide-rich soil.     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or austenite. At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. They are used for structural purposes, as their alloy content raises their cost and necessitates justification of their use. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron -- which binds non-specifically to many cellular components -- can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables (haem iron), [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidizes readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes   Main article:  Allotropes of iron   Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallizes at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .

Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth.

Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy          The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore   See also:  Iron ore          Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace   Main article:  Blast furnace          Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes   Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks   Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content, the higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes   Main article:  Isotopes of iron   Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b       Main article:  Human iron metabolism   Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption, high blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.

They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and  history  of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is important for  mineral  and  hydrocarbon  extraction,  geotechnical engineering  and the mitigation of  natural hazards , and knowledge about  past climate  and  climate change , as well as being a major  academic  discipline.

The science was not included in  Encyclopdia Britannica 's  third edition completed in 1797, but had a lengthy entry in the fourth edition completed by 1809. [ 1 ]  An older meaning of the word was first used by  Richard de Bury  to distinguish between earthly and  theological  jurisprudence.     [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of geology              A mosquito and a fly in this  Baltic  amber necklace are between 40 and 60 million years old       The work  Peri Lithon  ( On Stones ) by the  ancient Greek  scholar  Theophrastus  (372-287 BC), a student of ancient  Greek  philosopher  Aristotle , remained authoritative for millennia.  Peri Lithon  was translated into Latin and some other foreign languages. Its interpretation of fossils was the most dominant theory in  classical Antiquity  and the  early Middle Ages , until it was replaced by  Avicenna 's theory of  petrifying  fluids ( succus lapidificatus ) in the  late Middle Ages . [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  In the  Roman  period,  Pliny the Elder  produced a very extensive discussion of many more minerals and metals then widely used for practical ends. He is among the first to correctly identify the origin of  amber  as a  fossilized   resin  from pine trees by the observation of insects trapped within some pieces. He also laid the basis of  crystallography  by recognising the  octahedral  habit of diamond.   Some modern scholars, such as  Fielding H. Garrison , are of the opinion that modern geology began in the  medieval Islamic world . [ 4 ]   Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni  (973-1048 AD) was one of the earliest  Muslim geologists , whose works included the earliest writings on the  geology of India , hypothesizing that the  Indian subcontinent  was once a sea. [ 5 ]   Ibn Sina  (Avicenna, 981-1037), in particular, made significant contributions to geology and the natural sciences (which he called  Attabieyat ) along with other natural philosophers such as  Ikhwan AI-Safa  and many others. He wrote an encyclopaedic work entitled  Kitab al-Shifa  (the Book of Cure, Healing or Remedy from ignorance), in which Part 2, Section 5, contains his essay on Mineralogy and Meteorology, in six chapters: Formation of mountains, The advantages of mountains in the formation of clouds; Sources of water; Origin of earthquakes; Formation of minerals; The diversity of earths  terrain . These principles were later known in the  Renaissance  of  Europe  as the  law of superposition  of strata, the concept of  catastrophism , and the doctrine of  uniformitarianism . These concepts were also embodied in the Theory of the Earth by  James Hutton  in the Eighteenth century C.E. Academics such as  Toulmin  and  Goodfield  (1965), commented on Avicenna's contribution: ""Around A.D. 1000, Avicenna was already suggesting a hypothesis about the origin of mountain ranges, which in the Christian world, would still have been considered quite radical eight hundred years later"". [ 6 ]  Avicenna's  scientific methodology  of  field observation  was also original in the Earth sciences, and remains an essential part of modern geological investigations. [ 3 ]   In China, the  polymath   Shen Kua  (1031-1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological  stratum  in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by  deposition  of  silt .           William Smith 's  geologic map  of  England ,  Wales , and southern  Scotland . Completed in 1815, it was the first national-scale geologic map, and by far the most accurate of its time. [ 7 ]       Georg Agricola  (1494-1555), a physician, wrote the first systematic treatise about  mining  and  smelting  works,  De re metallica  libri XII , with an appendix  Buch von den Lebewesen unter Tage  (Book of the Creatures Beneath the Earth). He covered subjects like wind energy,  hydrodynamic power , melting cookers, transport of ores, extraction of  soda ,  sulfur  and  alum , and administrative issues. The book was published in 1556.   Nicolas Steno  (1638-1686) is credited with the  law of superposition , the  principle of original horizontality , and the  principle of lateral continuity : three defining principles of  stratigraphy . Previous attempts at such statements met accusations of heresy from the Church. [ citation needed ]   By the 1700s  Jean-tienne Guettard  and  Nicolas Desmarest  hiked central France and recorded their observations on  geological maps ; Guettard recorded the first observation of the  volcanic  origins of this part of France.   William Smith  (1769-1839) drew some of the first geological maps and began the process of ordering  rock strata  (layers) by examining the fossils contained in them. [ 7 ]   James Hutton  is often viewed as the first modern geologist. [ 8 ]  In 1785 he presented a paper entitled  Theory of the Earth  to the  Royal Society of Edinburgh . In his paper, he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for  sediments  to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 ( Vol. 1 ,  Vol. 2 ).           The geologist , 19th century painting by  Carl Spitzweg .       Followers of Hutton were known as  Plutonists  because they believed that some rocks were formed by  vulcanism  which is the deposition of lava from volcanoes, as opposed to the  Neptunists , who believed that all rocks had settled out of a large ocean whose level gradually dropped over time.   In 1811  Georges Cuvier  and  Alexandre Brongniart  published their explanation of the antiquity of the Earth, inspired by Cuvier's discovery of fossil elephant bones in Paris. To prove this, they formulated the principle of  stratigraphic  succession of the layers of the earth. They were independently anticipated by  William Smith's  stratigraphic studies on  England  and  Scotland .   Sir Charles Lyell  first published his famous book,  Principles of Geology [ 9 ] , in 1830. Lyell continued to publish new revisions until he died in 1875. The book, which influenced the thought of  Charles Darwin , successfully promoted the doctrine of  uniformitarianism . This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the  Earth's history  and are still occurring today. In contrast,  catastrophism  is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.          Plate tectonics -  seafloor spreading  and  continental drift  illustrated on relief globe of the  Field Museum       19th century geology revolved around the question of the  Earth's exact age . Estimates varied from a few 100,000 to billions of years. [ 10 ]  The most significant advance in 20th century geology has been the development of the theory of  plate tectonics  in the 1960s. Plate tectonic theory arose out of two separate geological observations:  seafloor spreading  and  continental drift . The theory revolutionized the  Earth sciences .   The theory of continental drift was proposed by  Frank Bursley Taylor  in 1908, expanded by  Alfred Wegener  in 1912 and by  Arthur Holmes , but wasn't broadly accepted until the late 1960s when the theory of plate tectonics was developed.     [ edit ]   Important principles in the Development of Geology   There are a number of important principles that were developed near the beginning of geology as a formal science. Many of these involve the ability to provide the relative ages of strata or the manner in which they were formed. These principles are still often used today as a means to provide information about geologic history and the timing of geologic events.   The principle of intrusive relationships  concerns crosscutting  intrusions . In geology, when an  igneous  intrusion cuts across a formation of  sedimentary rock , it can be determined that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock. There are a number of different types of intrusions, including stocks,  laccoliths ,  batholiths ,  sills  and  dikes .   The  principle of cross-cutting relationships  pertains to the formation of  faults  and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a  normal fault  or a  thrust fault .   The  principle of inclusions and components  states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or  clasts ) are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when  xenoliths  are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as  magma  or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them.   The  principle of uniformitarianism  states that the geologic processes observed in operation that modify the Earth's crust at present have worked in much the same way over geologic time. A fundamental principle of geology advanced by the 18th century Scottish physician and geologist  James Hutton , is that ""the present is the key to the past."" In Hutton's words: ""the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be seen to be happening now.""   The  principle of original horizontality  states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of environments supports this generalization (although  cross-bedding  is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded units is horizontal).   The  principle of superposition  states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a form of vertical time line, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed.   The  principle of faunal succession  is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found. Based on principles laid out by  William Smith  almost a hundred years before the publication of  Charles Darwin 's  theory of evolution , the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat ( facies  change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time.     [ edit ]   Modern Geology     [ edit ]   Radioactive decay and the Age of the Earth       Main articles:  Radiometric dating  and  Age of the Earth       A large advance in geology in the advent of the 20th century was the ability to use ratios of radioactive  isotopes  to find the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through a particular temperature. These methods work by measuring the time since a particular mineral grain cooled through its  closure temperature , at which point the different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing out of the crystal lattice. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The advent of isotopic dating changed the understanding of geologic time. Before, geologists could only use fossils to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, absolute dating became possible, and these absolute dates could be applied fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.   Geologists  have used radioactive decay to establish the  age of the Earth  at about 4.54 billion (4.5x10 9 ) years [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  and the age of the oldest planetary material ( Carbonaceous Chondrite  meteorites) at 4.567 billion years. [ 15 ]          Oceanic-continental convergence resulting in  subduction  and  volcanic arcs  illustrates one effect of  plate tectonics .         [ edit ]   Plate Tectonics       Main article:  plate tectonics       In the 1960's, a series of discoveries, the most important of which was  seafloor spreading [ 16 ] , showed that the Earth's  lithosphere , which includes the  crust  and rigid uppermost portion of the  upper mantle , is separated into a number of  tectonic plates  that move across the plastically-deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the  asthenosphere . There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the  convection of the mantle : plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting  mantle  is called  plate tectonics .          On this diagram, subducting slabs are in blue, and continental margins and a few plate boundaries are in red. The blue blob in the cutaway section is the seismically-imaged  Farallon Plate , which is subducting beneath North America. The remnants of this plate on the Surface of the Earth are the  Juan de Fuca Plate  and  Explorer plate  in the Northwestern USA / Southwestern Canada, and the  Cocos Plate  on the west coast of Mexico.       The development of plate tectonics provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth. Long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries.  Mid-ocean ridges , high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist, were explained as  divergent boundaries , where two plates move apart. Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as  convergent boundaries , where one plate  subducts  under another.  Transform boundaries , such as the  San Andreas fault  system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for  Alfred Wegener's  theory of  continental drift [ 17 ] , in which the  continents  move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of  structural geology . The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.     [ edit ]   Earth Structure       Main article:  Structure of the Earth              Earth layered structure. (1) inner core; (2) outer core; (3) lower mantle; (4) upper mantle; (5) lithosphere; (6) crust              Earth layered structure. Typical wave paths from earthquakes like these gave early seismologists insights into the layered structure of the Earth       Advances in  seismology ,  computer modeling , and  mineralogy  and  crystallography  at high temperatures and pressures give insights into the internal composition and structure of the Earth.   Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid  outer core  (where  shear waves  were not able to propagate) and a dense solid  inner core . These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a  crust  and  lithosphere  on top, the  mantle  below (separated within itself by  seismic discontinuities  at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.   Mineralogists have been able to use the pressure and temperature data from the seismic and modelling studies alongside knowledge of the elemental composition of the Earth at depth to reproduce these conditions in experimental settings and measure changes in crystal structure. These studies explain the chemical changes associated with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle, and show the crystallographic structures expected in the inner core of the Earth.     [ edit ]   Planetary Geology          Surface of Mars as photographed by the  Viking 2  lander  December 9 ,  1977 .           Main articles:  Planetary geology  and  Geology of solar terrestrial planets       With the advent of  space exploration  in the twentieth century, geologists have begun to look at other planetary bodies in the same way as the Earth. This led to the establishment of the field of  planetary geology , sometimes known as Astrogeology, in which geologic principles are applied to other bodies of the solar system.   Although the Greek-language-origin prefix  geo  refers to Earth, ""geology"" is often used in conjunction with the names of other planetary bodies when describing their composition and internal processes: examples are ""the  geology of Mars "" and "" Lunar geology "". Specialised terms such as  selenology  (studies of the moon),  areology  (of Mars), etc., are also in use.   Although planetary geologists are interested in all aspects of the planets, a significant focus is in the search for past or present life on other worlds. This has led to many missions whose purpose (or one of their purposes) is to examine planetary bodies for evidence of life. One of this is the  Phoenix lander , which analyzed  Martian  polar soil for water and chemical and mineralogical constituents related to biological processes.

Millions of Years     The  Holocene  (the latest  epoch ) is too small to be shown clearly on this timeline.     [ edit ]   Geological evolution of an area          An originally horizontal sequence of sedimentary rocks (in shades of tan) are affected by  igneous  activity. Deep below the surface are a  magma chamber  and large associated igneous bodies. The magma chamber feeds the  volcano , and sends off shoots of  magma  that will later crystallize into dikes and sills. Magma also advances upwards to form  intrusive igneous bodies . The diagram illustrates both a  cinder cone  volcano, which releases ash, and a  composite volcano , which releases both lava and ash.       The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.   Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the overlying rocks. Deposition can occur when  sediments  settle onto the surface of the Earth and later  lithify  into  sedimentary rock , or when as  volcanic material  such as  volcanic ash  or  lava flows , blanket the surface.  Igneous intrusions  such as  batholiths ,  laccoliths ,  dikes , and  sills , push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.          An illustration of the three types of faults. Strike-slip faults occur when rock units slide past one another, normal faults occur when rocks are undergoing horizontal extension, and thrust faults occur when rocks are undergoing horizontal shortening.       After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be  deformed  and/or  metamorphosed . Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening,  horizontal extension , or side-to-side ( strike-slip ) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to  convergent boundaries ,  divergent boundaries , and  transform boundaries , respectively, between tectonic plates.          A diagram of folds, indicating an anticline and a syncline.       When rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through  faulting  and  folding . In the shallow crust, where  brittle deformation  can occur,  thrust faults  form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often younger, as noted by the  principle of superposition , this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in  folding , either because the faults are not planar, or because the rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds, as slip occurs are along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave  plasticly , and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating "" antiforms "", or where it buckles downwards, creating "" synforms "". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called  anticlines  and  synclines , respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.   Even higher pressures and temperatures during horizontal shortening can cause both folding and  metamorphism  of the rocks. This metamorphism causes changes in the  mineral composition  of the rocks; creates a  foliation , or planar surface, that is related to mineral growth under stress; and can remove signs of the original textures of the rocks, such as  bedding  in sedimentary rocks, flow features of  lavas , and crystal patterns in  crystalline rocks .   Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through  normal faulting  and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units being placed below older units. Stretching of units can result in their thinning; in fact, there is a location within the  Maria Fold and Thrust Belt  in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter. Rocks at the depth to be ductily stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses, known as  boudins , after the French word for ""sausage"", because of their visual similarity.   Where rock units slide past one another,  strike-slip faults  develop in shallow regions, and become  shear zones  at deeper depths where the rocks deform ductily.          Geologic cross-section of  Kittatinny Mountain . This cross-section shows metamorphic rocks, overlain by younger sediments deposited after the metamorphic event. These rock units were later folded and faulted during the uplift of the mountain.       The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create  accommodation space  for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below.  Dikes , long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of  dike swarms , such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.   All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment, and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The  Hawaiian Islands , for example, consist almost entirely of layered  basaltic  lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and and the  Grand Canyon  in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since  Cambrian  time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the  Acasta gneiss  of the  Slave craton  in northwestern  Canada , the  oldest known rock in the world  have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.     [ edit ]   Methods of geology   Geologists use a number of field, laboratory, and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and understand the processes that occur on and in the Earth. In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to  petrology  (the study of rocks),  stratigraphy  (the study of sedimentary layers), and  structural geology  (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation). In many cases, geologists also study modern  soils ,  rivers ,  landscapes , and  glaciers ; investigate past and current life and  biogeochemical  pathways, and use  geophysical methods  to investigate the subsurface.     [ edit ]   Field methods          A typical  USGS  field mapping camp in the 1950's.              Today,  handheld computers  with  GPS  and  geographic information systems  software are often used in geological field work.       Geological field work varies depending on the task at hand. Typical fieldwork could consist of:     Geological mapping     Structural mapping: the locations of the major rock units and the faults and folds that led to their placement there.   Stratigraphic mapping: the locations of  sedimentary facies  ( lithofacies  and  biofacies ) or the mapping of  isopachs  of equal thickness of sedimentary rock   Surficial mapping: the locations of soils and surficial deposits       Surveying of topographic features    Creation of  topographic maps   Work to understand change across landscapes, including:    Patterns of  erosion  and  deposition   River channel change through  migration  and  avulsion   Hillslope processes           Subsurface mapping through  geophysical methods .    These methods include:    Shallow  seismic  surveys   Ground-penetrating radar   Electrical resistivity tomography       They are used for:    Hydrocarbon exploration   Finding  groundwater   Locating buried archaeological artifacts           High-resolution stratigraphy    Measuring and describing stratigraphic sections on the surface   Well drilling and  logging       Biogeochemistry  and  geomicrobiology     Collecting samples to:    Determine  biochemical pathways   Identify new  species  of organisms.

[ edit ]   Petrology       Main article:  petrology       In addition to the field identification of rocks, petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through  optical microscopy  and by using an  electron microprobe . In an  optical mineralogy  analysis,  thin sections  of rock samples are analyzed through a  petrographic microscope , where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their  birefringence ,  pleochroism ,  twinning , and interference properties with a  conoscopic lens . [ 19 ]  In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals. [ 20 ]   Stable [ 21 ]  and  radioactive isotope [ 22 ]  studies provide insight into the  geochemical  evolution of rock units.   Petrologists use  fluid inclusion  data [ 23 ]  and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments [ 24 ]  to understand the temperatures and pressures at which different mineral phases appear, and how they change through igneous [ 25 ]  and metamorphic processes. This research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks. [ 26 ]  This work can also help to explain processes that occur within the Earth, such as  subduction  and  magma chamber  evolution.     [ edit ]   Structural geology          A diagram of an orogenic wedge. The wedge grows through faulting in the interior and along the main basal fault, called the  dcollement . It builds its shape into a  critical taper , in which the angles within the wedge remain the same as failures inside the material balance failures along the dcollement. It is analagous to a bulldozer pushing a pile of dirt, where the bulldozer is the overriding plate.           Main article:  structural geology       Structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented  thin sections  of geologic samples to observe the  fabric  within the rocks which gives information about strain within the crystal structure of the rocks. They also plot and combine measurements of geological structures in order to better-understand the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area. In addition, they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings.   The analysis of structures is often accomplished by plotting the orientations various features onto  stereonets . A stereonet is a stereographic projection of a sphere onto a plane, in which planes are projected as lines and lines are projected as points. These can be used to find the locations of  fold axes , relationships between several faults, and relationships between other geologic structures.   Among the most well-known experiments in structural geology are those involving  orogenic wedges , which are zones in which  mountains  are built along  convergent  tectonic plate boundaries. [ 27 ]  In the analog versions of these experiments, horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop, which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of an  critically-tapered  (all angles remain the same) orogenic wedge. [ 28 ]  Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt. [ 29 ]  This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of the mountain range. These studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism through pressure, temperature, space, and time. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Stratigraphy          Exploration geologists examining a freshly-recovered drill core. Chile, 1994.           Main article:  stratigraphy       In the laboratory, stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field, such as those from  drill cores . [ 31 ]  Stratigraphers also analayze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface. [ 32 ]  Geophysical data and  well logs  can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface, and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions. [ 33 ]  Stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occuring on the surface of the Earth, [ 34 ]  interpret past environments, and locate areas for water and hydrocarbon extraction.   In the laboratory,  biostratigraphers  analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill cores for the fossils found in them. [ 35 ]  These fossils help scientists to date the core and to understand the  depositional environment  in which the rock units formed. Geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition. [ 36 ]  Magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores. [ 35 ]  Other scientists perform stable isotope studies on the rocks to gain information about past climate. [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   Applied geology     [ edit ]   Economic geology       Main article:  Economic geology       Economic geologists help locate and manage the Earth's  natural resources , such as petroleum and coal, as well as mineral resources, which include metals such as iron, copper, and uranium.     [ edit ]   Mining geology       Main article:  Mining       Mining geology consists of the extractions of mineral resources from the Earth. Some resources of economic interests include  gemstones ,  metals , and many minerals such as  asbestos ,  perlite ,  mica ,  phosphates ,  zeolites ,  clay ,  pumice ,  quartz , and  silica , as well as elements such as  sulfur ,  chlorine , and  helium .     [ edit ]   Petroleum geology       Main article:  Petroleum geology       Petroleum geologists study locations of the subsurface of the Earth which can contain extractable hydrocarbons, especially  petroleum  and  natural gas . Because many of these reservoirs are found in  sedimentary basins [ 37 ] , they study the formation of these basins, as well as their sedimentary and tectonic evolution and the present-day positions of the rock units.     [ edit ]   Soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering       Main articles:  soil mechanics  and  geotechnical engineering       In the field of  civil engineering , geological principles and analyses are used in order to ascertain the mechanical principles of the material on which structures are built. This allows tunnels to be built without collapsing, bridges and skyscrapers to be built with sturdy foundations, and buildings to be built that will not settle in clay and mud. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Hydrology and environmental issues   Geology and geologic principles can be applied to various environmental problems, such as  stream restoration , the restoration of  brownfields , and the understanding of the interactions between natural habitat and the geologic environment. Groundwater hydrology, or  hydrogeology , is used to locate groundwater, [ 39 ]  which can often provide a ready supply of uncontaminated water and is especially important in arid regions, [ 40 ]  and to monitor the spread of contaminants in groundwater wells. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]   Geologists also obtain data through  stratigraphy ,  boreholes ,  core samples , and  ice cores . Ice cores [ 43 ]  and sediment cores [ 44 ]  are used to for paleoclimate reconstructions, which tell geologists about past and present temperature, precipitation, and sea level across the globe. These data are our primary source of information on  global climate change  outside of instrumental data.

Due to the growing demand for clean sources of energy, the manufacture of  solar cells  and  photovoltaic arrays  has expanded dramatically in recent years. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Photovoltaic production has been doubling every two years, increasing by an average of 48 percent each year since 2002, making it the worlds fastest-growing energy technology. At the end of 2007, according to preliminary data, cumulative global production was 12,400  megawatts . [ 4 ]  Roughly 90% of this generating capacity consists of  grid-tied electrical systems . Such installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing)  [ 5 ]  or built into the roof or walls of a building, known as  Building Integrated Photovoltaic  or BIPV for short. [ 6 ]   Net metering  and financial incentives, such as preferential  feed-in tariffs  for solar-generated electricity, have supported solar PV installations in many countries including  Australia ,  Germany ,  Israel , [ 7 ]   Japan , and the  United States .

Note that this is for a horizontal surface, whereas solar panels are normally propped up at an angle and receive more energy per unit area. The small black dots show the area of solar panels needed to generate all of the worlds energy using 8% eff. PVs.              Map of solar electricity potential in Europe       Photovoltaic are best known as a method for generating  electric power  by using  solar cells  packaged in  photovoltaic modules , often electrically connected in multiples as  solar photovoltaic arrays  to convert energy from the  sun  into  electricity . To explain the photovoltaic solar panel more simply, photons from sunlight knock electrons into a higher state of energy, creating electricity. The term  photovoltaic  denotes the unbiased operating mode of a  photodiode  in which current through the device is entirely due to the transduced light energy. Virtually all photovoltaic devices are some type of photodiode.   Solar cells produce  direct current  electricity from light, which can be used to power equipment or to  recharge a battery . The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other  spacecraft , but today the majority of  photovoltaic modules  are used for grid connected power generation. In this case an  inverter  is required to convert the DC to AC. There is a smaller market for off grid power for remote dwellings, roadside emergency telephones,  remote sensing , and  cathodic protection  of  pipelines .   Cells require protection from the environment and are packaged usually behind a glass sheet. When more power is required than a single cell can deliver, cells are electrically connected together to form  photovoltaic modules , or solar panels. A single module is enough to power an emergency telephone, but for a house or a power plant the modules must be arranged in arrays. Although the selling price of modules is still too high to compete with grid electricity in most places, significant financial incentives in Japan and then Germany triggered a huge growth in demand, followed quickly by production.   Perhaps not unexpectedly, a significant market has emerged in urban or grid-proximate locations for solar-power-charged storage-battery based solutions. These are deployed as  stand-by  systems in energy deficient countries like India and as  supplementary  systems in developed markets. In a vast majority of situations such solutions make neither economic nor environmental sense, any green credentials being largely offset by the lead-acid storage systems typically deployed. [ citation needed ]  For some serious issues see  Lead Acid Battery recycling .   The  EPIA / Greenpeace  Advanced Scenario shows that by the year 2030, PV systems could be generating approximately 2,600  TWh  of electricity around the world. This means that, assuming a serious commitment is made to  energy efficiency , enough solar power would be produced globally in twenty-five years time to satisfy the electricity needs of almost 14% of the worlds population. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Current development   The most important issue with solar panels is  capital cost  (installation and materials). Newer alternatives to standard crystalline silicon modules including casting wafers instead of sawing, [ 9 ]  thin film (CdTe [ 10 ]  CIGS, [ 11 ]  amorphous Si, [ 12 ]  microcrystalline Si),  concentrator modules ,  'Sliver' cells , and continuous printing processes. Due to  economies of scale  solar panels get less costly as people use and buy more  as manufacturers increase production to meet demand, the cost and price is expected to drop in the years to come. By early 2006, the average cost per installed watt for a residential sized system was about USD 7.50 to USD 9.50, including panels, inverters, mounts, and electrical items. [ 13 ]   In 2006 investors began offering free solar panel installation in return for a 25 year contract, or  Power Purchase Agreement , to purchase electricity at a fixed price, normally set at or below current electric rates. [ 14 ] [ 15 ]  It is expected that by 2009 over 90% of commercial photovoltaics installed in the United States will be installed using a power purchase agreement. [ 16 ]  An innovative financing arrangement is being tested in  Berkeley, California , which adds an amount to the property assessment to allow the city to pay for the installed panels up front, which the homeowner pays for over a 20 year period at a rate equal to the annual electric bill savings, thus allowing free installation for the homeowner at no cost to the city. [ 17 ]   The current market leader in solar panel efficiency (measured by energy conversion ratio) is  SunPower , a  San Jose  based company. Sunpower's cells have a conversion ratio of 23.4%, well above the market average of 12-18%. [ 18 ]  However, advances past this efficiency mark are being innovated by engineers at  MIT  and the  California Institute of Technology , and efficiencies of 42% have been achieved at the  University of Delaware . [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Worldwide installed totals     See also:  Deployment of solar power to energy grids         Wikinews  has related news:    PV Taiwan 2007 starts with photovoltaic solutions and applications   PV Taiwan 2007: ITRI Taiwan awards winners of Jinyi Award and shows the solutions on photovoltaic industry         World solar photovoltaic (PV) market installations reached a record high of 2.8 gigawatts peak (GWp) in 2007. [ 20 ]   The three leading countries (Germany, Japan and the USA) represent nearly 89% of the total worldwide PV installed capacity. On Wed  1 August   2007 , word was published of construction of a production facility in China, which is projected to be one of the largest wafer factories in the world, with a peak capacity of around 1,500MW. [ 21 ]   Germany was the fastest growing major PV market in the world during 2006 and 2007. In 2007, over 1.3 GWp of PV was installed. The German PV industry generates over 10,000 jobs in production, distribution and installation. By the end of 2006, nearly 88% of all solar PV installations in the EU were in grid-tied applications in Germany. The balance is off-grid (or stand alone) systems. [ 1 ]  Photovoltaic power capacity is measured as maximum power output under standardized test conditions (STC) in ""Wp"" (Watts peak). [ 22 ]  The actual power output at a particular point in time may be less than or greater than this standardized, or ""rated,"" value, depending on geographical location, time of day, weather conditions, and other factors. [ 23 ]  Solar photovoltaic array  capacity factors  are typically under 25%, which is lower than many other industrial sources of electricity. [ 24 ]  Therefore the 2006 installed base peak output would have provided an average output of 1.2 GW (assuming 20%  5,862 MWp). This represented 0.06 percent of global demand at the time.

[ 52 ]  Built on 9.5 square miles (25 km 2 ) of ranchland, [ 53 ]  the project would utilize thin-film PV panels designed and manufactured by OptiSolar in  Hayward  and  Sacramento . The project would deliver approximately 1,100 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually of  renewable energy . The project is expected to begin construction in 2010, [ 53 ]  begin power delivery in 2011, and be fully operational by 2013.

[ 54 ]     [ edit ]   In buildings       Main article:  Building-integrated photovoltaics              Photovoltaic solar panels on a house roof.       Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are increasingly incorporated into new domestic and industrial buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power, [ 55 ]  and are one of the fastest growing segments of the photovoltaic industry. [ 56 ]  Typically, an array is incorporated into the roof or walls of a building, and roof tiles with integrated PV cells can now be purchased. Arrays can also be  retrofitted  into existing buildings; in this case they are usually fitted on top of the existing roof structure. Alternatively, an array can be located separately from the building but connected by cable to supply power for the building.   Where a building is at a considerable distance from the public electricity supply (or  grid ) - in remote or mountainous areas  PV may be the preferred possibility for generating electricity, or PV may be used together with wind, diesel generators and/or hydroelectric power. In such  off-grid  circumstances batteries are usually used to store the electric power.   In locations near the grid, however, feeding the grid using PV panels is more practical, and leads to optimum use of the investment in the photovoltaic system. This requires both regulatory and commercial preparation, including net-metering and feed-in agreements. To provide for possible power failure, some grid tied systems are set up to allow local use disconnected from the grid. Most photovoltaics are grid connected. In the event the grid fails, the local system must not feed the grid to prevent the possible creation of dangerous  islanding .   The power output of photovoltaic systems for installation in buildings is usually described in  kilowatt-peak  units (kWp).     [ edit ]   In transport       Main article:  Photovoltaics in transport       PV has traditionally been used for auxiliary power in space. PV is rarely used to provide motive power in transport applications, but is being used increasingly to provide auxiliary power in boats and cars. Recent advances in solar race cars, however, have produced cars that with little changes could be used for transportation. [ 57 ]     [ edit ]   Standalone devices          Solar parking meter.       Until a decade or so ago, PV was used frequently to power calculators and novelty devices. Improvements in integrated circuits and low power LCD displays make it possible to power such devices for several years between battery changes, making PV use less common. In contrast, solar powered remote fixed devices have seen increasing use recently in locations where significant connection cost makes grid power prohibitively expensive. Such applications include parking meters, [ 58 ]  emergency telephones, [ 59 ]  temporary traffic signs, and remote guard posts & signals.     [ edit ]   Rural electrification   Developing countries where many villages are often more than five kilometers away from grid power have begun using photovoltaics. In remote locations in India a rural lighting program has been providing solar powered LED lighting to replace kerosene lamps. The solar powered lamps were sold at about the cost of a few month's supply of kerosene. [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  Cuba is working to provide solar power for areas that are off grid. [ 62 ]  These are areas where the social costs and benefits offer an excellent case for going solar though the lack of profitability could relegate such endeavors to humanitarian goals.     [ edit ]   Solar roadways   A 45 mi (72 km) section of roadway in Idaho is being used to test the possibility of installing solar panels into the road surface, as roads are generally unobstructed to the sun and represent about the percentage of land area needed to replace other energy sources with solar power.

In photovoltaics, solar value added chain is characterized by the steps from sand/raw silicon to the completed solar module and photovoltaic system promotion and installation  [ 64 ] . [ jargon ]     [ edit ]   Power costs   The PV industry is beginning to adopt levelized cost of energy (LCOE) as the unit of cost. The results of a sample calculation can be found on pp. 52, 53 of the 2007  DOE  report describing the plans for solar power 2007-2011  [1] . For a 10 MW plant in Phoenix, AZ, the LCOE is estimated at $0.15 to 0.22/kWh.   The table below is a pure mathematical calculation. It illustrates the calculated total cost in US cents per  kilowatt-hour  of electricity generated by a photovoltaic system as function of the investment cost and the efficiency, assuming some accounting parameters such as cost of capital and depreciation period. The row headings on the left show the total cost, per  peak kilowatt  (kWp), of a photovoltaic installation. The column headings across the top refer to the annual energy output in kilowatt-hours expected from each installed peak kilowatt. This varies by geographic region because the average  insolation  depends on the average cloudiness and the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the sunlight. It also depends on the path of the sun relative to the panel and the horizon.   Panels can be mounted at an angle based on  latitude , which can add to total energy output. [ 65 ]   Solar tracking  can also be utilized to access even more perpendicular sunlight, thereby raising the total energy output. The calculated values in the table reflect the total cost in cents per kilowatt-hour produced. They assume a 10% total capital cost (for instance 4%  interest rate , 1% operating and maintenance cost, and  depreciation  of the capital outlay over 20 years).

In 2007,  David Faiman , the director of the  Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center  of Israel, announced that the the Center had entered into a project with  Zenith Solar  to create a home solar energy system that uses a 10  square meter  reflector dish. [ 66 ]  In testing, the concentrated solar technology proved to be up to five times more cost effective than standard flat photovoltaic  silicon  panels, which would make it almost the same cost as oil and natural gas. [ 67 ]  A prototype ready for commercialization achieved a concentration of solar energy that was more than 1,000 times greater than standard flat panels. [ 68 ]     [ edit ]   Grid parity   Further information:  Low-cost solar cell  and  Solar America Initiative   Grid parity, the point at which photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than  grid power , is achieved first in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in  California  and  Japan . [ 69 ]   Grid parity has been reached in  Hawaii  and other islands that otherwise use  fossil fuel  ( diesel fuel ) to produce electricity.   George W. Bush  set 2015 as the date for grid parity in the USA. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] . Abengoa Solar has announced the award of two R&D projects in the field of  Concentrating Solar Power  (CSP) by the  US Department of Energy  that total over $14 million. The goal of the DOE R&D program, working in collaboration with partners such as Abengoa Solar, is to develop C.S.P. technologies that are competitive with conventional energy sources ( grid parity ) by 2015. [ 72 ]   General Electric 's Chief Engineer predicts grid parity without subsidies in sunny parts of the United States by around 2015. Other companies predict an earlier date [ 73 ] : the cost of solar power will be below grid parity for more than half of residential customers and 10% of commercial customers in the  OECD , as long as grid electricity prices do not decrease through 2010 [ 74 ] .   The fully-loaded cost ( cost  not  price ) of solar electricity is $0.25/kWh or less in most of the  OECD  countries. By late 2011, the fully-loaded cost is likely to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: [ 74 ]     vertical integration of the supply chain;   origination of  power purchase agreements  (PPAs) by solar power companies;   unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies,  grid operators  and  turbine manufacturers .       [ edit ]   Financial incentives       Main article:  PV financial incentives       The political purpose of incentive policies for PV is to facilitate an initial small-scale deployment to begin to grow the industry, even where the cost of PV is significantly above grid parity, to allow the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity. The policies are implemented to promote national energy independence, high tech job creation and reduction of CO 2  emissions.   Three incentive mechanisms are used (often in combination):     investment subsidies: the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system,   Feed-in Tariffs  (FIT)/ Net metering : the electricity utility buys PV electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate.   Renewable Energy Certificates  (""RECs"")     With investment subsidies, the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as  Austin Energy  in  Texas , which offers $4.50/watt installed up to $13,500. [ 75 ]   With feed-in tariffs, the financial burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced over a long period of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged. Net metering is particularly important because it can be done with no changes to standard  electricity meters , which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. As more photovoltaics are used ultimately storage will need to be provided, normally in the form of  pumped hydro-storage . Normally with net metering deficits are billed each month, while surpluses are rolled over to the following month and paid annually.   Where price setting by supply and demand is preferred, RECs can be used. In this mechanism, a renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the consumer or producer is obliged to purchase renewable energy from whoever provides it the most competitively. The producer is paid via an REC. In principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy, since the lowest bidder will win. However, uncertainties about the future value of energy produced are a brake on investment in capacity, and the higher risk increases the cost of capital borrowed.   The Japanese government through its Ministry of International Trade and Industry ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003. By the end of 2004, Japan led the world in installed PV capacity with over 1.1 GW. [ 76 ]   In 2004, the German government introduced the first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under a law known as the 'EEG' (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz) which resulted in explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20 year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.   Subsequently Spain, Italy, Greece and France introduced feed-in tariffs. None have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though, making the German incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries. The French FIT offers a uniquely high premium (EUR 0.55/kWh) for building integrated systems. California, Greece, France and Italy have 30-50% more insolation than Germany making them financially more attractive.   In 2006 California approved the ' California Solar Initiative ', offering a choice of investment subsidies or FIT for small and medium systems and a FIT for large systems. The small-system FIT of $0.39 per kWh (far less than EU countries) expires in just 5 years, and the alternate ""EPBB"" residential investment incentive is modest, averaging perhaps 20% of cost. All California incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of PV capacity installed.   At the end of 2006, the Ontario Power Authority (Canada) began its  Standard Offer Program , the first in North America for small renewable projects (10MW or less). This guarantees a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh over a period of twenty years. Unlike  net metering , all the electricity produced is sold to the OPA at the SOP rate. The generator then purchases any needed electricity at the current prevailing rate (e.g., $0.055 per kWh). The difference should cover all the costs of installation and operation over the life of the contract.   The price per kilowatt hour or per peak kilowatt of the FIT or investment subsidies is only one of three factors that stimulate the installation of PV. The other two factors are insolation (the more sunshine, the less capital is needed for a given power output) and administrative ease of obtaining permits and contracts.   Unfortunately the complexity of approvals in California, Spain and Italy has prevented comparable growth to Germany even though the return on investment is better.   In some countries, additional incentives are offered for BIPV compared to stand alone PV.     France + EUR 0.25/kWh (EUR 0.30 + 0.25 = 0.55/kWh total)   Italy + EUR 0.04-0.09 kWh   Germany + EUR 0.05/kWh (facades only)       [ edit ]   Environmental impacts   Unlike  fossil fuel  based technologies, solar power does not lead to any harmful emissions during operation, but the production of the panels leads to some amount of pollution. This is often referred to as the energy input to output ratio. In some analysis, if the energy input to produce it is higher than the output it produces it can be considered environmentally more harmful than beneficial. Also, placement of photovoltaics affects the environment. If they are located where photosynthesizing plants would normally grow, they simply substitute one potentially renewable resource ( biomass ) for another. It should be noted, however, that the biomass cycle converts  solar radiation energy to chemical energy  ( with significantly less efficiency than photovoltaic cells alone). And if they are placed on the sides of buildings (such as in  Manchester ) or fences, or rooftops (as long as plants would not normally be placed there), or in the desert they are purely additive to the renewable power base. [ citations needed ]     [ edit ]   Greenhouse gases   Life cycle   greenhouse gas  emissions are now in the range of 25-32 g/ kWh  and this could decrease to 15 g/kWh in the future. [ 77 ]  For comparison, a  combined cycle  gas-fired power plant emits some 400 g/kWh and a coal-fired power plant 915 g/kWh and with  carbon capture and storage  some 200 g/kWh. Only nuclear power and wind are better, emitting 6-25 g/kWh and 11 g/kWh on average. Using renewable energy sources in manufacturing and transportation would further drop photovoltaic emissions.     [ edit ]   Cadmium   One issue that has often raised concerns is the use of  cadmium  in  cadmium telluride solar cells  (CdTe is only used in a few types of PV panels). Cadmium in its metallic form is a toxic substance that has the tendency to  accumulate  in ecological  food chains . The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5-10 g/m) and with proper emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3-0.9  microgram /kWh over the whole life-cycle. [ 77 ]  Most of these emissions actually arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and  lignite  combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and  natural gas  0.2 microgram/kWh.   Note that if electricity produced by photovoltaic panels were used to manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal, cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated.     [ edit ]   Energy payback time and energy returned on energy invested   The  energy payback time  is the time required to produce an amount of energy as great as what was consumed during production. The energy payback time is determined from a  life cycle analysis  of energy.   Another key indicator of environmental performance, tightly related to the energy payback time, is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build  and maintain  the equipment. This ratio is called the  energy returned on energy invested  (EROEI). Of course, little is gained if it takes as much energy to produce the modules as they produce in their lifetimes. This should not be confused with the economic return on investment, which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.   Life-cycle analyses show that the energy intensity of typical solar photovoltaic technologies is rapidly evolving. In 2000 the energy payback time was estimated as 8 to 11 years [ 78 ] , but more recent studies suggest that technological progress has reduced this to 1.5 to 3.5 years for crystalline silicon PV systems  [ 77 ] .   Thin film technologies now have energy pay-back times in the range of 1-1.5 years (S.Europe). [ 77 ]  With lifetimes of such systems of at least 30 years, the EROEI is in the range of 10 to 30. They thus generate enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions, the EROEI is a bit lower) depending on what type of material,  balance of system  (or BOS), and the geographic location of the system. [ 79 ]     [ edit ]   Advantages             This section  is in a list format that may be better presented using  prose .  You can help by converting this section to prose, if  appropriate .  Editing help  is available.  (January 2009)         The 89  petawatts  of sunlight reaching the earth's surface is plentiful - almost 6,000 times more than the 15  terawatts  of average power consumed by humans. [ 80 ]  Additionally, solar electric generation has the highest power density (global mean of 170 W/m) among renewable energies. [ 80 ]   Solar power is pollution free during use. Production end wastes and emissions are manageable using existing pollution controls. End-of-use recycling technologies are under development. [ 81 ]   Facilities can operate with little maintenance or intervention after initial setup.   Solar electric generation is economically superior where grid connection or fuel transport is difficult, costly or impossible. Examples include satellites, island communities, remote locations and ocean vessels.   When grid-connected, solar electric generation can displace the highest cost electricity during times of peak demand (in most climatic regions), can reduce grid loading, and can eliminate the need for local battery power for use in times of darkness and high local demand; such application is encouraged by  net metering . Time-of-use net metering can be highly favorable to small photovoltaic systems.   Grid-connected solar electricity can be used locally thus reducing transmission/distribution losses (transmission losses were approximately 7.2% in 1995). [ 82 ]   Once the initial  capital cost  of building a solar power plant has been spent,  operating costs  are extremely low compared to existing power technologies.   Compared to fossil and nuclear energy sources, very little research-money has been invested in the development of solar cells, so there is much room for improvement. Nevertheless, experimental  high efficiency solar cells  already have efficiencies of over 40% and efficiencies are rapidly rising while mass production costs are rapidly falling. [ 83 ]       [ edit ]   Disadvantages             This section  is in a list format that may be better presented using  prose .  You can help by converting this section to prose, if  appropriate .  Editing help  is available.  (January 2009)         Depending on the cost of the installation and local electric rates the payback can be 14-20 years. Since the modules are warranted for 20 years and their lifespan is anywhere from 15 to 40 years it only makes sense if you intend on living there more then 20 years.   Solar electricity is more expensive based on current rates. Once a PV system is installed it will produce electricity for the same cost until the inverter needs replacing (about 12 years). Current utility rates have increased every year for the past 20 years and with the increasing pressure on carbon reduction the rate will increase more aggressively. This increase will (in the long run) easily offset the increased cost at installation but the timetable for payback is too long for most.   Solar electricity is not available at night and is less available in cloudy weather conditions from conventional silicon based technologies. Therefore, a  storage or complementary power system  is required. However, the use of germanium in amorphous silicon-germanium thin film solar cells provides residual power generating capacity at night due to background infrared radiation.   Limited power density: Average daily insolation in the contiguous U.S. is 3-7 Gigawatth/km [ clarification needed ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ]  and on average lower in Europe.   Solar cells produce  DC  which must be converted to  AC  (using a  grid tie inverter ) when used in currently existing distribution grids. This incurs an energy loss of 4-12%.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common source of  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon  burning in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. They are used for structural purposes, as their alloy content raises their cost and necessitates justification of their use. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron -- which binds non-specifically to many cellular components -- can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables (haem iron), [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

This policy has been instrumental in California’s efforts to increase energy efficiency.  Under decoupling, Californias per-capita energy use has remained relatively flat over the last thirty years.  In perspective, energy use per capita in the rest of the country has surged by 50%. California’s lead has been followed by many states nationwide and may become one of the best policy tools for increasing energy efficiency.   This map shows the different policies by state.                 (Image: NRDC)           Read the  CPUC factsheet on decoupling                 Posted by Andrew Galbraith at 1:00pm on 01/07/09.

Peter Kelemen, a geologist for Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory is lead author of the study.  According to Kelemen, in Oman alone, efficient use of the rock could sequester four billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, and major formations of peridotite also exist in the French territory New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and the Balkans.   Kelemen and co-author Jrg Matter suggested that using existing drilling technology, engineers could create a free pump by drilling two holes into peridotite located just offshore, pumping hot water and carbon dioxide into one hole, generating heat and causing more of the rock to fracture.  Subsequently, the rock would extract carbon dioxide that has been absorbed by the ocean and gradually, the water would rise through the other hole, where it could cool and take in more carbon dioxide from the sea. Then the “free pump” would kick in, thrusting subterranean hot water to the surface and channeling cool, carbon dioxide-rich water back to the rocks through the process of convection. Almost no energy would be required to keep the cycle going, the researchers said.  However, peridotite formations can’t take in carbon dioxide indefinitely, as eventually every atom in the formation will have reacted with the pumped-in carbon dioxide, and the rock will be exhausted.   Kelemen and Matter have filed patent papers for these techniques.

Email story     Story link  | Filed under:  Climate Change                     Growing Interest in Great Lakes Wind Farms                       (Photo:Flickr)           The Great Lakes of Canada and the U.S. boast growing interest in developing offshore wind farms on their waters.  Smaller waves and the absence of corrosive saltwater make the Great Lakes an attractive alternative to ocean developments along the East Coast.  Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario are the largest string of freshwater bodies in the world, and the area could support its own offshore industry of manufacturing plants for turbines, installation boats and thousands of windmill parts where traditional industries are dying.   Michigan State University recently released  a report  concluding that Michigan’s offshore potential is 20 times that of its onshore wind capacity. The University says winds over lakes Michigan, Superior and Huron could spin up to 99,000 turbines and generate as much as 322,000 MW.   Likewise, Cleveland has conducted a  feasibility study  related to a proposed farm with two to 20 turbines on Lake Erie. The emphasis there is on manufacturing jobs created by erecting such a farm. Ohio wants to supply forests of turbines throughout the lakes with parts and service.   In Toronto,  Trillium Power Energy Corp.  is planning a wind farm for Lake Ontario, with about 140 turbines able to generate 700 megawatts (MW) of electricity  enough to power 200,000 homes.  A shortage of barges is a barrier to entry, so Trillium plans to build its own installation barge.  John Kourtoff, Trillium’s president and CEO, said construction could begin in two years.

New York City is currently one of the country’s most light-polluted cities, according to the  International Dark-Sky Association , but that may be changing soon.  The New York State Assembly passed legislation in June requiring that new outdoor lighting have shields that reduce glare and waste. City Councilman Alan J. Gerson has introduced a variety of similar measures, and the first of the proposals could be taken up as early as this month.   The commercial and  residential sectors have been taking action as well, with companies like  Incisive Media  and  The Associated Press  using strategies such as dividing floors into zones for overhead lighting so that not all of the space has to be lit or dark at a given time. Similarly, landlords have found that implementing more energy efficient technologies in their buildings is a selling point with tenants, especially those that pay their own electricity bills, and many tenants are installing more efficient lights themselves. Additionally, the cost of efficient lighting technology - motion sensors, timers, LEDs, halogens, and compact fluorescent bulbs - is falling, and in some cases, it now only takes two years to recoup the investment. Of particular help are  rebates from state agencies and utilities  aiming to reduce consumption in order to relieve stress on the electric grid and avoid  construction of expensive power plants.   Other cities have been looking at the issue of waste in lighting as well.  San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin recently  proposed a law  that would force businesses in the city’s downtown skyscrapers to turn off unnecessary lights at night.

Email story     Story link  | Filed under:  Institutional                     New Solar Panel Coating Absorbs More Sunlight                       Typical solar panels reflect sunlight and do not absorb all colors (Photo: Flickr)           Researchers at  Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute  recently developed an innovative new coating for solar cells that absorbs more than 96 percent of available sunlight, compared to uncoated panels which typically absorb around 67 percent. The material works by absorbing light from every angle, capturing sunlight regardless of the sun’s position in the sky. This not only improves efficiency but also obviates the need for expensive mechanization used to rotate panels. Additionally, current technology requires solar panels to be installed only on south facing roofs or areas which receive copious direct sunlight, whereas the new coating could change all this.   A nanoengineered technology, the coating is made up of seven extremely thin layers of porous material stacked in a way that enhances the anti-reflective properties of the layer below, trapping light from all angles. The coating also absorbs light across a broader color spectrum than regular panels. Physics professor Shawn-Yu Lin explains, “If you look at a solar panel, it looks a bit bluish, telling you not all of the blue color is being absorbed. It should look totally dark.”   By increasing the efficiency of existing solar panels, the coating offers a potential way to save money and boost electricity generation without investing in an all-new system. Once developed, the new coating could be applied to almost any photovoltaic material and researchers anticipate that the product could be on the market within the next 2 to 3 years.

The program has about 4,000 customers and will fund farm-producers who supply renewable energy, other renewable products, or incentives to help more farms get into the energy business. The Cow Power process works to capture methane, which is  72 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period , and turn it into energy. Manure and other agricultural waste are held in a sealed concrete tank at the same temperature as a cow’s stomach, (101 degrees), while bacteria digest the volatile components, creating methane and killing pathogens and weed seeds. The methane then fuels a generator, putting this powerful greenhouse gas to good use.   The funds will be paid through a four cent per kilowatt hour premium, and customers can choose to receive all, half, or a quarter of their electricity through Cow Power. The Forest Service has elected to receive 25% of their electricity through cow power, costing them $2,100 more for electricity per year, a bold statement which the Forest Service hopes will encourage renewable energy development.  The money goes to participating farm-producers to purchase renewable energy credits when enough farm energy isn’t available, or to the CVPS Renewable Development Fund. Farm-producers are also paid 95% of the market price for all of the energy sold to CVPS.   For more information, visit  www.cvps.com/cowpower .

The report, called “Energy Efficiency, Innovation and Job Creation in California,” said that if California improves energy efficiency by one percent per year and meets proposed cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, it will create 403,000 jobs by 2020 and increase the state’s gross product by $76 billion. California aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.   According to Roland-Holst, when people save money on utility bills and gasoline, it frees up money for buying other things.  Money spent locally on hairdressers or at restaurants goes further to spur the economy than spending money on energy, which is less labor-intensive and often sends money out of state and out of the country, said Roland-Holst.   Roland-Holst based his findings on household spending on electricity since the 1970s. California’s efficiency policies have cut per capita electricity use in the state 40% below the U.S. national average, the report said.

Email story     Story link  | Filed under:                     Google Plans Water-Based Data Centers           Google recently filed a  patent  for a “water-based data center” that uses the ocean to provide power and cooling. The patent confirms Google’s development of a container-based data center, and Google says the data center containers could be stacked two or more high, so that each data barge could hold “12 or more” containers.  The patent documents describe a cooling system based on sea-powered pumps and seawater-to-freshwater heat exchangers.               A sketch from Google’s patent application for a floating data center.  (Photo: Google)           The floating data centers would be located 3 to 7 miles from shore, in 50 to 70 meters of water. If successful, this approach could be used to build 40 megawatt data centers that dont require real estate, aren’t subject to property taxes and may not be subject to the same laws as data centers on land. Google said it would use signaling mechanisms such as strobing lights, flags, and horns to alert ships of the location of its data centers. In contrast, Googles competitor,  IDS (International Data Security) , plans to build up to 50 data centers on de-commissioned cargo ships moored at piers in major cities.   The Google design incorporates the  Pelamis Wave Energy Converter  units, which use the motion of ocean surface waves to create electricity and can be combined to form “wave farms.” Diagrams included with Google’s patent application indicate the company plans to combine 40 or more Pelamis units to produce 40 megawatts of power.   Google previously was granted a patent for a portable data center inside a shipping container, which the company began developing in 2003, well before competitors began unveiling products based on the “data center in a box” concept.   Google has also announced earlier this year that it would partner with five other companies in building an undersea communications cable across the Pacific to provide high-speed connectivity to new Google data centers in Asia.

We’ve gone back because they make great, affordable wines, but, to be honest, even if that weren’t the case, I’d return to show off  Cline’s sustainability measures  to visiting family and friends.   Cline is at the vanguard of an ever-growing contingent of California wineries that have installed solar. In fact, as we’ve written about in  e-Newswire , California’s wineries are  adding solar power at a rate estimated to be more than 40 times faster  than California businesses in general. They’ve done so to hedge against rising electricity bills and to reduce their carbon footprints, yes, but many of them also realize that, if they don’t act, climate change threatens their very existence.   At Cline, they’ve covered the roof of their 50,000-sq.-ft warehouse with a 411-kilowatt solar electric system. Installed in 2005 by  SolarCraft , the system eliminates Cline’s annual electricity bill. The winery expects to be cash positive on their solar investment in just a few years (they estimate a 5- to 6-year payback).               Cline Cellars’ 411-kW rooftop PV installation supplies 100% of the winery’s annual electricity use (Photo: Justin Gerdes)           Prudently, Cline was careful to reduce its electricity demand before installing solar panels. SolarCraft assessed Cline’s consumption and then advised the winery to install energy-efficient lighting throughout its warehouse and fermentation buildings.   In between the rooftop solar panels and the barrels of zinfandel and syrah aging below in the warehouse sits an insulated urethane foam roof that reduces summer cooling costs by up to 30%. The foam roof works remarkably well. Stepping into the warehouse on a 98-degree July day, my wife and I were wrapped in a blanket of cool air. Responding to a question from our tour group, the guide assured us that the AC wasn’t on.   Here’s a short video produced by  RenewableEnergyWorld.com  in which Todd Miklos with  Advanced Energy , a partner with SolarCraft on the solar project, talk’s about Cline’s decision to go solar:                Posted by Justin Gerdes at 4:32pm on 09/19/08.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidizes readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes   Main article:  Allotropes of iron   Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallizes at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy          The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore   See also:  Iron ore          Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace   Main article:  Blast furnace          Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes   Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks   Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content, the higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes   Main article:  Isotopes of iron   Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b       Main article:  Human iron metabolism   Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption, high blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

(November 2008)       A  solar cell  or  photovoltaic cell  is a device that converts  solar energy  into  electricity  by the  photovoltaic effect . [ 1 ]  Sometimes the term  solar cell  is reserved for devices intended specifically to capture energy from sunlight, while the term  photovoltaic cell  is used when the source is unspecified. Assemblies of cells are used to make  solar panel ,  solar modules , or  photovoltaic arrays .  Photovoltaics  is the field of technology and research related to the application of solar cells for  solar energy .

The term ""photo-voltaic"" has been in use in English since 1849. [ 2 ]   The photovoltaic effect was first recognized in 1839 by French physicist  A. E. Becquerel . However, it was not until 1883 that the first solar cell was built, by  Charles Fritts , who coated the  semiconductor   selenium  with an extremely thin layer of  gold  to form the junctions. The device was only around 1% efficient. Sven Ason Berglund had a number of patents concerning methods of increasing the capacity of these cells.  Russell Ohl  patented the modern junction semiconductor solar cell in 1946 ( U.S. Patent 2,402,662   , "" Light sensitive device ""), which was discovered while working on the series of advances that would lead to the  transistor .   The modern age of solar power technology arrived in 1954 when  Bell Laboratories , experimenting with semiconductors, accidentally found that  silicon  doped with certain impurities was very sensitive to light. This resulted in the production of the first practical solar cells with a sunlight energy conversion efficiency of around 6 percent. The first spacecraft to use solar panels was the US satellite  Vanguard 1 , launched in March 1958 with solar cells made by  Hoffman Electronics . This milestone created interest in producing and launching a  geostationary  communications  satellite , in which solar energy would provide a viable power supply. This was a crucial development which stimulated funding from several governments into research for improved solar cells.   In 1970 the first highly effective  GaAs   heterostructure  solar cells were created by  Zhores Alferov  and his team in the  USSR . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD, or OMCVD) production equipment was not developed until the early 1980s, limiting the ability of companies to manufacture the GaAs solar cell. In the United States, the first 17% efficient air mass zero ( AM0 ) single-junction GaAs solar cells were manufactured in production quantities in 1988 by Applied Solar Energy Corporation (ASEC). The ""dual junction"" cell was accidentally produced in quantity by ASEC in 1989 as a result of the change from GaAs on GaAs substrates to GaAs on Germanium (Ge) substrates. The accidental doping of Ge with the GaAs buffer layer created higher open circuit voltages, demonstrating the potential of using the Ge substrate as another cell. As GaAs single-junction cells topped 19%  AM0  production efficiency in 1993, ASEC developed the first dual junction cells for spacecraft use in the United States, with a starting efficiency of approximately 20%. These cells did not utilize the Ge as a second cell, but used another GaAs-based cell with different doping. Eventually GaAs dual junction cells reached production efficiencies of about 22%. Triple Junction solar cells began with  AM0  efficiencies of approximately 24% in 2000, 26% in 2002, 28% in 2005, and in 2007 have evolved to a 30%  AM0  production efficiency, currently in qualification.   Recent world record claims of efficiency for multiple junction solar cells are discussed in the Records section.     [ edit ]   Three generations of solar cells   Solar Cells are classified into three generations which indicates the order of which each became important. At present there is concurrent research into all three generations while the first generation technologies are most highly represented in commercial production, accounting for 89.6% of 2007 production. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   First Generation       Main articles:  Crystalline silicon  and  Vacuum deposition       First generation cells consist of large-area, high quality and  single junction  devices. First Generation technologies involve high energy and labour inputs which prevent any significant progress in reducing production costs. Single junction silicon devices are approaching the theoretical limiting efficiency of 33% [ 7 ]  and achieve cost parity with  fossil fuel  energy generation after a payback period of 5-7 years. [ 8 ]  They are not likely to get lower than US$1/W. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Second Generation       Main article:  Thin-film cell       Second generation materials have been developed to address energy requirements and production costs of solar cells. Alternative manufacturing techniques such as  vapour deposition ,  electroplating , and use of  Ultrasonic Nozzles  are advantageous as they reduce high temperature processing significantly. It is commonly accepted that as manufacturing techniques evolve production costs will be dominated by constituent material requirements, [ 7 ]  whether this be a  silicon   substrate , or  glass cover . Second generation technologies are expected to gain market share in 2008. [ 6 ]   Such processes can bring costs down to a little under US$0.50/W but because of the defects inherent in the lower quality processing methods, have much reduced efficiencies compared to First Generation. [ 9 ]   The most successful second generation materials have been  cadmium telluride  (CdTe),  copper indium gallium selenide ,  amorphous silicon  and  micromorphous silicon . [ 6 ]  These materials are applied in a  thin film  to a supporting substrate such as glass or  ceramics  reducing material mass and therefore costs. These technologies do hold promise of higher  conversion efficiencies , particularly  CIGS-CIS ,  DSC  and  CdTe  offers significantly cheaper production costs.   Among major manufacturers there is certainly a trend toward second generation technologies however commercialisation of these technologies has proven difficult. [ 10 ]  In 2007  First Solar  produced 200 MW of CdTe solar cells making it the fifth largest producer of solar cells in 2007 and the first ever to reach the top 10 from production of second generation technologies alone. [ 10 ]   Wurth Solar  commercialised its  CIS  technology in 2007 producing 15 MW.  Nanosolar  commercialised its CIGS technology in 2007 with a production capacity of 430 MW for 2008 in the USA and Germany. [ 11 ]   Honda Soltec Co., Ltd. , a Honda company, also began to  commercialize  their CIGS base solar panel in 2008.   In 2007 CdTe production represented 4.7% of total market share,  thin-film silicon  5.2% and CIGS 0.5%. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Third Generation       Main article:  Third generation solar cell       Third generation technologies aim to enhance poor electrical performance of second generation (thin-film technologies) while maintaining very low production costs.   Current research is targeting conversion efficiencies of 30-60% while retaining low cost materials and manufacturing techniques. [ 7 ]  They can exceed the theoretical solar conversion efficiency limit for a single energy threshold material, that was calculated in 1961 by  Shockley and Queisser  as 31% under 1  sun  illumination and 40.8% under maximal concentration of sunlight (46,200 suns, which makes the latter limit more difficult to approach than the former). [ 9 ]   There are a few approaches to achieving these high efficiencies: [ 12 ]     Multijunction photovoltaic cell  (multiple energy threshold devices).   Modifying incident spectrum ( concentration ).   Use of excess thermal generation (caused by  UV light ) to enhance voltages or carrier collection.   Use of  infrared  spectrum to produce electricity at night.     Technologies includes:     Silicon nanostructures   Up/Down converters   Hot-carrier cells   Thermoelectric  cells       [ edit ]   High efficiency cells   High efficiency solar cells  are a class of  solar cells  that can generate  electricity  at higher efficiencies than conventional solar cells. While high efficiency solar cells are more efficient in terms of electrical output per incident energy (watt/watt), much of the industry is focused on the most  cost efficient  technologies ( cost-per-watt  or $/watt). Still, many businesses and academics are focused on increasing the electrical efficiency of cells, and much development is focused on high efficiency solar cells.     [ edit ]   Records     [ edit ]   Monocrystalline Si   In 1994, the  University of New South Wales  (UNSW) reported the highest silicon solar cell efficiency of 24.7% with their PERL cell technology. This record has been valid until 2008.   UNSW 's  ARC Photovoltaic Centre of Excellence  has reported the first  silicon solar cell  to achieve the milestone of 25 per cent efficiency. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Polycrystaline Si     [ edit ]   Multiple junction solar cells   The record for multiple junction solar cells is disputed. A team lead by the University of Delaware, the Fraunhofer Institute, and  NREL  all claim the world record title at 42.8, 41.1, and 40.8 percent, respectively.  [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]  NREL claims that the other implementations have never been put under any standardized tests and, in the case of the University of Delaware project, represents only hypothetical efficiencies of a panel that's never been fully assembled. [ 17 ]  However, NREL claims it is one of only three laboratories in the world capable of conducting valid tests. [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Thin film solar cells   In 2002, the highest reported efficiency for solar cells based on thin films of  CdTe  is 18%, which was achieved by the research group of prof.  I.M.Dharmadasa  at  Sheffield Hallam University  in the  United Kingdom .   The US national renewable energy research facility  NREL  achieved an efficiency of 19.9% for the solar cells based on  copper indium gallium selenide  thin films, also known as CIGS. These CIGS films have been grown by physical vapour deposition in a three-stage co-evaporation process. In this process In, Ga and Se are evaporated in the first step; in the second step it is followed by Cu and Se co-evaporation and in the last step terminated by In, Ga and Se evaporation again.     [ edit ]   Applications and implementations          Polycrystaline PV cells laminated to backing material in a PV module              Polycrystalline PV cells           Main article:  photovoltaic array       Solar cells are often electrically connected and encapsulated as a  module . PV modules often have a sheet of glass on the front (sun up) side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor  wafers  from the elements ( rain ,  hail , etc.). Solar cells are also usually connected in  series  in modules, creating an additive  voltage . Connecting cells in parallel will yield a higher current. Modules are then interconnected, in series or parallel, or both, to create an  array  with the desired peak DC voltage and current.   The power output of a solar array is measured in  watts  or  kilowatts . In order to calculate the typical energy needs of the application, a measurement in  watt-hours , kilowatt-hours or kilowatt-hours per day is often used. A common  rule of thumb  is that average power is equal to 20% of peak power, so that each peak kilowatt of solar array output power corresponds to energy production of 4.8 kWh per day (24 hours x 1kWh x 20% = 4.8 kWh)   To make practical use of the solar-generated energy, the electricity is most often fed into the electricity grid using inverters (grid-connected PV systems); in stand alone systems, batteries are used to store the energy that is not needed immediately.     [ edit ]   Theory     See also:  Photoelectric effect       [ edit ]   Simple explanation     Photons  in  sunlight  hit the solar panel and are absorbed by semiconducting materials, such as  silicon .   Electrons  (negatively charged) are knocked loose from their atoms, allowing them to flow through the material to produce  electricity . Due to the special composition of solar cells, the electrons are only allowed to move in a single direction. The complementary positive charges that are also created (like bubbles) are called  holes  and flow in the direction opposite of the electrons in a silicon solar panel.   An array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of  direct current  (DC) electricity.       [ edit ]   Photogeneration of charge carriers   When a  photon  hits a piece of silicon, one of three things can happen:     the photon can pass straight through the silicon  this (generally) happens for lower energy photons,   the photon can reflect off the surface,   the photon can be absorbed by the silicon, if the photon energy is higher than the silicon  band gap  value. This generates an electron-hole pair and sometimes heat, depending on the band structure.     When a photon is absorbed, its energy is given to an electron in the crystal lattice. Usually this electron is in the  valence band , and is tightly bound in covalent bonds between neighboring atoms, and hence unable to move far. The energy given to it by the photon ""excites"" it into the  conduction band , where it is free to move around within the semiconductor. The covalent bond that the electron was previously a part of now has one fewer electron  this is known as a hole. The presence of a missing covalent bond allows the bonded electrons of neighboring atoms to move into the ""hole,"" leaving another hole behind, and in this way a hole can move through the lattice. Thus, it can be said that photons absorbed in the semiconductor create mobile electron-hole pairs.   A photon need only have greater energy than that of the band gap in order to excite an electron from the valence band into the conduction band. However, the solar  frequency spectrum  approximates a  black body  spectrum at ~6000 K, and as such, much of the solar radiation reaching the  Earth  is composed of photons with energies greater than the band gap of silicon. These higher energy photons will be absorbed by the solar cell, but the difference in energy between these photons and the silicon band gap is converted into heat (via lattice vibrations  called  phonons ) rather than into usable electrical energy.     [ edit ]   Charge carrier separation   There are two main modes for charge carrier separation in a solar cell:     drift  of carriers, driven by an electrostatic field established across the device   diffusion  of carriers from zones of high carrier concentration to zones of low carrier concentration (following a gradient of electrochemical potential).     In the widely used  p-n junction  solar cells, the dominant mode of charge carrier separation is by drift. However, in non-p-n-junction solar cells (typical of the  third generation solar cell  research such as  dye  and  polymer solar cells ), a general electrostatic field has been confirmed to be absent, and the dominant mode of separation is via  charge carrier diffusion . [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   The p-n junction       Main articles:  semiconductor  and  p-n junction       The most commonly known solar cell is configured as a large-area  p-n junction  made from silicon. As a simplification, one can imagine bringing a layer of n-type silicon into direct contact with a layer of p-type silicon. In practice, p-n junctions of silicon solar cells are not made in this way, but rather, by diffusing an n-type dopant into one side of a p-type wafer (or vice versa).   If a piece of p-type silicon is placed in intimate contact with a piece of n-type silicon, then a  diffusion  of electrons occurs from the region of high electron concentration (the n-type side of the junction) into the region of low electron concentration (p-type side of the junction). When the electrons diffuse across the p-n junction, they recombine with holes on the p-type side. The diffusion of carriers does not happen indefinitely however, because of an  electric field  which is created by the imbalance of charge immediately on either side of the junction which this diffusion creates. The electric field established across the p-n junction creates a  diode  that promotes  current  in only one direction across the junction. Electrons may pass from the n-type side into the p-type side, and holes may pass from the p-type side to the n-type side, but not the other way around. [ 20 ]  This region where electrons have diffused across the junction is called the  depletion region  because it no longer contains any mobile charge carriers. It is also known as the ""space charge region"".     [ edit ]   Connection to an external load   Ohmic   metal -semiconductor contacts are made to both the n-type and p-type sides of the solar cell, and the electrodes connected to an external load. Electrons that are created on the n-type side, or have been ""collected"" by the junction and swept onto the n-type side, may travel through the wire, power the load, and continue through the wire until they reach the p-type semiconductor-metal contact. Here, they recombine with a hole that was either created as an electron-hole pair on the p-type side of the solar cell, or are swept across the junction from the n-type side after being created there.   The voltage measured is equal to the difference in the  quasi Fermi levels  of the minority carriers ie. electrons in the p-type portion, and holes in the n-type portion.     [ edit ]   Equivalent circuit of a solar cell          The equivalent circuit of a solar cell              The schematic symbol of a solar cell       To understand the electronic behavior of a solar cell, it is useful to create a  model  which is electrically equivalent, and is based on discrete electrical components whose behavior is well known. An ideal solar cell may be modelled by a current source in parallel with a  diode ; in practice no solar cell is ideal, so a shunt resistance and a series resistance component are added to the model. [ 21 ]  The resulting equivalent circuit of a solar cell is shown on the left. Also shown, on the right, is the schematic representation of a solar cell for use in circuit diagrams.     [ edit ]   Characteristic equation   From the equivalent circuit it is evident that the current produced by the solar cell is equal to that produced by the current source, minus that which flows through the diode, minus that which flows through the shunt resistor: [ 22 ] [ 23 ]     I  =  I L    I D    I S H     where     I  = output current ( amperes )   I L  = photogenerated current (amperes)   I D  = diode current (amperes)   I S H  = shunt current (amperes)     The current flowing through these elements governed by the voltage across them:     V j  =  V  +  I R S     where     V  = voltage across the output terminals ( volts )   I  = output current (amperes)   R S  = series resistance (  )     By the  Shockley diode equation , the current diverted through the diode is:         where     I 0  = reverse  saturation current  (amperes)   n  = diode ideality factor (1 for an ideal diode)   q  =  elementary charge   k  =  Boltzmann's constant   T  =  absolute temperature   For silicon at 25C,   volts.     By  Ohm's law , the current diverted through the shunt resistor is:         where     R S H  = shunt resistance ()     Substituting these into the first equation produces the characteristic equation of a solar cell, which relates solar cell parameters to the output current and voltage:         An alternative derivation produces an equation similar in appearance, but with  V  on the left-hand side. The two alternatives are  identities ; that is, they yield precisely the same results.   In principle, given a particular operating voltage  V  the equation may be solved to determine the operating current  I  at that voltage. However, because the equation involves  I  on both sides in a  transcendental function  the equation has no general analytical solution. However, even without a solution it is physically instructive. Furthermore, it is easily solved using  numerical methods . (A general analytical solution to the equation is possible using  Lambert's W  function, but since Lambert's W generally itself must be solved numerically this is a technicality.)   Since the parameters  I 0 ,  n ,  R S , and  R S H  cannot be measured directly, the most common application of the characteristic equation is  nonlinear regression  to extract the values of these parameters on the basis of their combined effect on solar cell behavior.     [ edit ]   Effect of physical size   The values of  I 0 ,  R S , and  R S H  are dependent upon the physical size of the solar cell. In comparing otherwise identical cells, a cell with twice the surface area of another will, in principle, have double the  I 0  because it has twice the junction area across which current can leak. It will also have half the  R S  and  R S H  because it has twice the cross-sectional area through which current can flow. For this reason, the characteristic equation is frequently written in terms of  current density , or current produced per unit cell area:         where     J  = current density (amperes/cm 2 )   J L  = reverse saturation current density (amperes/cm 2 )   r S  = specific series resistance (-cm 2 )   r S H  = specific shunt resistance (-cm 2 )     This formulation has several advantages. One is that since cell characteristics are referenced to a common cross-sectional area they may be compared for cells of different physical dimensions. While this is of limited benefit in a manufacturing setting, where all cells tend to be the same size, it is useful in research and in comparing cells between manufacturers. Another advantage is that the density equation naturally scales the parameter values to similar orders of magnitude, which can make numerical extraction of them simpler and more accurate even with naive solution methods.   A practical limitation of this formulation is that as cell sizes shrink, certain parasitic effects grow in importance and can affect the extracted parameter values. For example, recombination and contamination of the junction tend to be greatest at the perimeter of the cell, so very small cells may exhibit higher values of  J 0  or lower values of  r S H  than larger cells that are otherwise identical. In such cases, comparisons between cells must be made cautiously and with these effects in mind.     [ edit ]   Cell temperature          Effect of temperature on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell       Temperature affects the characteristic equation in two ways: directly, via  T  in the exponential term, and indirectly via its effect on  I 0 . (Strictly speaking, temperature affects all of the terms, but these two far more significantly than the others.) While increasing  T  reduces the magnitude of the exponent in the characteristic equation, the value of  I 0  increases in proportion to  exp T . The net effect is to reduce  V O C  linearly with increasing temperature. The magnitude of this reduction is inversely proportional to  V O C ; that is, cells with higher values of  V O C  suffer smaller reductions in voltage with increasing temperature. For most crystalline silicon solar cells the reduction is about 0.50%/C, though the rate for the highest-efficiency crystalline silicon cells is around 0.35%/C. By way of comparison, the rate for amorphous silicon solar cells is 0.20-0.30%/C, depending on how the cell is made.   The amount of photogenerated current  I L  increases slightly with increasing temperature because of an increase in the number of thermally generated carriers in the cell. This effect is slight, however: about 0.065%/C for crystalline silicon cells and 0.09% for amorphous silicon cells.   The overall effect of temperature on cell efficiency can be computed using these factors in combination with the characteristic equation. However, since the change in voltage is much stronger than the change in current, the overall effect on efficiency tends to be similar to that on voltage. Most crystalline silicon solar cells decline in efficiency by 0.50%/C and most amorphous cells decline by 0.15-0.25%/C. The figure to the right shows I-V curves that might typically be seen for a crystalline silicon solar cell at various temperatures.     [ edit ]   Series resistance          Effect of series resistance on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell       As series resistance increases, the voltage drop between the junction voltage and the terminal voltage becomes greater for the same flow of current. The result is that the current-controlled portion of the I-V curve begins to sag toward the origin, producing a significant decrease in the terminal voltage  V  and a slight reduction in  I S C . Very high values of  R S  will also produce a significant reduction in  I S C ; in these regimes, series resistance dominates and the behavior of the solar cell resembles that of a resistor. These effects are shown for crystalline silicon solar cells in the I-V curves displayed in the figure to the right.     [ edit ]   Shunt resistance          Effect of shunt resistance on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell       As shunt resistance decreases, the flow of current diverted through the shunt resistor increases for a given level of junction voltage. The result is that the voltage-controlled portion of the I-V curve begins to sag toward the origin, producing a significant decrease in the terminal current  I  and a slight reduction in  V O C . Very low values of  R S H  will produce a significant reduction in  V O C . Much as in the case of a high series resistance, a badly shunted solar cell will take on operating characteristics similar to those of a resistor. These effects are shown for crystalline silicon solar cells in the I-V curves displayed in the figure to the right.     [ edit ]   Reverse saturation current          Effect of reverse saturation current on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell       If one assumes infinite shunt resistance, the characteristic equation can be solved for  V O C :         Thus, an increase in  I 0  produces a reduction in  V O C  proportional to the inverse of the logarithm of the increase. This explains mathematically the reason for the reduction in  V O C  that accompanies increases in temperature described above. The effect of reverse saturation current on the I-V curve of a crystalline silicon solar cell are shown in the figure to the right. Physically, reverse saturation current is a measure of the ""leakage"" of carriers across the p-n junction in reverse bias. This leakage is a result of carrier recombination in the neutral regions on either side of the junction.     [ edit ]   Ideality factor          Effect of ideality factor on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell       The ideality factor (also called the emissivity factor) is a fitting parameter that describes how closely the diode's behavior matches that predicted by theory, which assumes the p-n junction of the diode is an infinite plane and no recombination occurs within the space-charge region. A perfect match to theory is indicated when  n  = 1 . When recombination in the space-charge region dominate other recombination, however,  n  = 2 . The effect of changing ideality factor independently of all other parameters is shown for a crystalline silicon solar cell in the I-V curves displayed in the figure to the right.   Most solar cells, which are quite large compared to conventional diodes, well approximate an infinite plane and will usually exhibit near-ideal behavior under  Standard Test Condition  ( ). Under certain operating conditions, however, device operation may be dominated by recombination in the space-charge region. This is characterized by a significant increase in  I 0  as well as an increase in ideality factor to  . The latter tends to erode solar cell output voltage while the former acts to increase it. The net effect, therefore, is a combination of the increase in voltage shown for increasing  n  in the figure to the right and the decrease in voltage shown for increasing  I 0  in the figure above. Typically,  I 0  is the more significant factor and the result is a reduction in voltage.     [ edit ]   Solar cell efficiency factors     [ edit ]   Energy conversion efficiency       Main articles:  Energy conversion efficiency  and  High efficiency solar cells       A solar cell's  energy conversion efficiency  (  , ""eta""), is the percentage of power converted (from absorbed light to electrical energy) and collected, when a solar cell is connected to an electrical circuit. This term is calculated using the ratio of the maximum power point,  P m , divided by the input light  irradiance  ( E , in W/m 2 ) under standard test conditions (STC) and the  surface area  of the solar cell ( A c  in m 2 ).         STC specifies a temperature of 25C and an irradiance of 1000 W/m 2  with an air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) spectrum. These correspond to the irradiance and spectrum of sunlight incident on a clear day upon a sun-facing 37-tilted surface with the sun at an angle of 41.81 above the horizon. [ 24 ] [ 25 ]  This condition approximately represents solar noon near the spring and autumn equinoxes in the continental United States with surface of the cell aimed directly at the sun. Thus, under these conditions a solar cell of 12% efficiency with a 100 cm 2  (0.01 m 2 ) surface area can be expected to produce approximately 1.2 watts of power.   The losses of a solar cell may be broken down into reflectance losses, thermodynamic efficiency, recombination losses and resistive electrical loss. The overall efficiency is the product of each of these individual losses.   Due to the difficulty in measuring these parameters directly, other parameters are measured instead: Thermodynamic Efficiency, Quantum Efficiency, V OC  ratio, and Fill Factor. Reflectance losses are a portion of the Quantum Efficiency under ""External Quantum Efficiency"". Recombination losses make up a portion of the Quantum Efficiency, V OC  ratio, and Fill Factor. Resistive losses are predominantly categorized under Fill Factor, but also make up minor portions of the Quantum Efficiency, V OC  ratio.   Generally, solar cells on the market today do not produce much electricity from  ultraviolet  light, instead it is either filtered out or absorbed by the cell, heating the cell. That heat is wasted energy and could even lead to damage to the cell. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Thermodynamic Efficiency Limit   Solar cells operate as quantum energy conversion devices, and are therefore subject to the ""Thermodynamic Efficiency Limit"". Photons with an energy below the band gap of the absorber material cannot generate a hole-electron pair, and so their energy is not converted to useful output and only generates heat if absorbed. For photons with an energy above the band gap energy, only a fraction of the energy above the band gap can be converted to useful output. When a photon of greater energy is absorbed, the excess energy above the band gap is converted to kinetic energy of the carrier combination. The excess kinetic energy is converted to heat through phonon interactions as the kinetic energy of the carriers slows to equilibrium velocity.   Solar cells with multiple band gap absorber materials are able to more efficiently convert the solar spectrum. By using multiple band gaps, the solar spectrum may be broken down into smaller bins where the thermodynamic efficiency limit is higher for each bin. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Quantum efficiency       Main article:  Quantum efficiency of a solar cell       As described above, when a photon is absorbed by a solar cell it can produce a pair of free charge carriers, i.e. an electron-hole pair. One of the carriers (the minority carrier) may then be able to reach the p-n junction and contribute to the current produced by the solar cell; such a carrier is said to be  collected . Alternatively, the carrier may give up its energy and once again become bound to an atom within the solar cell  without being collected ; this process is then called  recombination  since one electron and one hole recombine and thereby annihilate the associated free charge. The carriers that recombine do  not contribute  to the generation of electrical current.   Quantum efficiency  refers to the percentage of photons that are converted to electric current (i.e., collected carriers) when the cell is operated under short circuit conditions.  External  quantum efficiency (EQE) is the fraction of  incident  photons that are converted to electrical current, while  internal  quantum efficiency (IQE) is the fraction of  absorbed  photons that are converted to electrical current. Mathematically, internal quantum efficiency is related to external quantum efficiency by the reflectance (R) and the transmittance (T) of the solar cell by  I Q E  =  E Q E  / (1   R    T ) . Please note that for a thick bulk Si solar cell T is approximately zero and is therefore in practical cases often neglected.   Quantum efficiency should not be confused with  energy conversion efficiency , as it does not convey information about the fraction of power that is converted by the solar cell. Furthermore, quantum efficiency is most usefully expressed as a  spectral  measurement (that is, as a function of photon wavelength or energy). Since some wavelengths are absorbed more effectively than others in most semiconductors, spectral measurements of quantum efficiency can yield valuable information about which parts of a particular solar cell design are most in need of improvement. Spectral quantum efficiency measurements also allow determining important solar cell parameters such as the base diffusion length.     [ edit ]   Maximum-power point   A solar cell may operate over a wide range of  voltages  (V) and  currents  (I). By increasing the resistive load on an irradiated cell continuously from zero (a  short circuit ) to a very high value (an  open circuit ) one can determine the  maximum-power  point, the point that maximizes VI; that is, the load for which the cell can deliver maximum electrical power at that level of irradiation. (The output power is zero in both the short circuit and open circuit extremes).   A high quality, monocrystalline silicon solar cell, at 25 C cell temperature, may produce 0.60 volts open-circuit (Voc). The cell temperature in full sunlight, even with 25 C air temperature, will probably be close to 45 C, reducing the open-circuit voltage to 0.55 volts per cell. The voltage drops modestly, with this type of cell, until the short-circuit current is approached (Isc). Maximum power (with 45 C cell temperature) is typically produced with 75% to 80% of the open-circuit voltage (0.43 volts in this case) and 90% of the short-circuit current. This output can be up to 70% of the Voc x Isc product. The short-circuit current (Isc) from a cell is nearly proportional to the illumination, while the open-circuit voltage (Voc) may drop only 10% with a 80% drop in illumination. Lower-quality cells have a more rapid drop in voltage with increasing current and could produce only 1/2 Voc at 1/2 Isc. The usable power output could thus drop from 70% of the Voc x Isc product to 50% or even as little as 25%. Vendors who rate their solar cell ""power"" only as Voc x Isc, without giving load curves, can be seriously distorting their actual performance.   The maximum power point of a  photovoltaic  varies with incident illumination. For systems large enough to justify the extra expense, a  maximum power point tracker  tracks the instantaneous power by continually measuring the  voltage  and  current  (and hence, power transfer), and uses this information to dynamically adjust the load so the maximum power is  always  transferred, regardless of the variation in lighting.     [ edit ]   Fill factor   Another defining term in the overall behavior of a solar cell is the  fill factor  ( FF ). This is the ratio of the  maximum power point  divided by the  open circuit voltage  ( V oc ) and the  short circuit current  ( I sc ):           [ edit ]   Comparison of energy conversion efficiencies       Main article:  Photovoltaics       At this point, discussion of the different ways to calculate efficiency for space cells and terrestrial cells is necessary to alleviate confusion. In space, where there is no atmosphere, the spectrum of the sun is relatively unfiltered. However, on earth, with air filtering the incoming light, the solar spectrum changes. To account for the spectral differences, a system was devised to calculate this filtering effect. Simply, the filtering effect ranges from  Air Mass  0 (AM0) in space, to approximately Air Mass 1.5 on earth. Multiplying the spectral differences by the quantum efficiency of the solar cell in question will yield the efficiency of the device. For example, a Silicon solar cell in space might have an efficiency of 14% at AM0, but have an efficiency of 16% on earth at AM 1.5. Terrestrial efficiencies typically are greater than space efficiencies.   Solar cell efficiencies vary from 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 40.7% with multiple-junction research lab cells and 42.8% with multiple dies assembled into a hybrid package. [ 28 ]  Solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available  multicrystalline Si  solar cells are around 14-19%. [ 29 ]  The highest efficiency cells have not always been the most economical  for example a 30% efficient multijunction cell based on exotic materials such as gallium arsenide or indium selenide and produced in low volume might well cost one hundred times as much as an 8% efficient amorphous silicon cell in mass production, while only delivering about four times the electrical power.   However, there is a way to ""boost"" solar power. By increasing the light intensity, typically photogenerated carriers are increased, resulting in increased efficiency by up to 15%. These so-called ""concentrator systems"" have only begun to become cost-competitive as a result of the development of high efficiency GaAs cells. The increase in intensity is typically accomplished by using concentrating optics. A typical concentrator system may use a light intensity 6-400 times the sun, and increase the efficiency of a one sun GaAs cell from 31% at AM 1.5 to 35%. See  Solar_cell#Concentrating photovoltaics (CPV)  below and  Concentrating solar power  (CSP).   A common method used to express economic costs of electricity-generating systems is to calculate a price per delivered  kilowatt-hour  (kWh). The solar cell efficiency in combination with the available irradiation has a major influence on the costs, but generally speaking the overall system efficiency is important. Using the commercially available solar cells (as of 2006) and system technology leads to system efficiencies between 5 and 19%. As of 2005, photovoltaic electricity generation costs ranged from ~0.60 US$/kWh (0.50 /kWh) (central Europe) down to ~0.30 US$/kWh (0.25 /kWh) in regions of high solar irradiation. This electricity is generally fed into the electrical grid on the customer's side of the meter. The cost can be compared to prevailing retail electric pricing (as of 2005), which varied from between 0.04 and 0.50 US$/kWh worldwide. (Note: in addition to solar irradiance profiles, these costs/kwh calculations will vary depending on assumptions for years of useful life of a system. Most c-Si panels are warranted for 25 years and should see 35+ years of useful life.)   The chart at the right illustrates the various commercial large-area module energy conversion efficiencies and the best laboratory efficiencies obtained for various materials and technologies.          Reported timeline of solar cell energy conversion efficiencies (from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (USA)         [ edit ]   Watts peak       Main article:  kilowatt-peak       Since solar cell output power depends on multiple factors, such as the  sun 's  incidence angle , for comparison purposes between different cells and panels, the measure of watts peak (Wp) is used. It is the output power under these conditions known as  STC : [ 30 ] [ 22 ]  Larger panels use the same rating system, but use kWp (1000 watts peak).     insolation  (solar  irradiance ) 1000 W/m 2   solar reference spectrum AM ( airmass ) 1.5   cell temperature 25 C       [ edit ]   Solar cells and energy payback   Further information:  Low cost solar cell   Energy payback is the recovery (period) of the energy spent for manufacturing of the respective  technical energy systems , also called harvesting ratio ( ISO 13602 ).   In the 1990s, when silicon cells were twice as thick, efficiencies were 30% lower than today and lifetimes were shorter, it may well have cost more energy to make a cell than it could generate in a lifetime. In the meantime, the technology has progressed significantly, and the energy payback time of a modern photovoltaic module is typically from 1 to 4 years [ 8 ] [ 31 ]  depending on the type and where it is used (see  net energy gain ). Generally, thin film technologies - despite having comparatively low conversion efficiencies - achieve significantly shorter energy payback times than conventional systems (often < 1 year). [ 32 ]  With a typical lifetime of 20 to 30 years, this means that modern solar cells are net energy producers, i.e. they generate significantly more energy over their lifetime than the energy expended in producing them. [ 33 ] [ 8 ] [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Light-absorbing materials       Main article:  Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)       All solar cells require a  light absorbing material  contained within the cell structure to absorb photons and generate electrons via the  photoelectric effect . The materials used in solar cells tend to have the property of preferentially absorbing the wavelengths of solar light that reach the earth surface; however, some solar cells are optimized for light absorption beyond Earth's atmosphere as well. Light absorbing materials can often be used in  multiple physical configurations  to take advantage of different light absorption and charge separation mechanisms.   Photovoltaic panels are normally made of either silicon or thin-film cells:   Many currently available solar cells are configured as  bulk  materials that are subsequently cut into  wafers  and treated in a ""top-down"" method of synthesis ( silicon  being the most prevalent bulk material).   Other materials are configured as  thin-films  (inorganic  layers , organic  dyes , and organic  polymers ) that are deposited on  supporting substrates , while a third group are configured as  nanocrystals  and used as  quantum dots  (electron-confined  nanoparticles ) embedded in a supporting matrix in a ""bottom-up"" approach. Silicon remains the only material that is well-researched in both  bulk  (also called wafer-based) and  thin-film  configurations.   There are many new alternatives to Silicon photocells. Proprietary nanoparticle  silicon printing  processes promises many of the photovoltaic features that conventional silicon can never achieve. It can be printed  reel-to-reel  on  stainless steel  or other high temperature substrates. [ 35 ]  However, most of the work on the next generation of photovoltaics is directed at printing onto low cost flexible  polymer film  and ultimately on common  packaging materials . The main contenders are currently  CIGS ,  CdTe ,  DSSC  and  organic photovoltaics . [ 35 ]   The following is a current list of light absorbing materials, listed by configuration and substance-name:     [ edit ]   Bulk   These  bulk  technologies are often referred to as  wafer -based manufacturing. In other words, in each of these approaches, self-supporting wafers between 180 to 240 micrometers thick are processed and then soldered together to form a solar cell module. A general description of silicon wafer processing is provided in  Manufacture and Devices .     [ edit ]   Crystalline silicon       Main articles:  Crystalline silicon ,  Silicon , and  list of silicon producers              Basic structure of a silicon based solar cell and its working mechanism.       By far, the most prevalent  bulk  material for solar cells is  crystalline   silicon  (abbreviated as a group as  c-Si ), also known as ""solar grade silicon"". Bulk silicon is separated into multiple categories according to crystallinity and crystal size in the resulting  ingot ,  ribbon , or  wafer .     monocrystalline silicon  (c-Si): often made using the  Czochralski process . Single-crystal wafer cells tend to be expensive, and because they are cut from cylindrical ingots, do not completely cover a square solar cell module without a substantial waste of refined silicon. Hence most  c-Si  panels have uncovered gaps at the four corners of the cells.    Ribbon silicon [ 36 ]  is a type of monocrystalline silicon: it is formed by drawing flat thin films from  molten  silicon and having a  multicrystalline  structure. These cells have lower efficiencies than poly-Si, but save on production costs due to a great reduction in  silicon waste , as this approach does not require  sawing  from  ingots .       Poly- or  multicrystalline silicon  (poly-Si or mc-Si): made from cast square ingots  large blocks of molten silicon carefully cooled and solidified. Poly-Si cells are less expensive to produce than single crystal silicon cells, but are less efficient.  US DOE  data shows that there were a higher number of multicrystalline sales than monocrystalline silicon sales.     Crystalline silicon has an average 15% efficiency.   Silicon solar cells are wide area silicon. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Thin films       Main article:  Thin film       The various  thin-film  technologies currently being developed reduce the amount (or mass) of  light absorbing material  required in creating a  solar cell . This can lead to reduced processing costs from that of bulk materials (in the case of silicon thin films) but also tends to reduce  energy conversion efficiency  (an average 7 to 10% efficiency), although many  multi-layer  thin films have efficiencies above those of bulk  silicon wafers .   They have become popular compared to wafer silicon due to lower costs and advantages including flexibility, lighter weights, and ease of integration.     [ edit ]   Cadmium telluride solar cell       Main article:  Cadmium telluride photovoltaics       A  cadmium telluride solar cell  is a solar cell based on  cadmium telluride , an efficient light-absorbing material for  thin-film cells . Compared to other thin-film materials, CdTe is easier to deposit and more suitable for  large-scale production .   Despite much discussion of the toxicity of CdTe-based solar cells, this is the only technology (apart from  amorphous silicon ) that can be delivered on a large scale. [ 38 ]  The perception of the toxicity of CdTe is based on the toxicity of elemental  cadmium , a heavy metal that is a  cumulative poison . However it has been shown that the release of cadmium to the atmosphere is lower with CdTe-based solar cells than with  silicon photovoltaics  and other thin-film solar cell technologies. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Copper-Indium Selenide       Main article:  Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell                   Possible combinations of (I, III, VI) elements in the periodic table that have photovoltaic effect             The materials based on CuInSe 2  that are of interest for photovoltaic applications include several elements from groups I, III and VI in the periodic table. These semiconductors are especially attractive for thin film solar cell application because of their high optical absorption coefficients and versatile optical and electrical characteristics which can in principle be manipulated and tuned for a specific need in a given device. CIS is an abbreviation for general chalcopyrite films of copper indium selenide ( C u I n S e 2 ), CIGS mentioned below is a variation of CIS. CIS films (no Ga) achieved greater than 14% efficiency. [ 40 ]  However, manufacturing costs of CIS solar cells at present are high when compared with amorphous silicon solar cells but continuing work is leading to more cost-effective production processes. The first large-scale production of CIS modules was started in 2006 in Germany by  Wuerth Solar .   When gallium is substituted for some of the indium in CIS, the material is referred to as CIGS, or  copper indium/gallium diselenide , a solid mixture of the semiconductors CuInSe 2  and CuGaSe 2 , often abbreviated by the chemical formula CuIn x Ga (1-x) Se 2 . Unlike the conventional silicon based solar cell, which can be modelled as a simple p-n junction (see under  semiconductor ), these cells are best described by a more complex heterojunction model. The best efficiency of a thin-film solar cell as of March 2008 was 19.9% with CIGS absorber layer. [ 41 ]  Higher efficiencies (around 30%) can be obtained by using optics to concentrate the incident light or by using multi-junction tandem solar cells. The use of gallium increases the optical bandgap of the CIGS layer as compared to pure CIS, thus increasing the open-circuit voltage, but decreasing the short circuit current. In another point of view, gallium is added to replace indium due to gallium's relative availability to indium. Approximately 70% [ 42 ]  of indium currently produced is used by the flat-screen monitor industry. However, the atomic ratio for Ga in the >19% efficient CIGS solar cells is ~7%, which corresponds to a bandgap of ~1.15 eV. CIGS solar cells with higher Ga amounts have lower efficiency. For example, CGS solar cells (which have a bandgap of ~1.7eV have a record efficiency of 9.5% for pure CGS and 10.2% for surface-modified CGS. Some investors in solar technology worry that production of CIGS cells will be limited by the availability of indium. Producing 2 GW of CIGS cells (roughly the amount of silicon cells produced in 2006) would use about 10% of the indium produced in 2004. [ 43 ]  For comparison, silicon solar cells used up 33% of the world's electronic grade silicon production in 2006.  Nanosolar  claims to waste only 5% of the indium it uses. As of 2006, the best conversion efficiency for flexible CIGS cells on polyimide is 14.1% by Tiwari et al, at the ETH, Switzerland. Comparable efficiencies have been reported on other flexible substrates.   That being said, indium can easily be recycled from decommissioned PV modules. The recycling program in Germany is an example that highlights the regenerative industrial paradigm: ""From  cradle to cradle "".   Se allows for better uniformity across the layer and so the number of recombination sites in the film are reduced which benefits the quantum efficiency and thus the conversion efficiency.

[ 44 ]  These multijunction cells consist of multiple thin films produced using  Metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy . A triple-junction cell, for example, may consist of the semiconductors:  GaAs ,  Ge , and  GaInP 2 . [ 45 ]  Each type of semiconductor will have a characteristic  band gap  energy which, loosely speaking, causes it to absorb light most efficiently at a certain color, or more precisely, to absorb  electromagnetic radiation  over a portion of the spectrum. The semiconductors are carefully chosen to absorb nearly all of the solar spectrum, thus generating electricity from as much of the solar energy as possible.   GaAs based multijunction devices are the most efficient solar cells to date, reaching a record high of 40.7% efficiency under solar concentration and laboratory conditions. [ 46 ]   This technology is currently being utilized in the Mars rover missions.   Tandem solar cells based on monolithic, series connected, gallium indium phosphide (GaInP), gallium arsenide GaAs, and germanium Ge pn junctions, are seeing demand rapidly rise. In just the past 12 months (12/2006 - 12/2007), the cost of 4N gallium metal has risen from about $350 per kg to $680 per kg. Additionally, germanium metal prices have risen substantially to $1000-$1200 per kg this year. Those materials include gallium (4N, 6N and 7N Ga), arsenic (4N, 6N and 7N) and germanium, pyrolitic boron nitride (pBN) crucibles for growing crystals, and boron oxide, these products are critical to the entire substrate manufacturing industry.   Triple-junction GaAs solar cells were also being used as the power source of the Dutch four-time  World Solar Challenge  winners  Nuna  in 2005 and 2007, and also by the Dutch solar cars Solutra (2005) and Twente One (2007).   The Dutch  Radboud University Nijmegen  set the record for thin film solar cell effiency using a single junction GaAs to 25.8% in August 2008 using only 4 m thick GaAs layer which can be transferred from a wafer base to glass or plastic film. [ 47 ]     [ edit ]   Light-absorbing dyes (DSSC)       Main article:  Dye-sensitized solar cells       Typically a  ruthenium   metalorganic   dye  ( Ru-centered ) is used as a  monolayer  of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a  mesoporous  layer of  nanoparticulate   titanium dioxide  to greatly amplify the surface area (200-300 m 2 /g TiO 2 , as compared to approximately 10 m 2 /g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the  light absorbing dye  are passed on to the  n-type  TiO 2 , and the holes are passed to an  electrolyte  on the other side of the dye. The circuit is completed by a redox couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows a more flexible use of materials, and is typically manufactured by  screen printing , with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for  bulk  solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from  degradation  under heat and  UV  light, and the cell casing is difficult to  seal  due to the solvents used in assembly. In spite of the above, this is a popular emerging technology with some commercial impact forecast within this decade.     [ edit ]   Organic/polymer solar cells   Organic solar cells  and  Polymer solar cells  are built from thin films (typically 100 nm) of  organic semiconductors  such as polymers and small-molecule compounds like  polyphenylene vinylene , copper phthalocyanine (a blue or green organic pigment) and  carbon fullerenes  and fullerene derivatives such as  PCBM . Energy conversion efficiencies achieved to date using conductive polymers are low compared to inorganic materials, with the highest reported efficiency of 6.5% [ 48 ]  for a tandem cell architecture. However, these cells could be beneficial for some applications where mechanical flexibility and disposability are important.   These devices differ from inorganic semiconductor solar cells in that they do not rely on the large built-in electric field of a PN junction to separate the electrons and holes created when photons are absorbed. The active region of an organic device consists of two materials, one which acts as an electron donor and the other as an acceptor. When a photon is converted into an electron hole pair, typically in the donor material, the charges tend to remain bound in the form of an  exciton , and are separated when the exciton diffuses to the donor-acceptor interface. The short exciton diffusion lengths of most polymer systems tend to limit the efficiency of such devices. Nanostructured interfaces, sometimes in the form of bulk heterojunctions, can improve performance. [ 49 ]     [ edit ]   Silicon Thin Films   Silicon thin-film cells  are mainly deposited by  chemical vapor deposition  (typically plasma-enhanced (PE-CVD)) from  silane  gas and  hydrogen  gas. Depending on the deposition parameters, this can yield:     Amorphous silicon  (a-Si or a-Si:H)   Protocrystalline  silicon or   Nanocrystalline silicon  (nc-Si or nc-Si:H), also called microcrystalline silicon.     These types of silicon present dangling and twisted bonds, which results in deep defects (energy levels in the bandgap) as well as deformation of the valence and conduction bands (band tails). The solar cells made from these materials tend to have lower  energy conversion efficiency  than  bulk  silicon, but are also less expensive to produce. The  quantum efficiency  of thin film solar cells is also lower due to reduced number of collected charge carriers per incident photon.   Amorphous silicon has a higher bandgap (1.7 eV) than crystalline silicon (c-Si) (1.1 eV), which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar spectrum more strongly than the  infrared  portion of the spectrum. As  nc-Si  has about the same bandgap as c-Si, the nc-Si and a-Si can advantageously be combined in thin layers, creating a layered cell called a  tandem cell . The top cell in a-Si absorbs the visible light and leaves the infrared part of the spectrum for the bottom cell in nanocrystalline Si.   Recently, solutions to overcome the limitations of thin-film crystalline silicon have been developed. Light trapping schemes where the weakly absorbed long wavelength light is obliquely coupled into the silicon and traverses the film several times can significantly enhance the absorption of sunlight in the thin silicon films. [ 50 ]  Thermal processing techniques can significantly enhance the crystal quality of the silicon and thereby lead to higher efficiencies of the final solar cells. [ 51 ]   A silicon thin film technology is being developed for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) in the form of semi-transparent solar cells which can be applied as window glazing. These cells function as window tinting while generating electricity.     [ edit ]   Nanocrystalline solar cells       Main article:  Nanocrystal solar cell       These structures make use of some of the same thin-film light absorbing materials but are overlain as an extremely thin absorber on a supporting matrix of conductive polymer or mesoporous metal oxide having a very high surface area to increase internal reflections (and hence increase the probability of light absorption). Using nanocrystals allows one to design architectures on the length scale of nanometers, the typical exciton diffusion length. In particular, single-nanocrystal ('channel') devices, an array of single p-n junctions between the electrodes and separated by a period of about a diffusion length, represent a new architecture for solar cells and potentially high efficiency.     [ edit ]   Concentrating photovoltaics (CPV)   Concentrating photovoltaic systems  use a large area of lenses or mirrors to focus sunlight on a small area of photovoltaic cells. [ 52 ]  If these systems use single or dual-axis tracking to improve performance, they may be referred to as  Heliostat Concentrator Photovoltaics  (HCPV). The primary attraction of CPV systems is their reduced usage of semiconducting material which is expensive and currently in short supply. Additionally, increasing the concentration ratio improves the performance of general photovoltaic materials. [ 53 ]  Despite the advantages of CPV technologies their application has been limited by the costs of focusing, tracking and cooling equipment. On October 25, 2006, the  Australian  federal government and the  Victorian  state government together with photovoltaic technology company  Solar Systems  announced a project using this technology,  Solar power station in Victoria , planned to come online in 2008 and be completed by 2013. This plant, at 154 MW, would be ten times larger than the largest current photovoltaic plant in the world. [ 54 ]     [ edit ]   Silicon solar cell device manufacture          Solar powered scientific calculator       Because solar cells are semiconductor devices, they share many of the same processing and manufacturing techniques as other semiconductor devices such as  computer  and  memory   chips . However, the stringent requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor fabrication are a little more relaxed for solar cells. Most large-scale commercial solar cell factories today make screen printed poly-crystalline silicon solar cells. Single crystalline wafers which are used in the semiconductor industry can be made into excellent high efficiency solar cells, but they are generally considered to be too expensive for large-scale mass production.   Poly-crystalline silicon wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into very thin (180 to 350 micrometer) slices or wafers. The wafers are usually lightly  p-type  doped. To make a solar cell from the wafer, a surface diffusion of  n-type  dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a  p-n junction  a few hundred nanometers below the surface.   Antireflection coatings, which increase the amount of light coupled into the solar cell, are typically next applied. Over the past decade, silicon nitride has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the antireflection coating of choice because of its excellent surface passivation qualities (i.e., it prevents carrier recombination at the surface of the solar cell). It is typically applied in a layer several hundred nanometers thick using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like antireflection coatings, serve to increase the amount of light coupled into the cell. Such surfaces can usually only be formed on single-crystal silicon, though in recent years methods of forming them on multicrystalline silicon have been developed.   The wafer then has a full area metal contact made on the back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine ""fingers"" and larger ""busbars"" are screen-printed onto the front surface using a  silver  paste. The rear contact is also formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear side of the cell, though in some cell designs it is printed in a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in  ohmic contact  with the silicon. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected in series (and/or parallel) by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into  modules  or ""solar panels"". Solar panels have a sheet of  tempered glass  on the front, and a  polymer  encapsulation on the back. Tempered glass cannot be used with amorphous silicon cells because of the high temperatures during the deposition process.     [ edit ]   Lifespan   Most commercially available solar cells are capable of producing electricity for at least twenty years without a significant decrease in efficiency. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Costs   Cost is established in cost-per-watt and in cost-per-watt in 24 hours for infrared capable photovoltaic cells.     [ edit ]   Slicing costs   University of Utah  engineers devised a new way to  slice  thin  wafers  of the chemical element  germanium  for use in the most efficient type of solar power cells. The new method should lower the cost of such cells by reducing the waste and breakage of the brittle semiconductor. [ 55 ]     [ edit ]   Low Cost Solar Cell   Dye-sensitized solar cell  is considered the  low-cost solar cell .   This cell is extremely promising because it is made of low-cost materials and does not need elaborate apparatus to manufacture, so it can be made in a  DIY  way allowing more players to produce it than any other type of solar cell. In bulk it should be significantly less expensive than older  solid-state  cell designs. It can be engineered into flexible sheets. Although its  conversion efficiency  is less than the best  thin film cells , its  price/performance ratio  should be high enough to allow them to compete with  fossil fuel electrical generation .     [ edit ]   Current research on materials and devices     See also:  Timeline of solar cells     There are currently many research groups active in the field of  photovoltaics  in  universities  and research institutions around the world. This research can be divided into three areas: making current technology solar cells cheaper and/or more efficient to effectively compete with other energy sources; developing new technologies based on new solar cell architectural designs; and developing new materials to serve as light absorbers and charge carriers.     [ edit ]   Silicon processing   One way of reducing the cost is to develop cheaper methods of obtaining silicon that is sufficiently pure. Silicon is a very common element, but is normally bound in silica, or  silica sand . Processing silica (SiO 2 ) to produce silicon is a very high energy process - at current efficiencies, it takes over two years for a conventional solar cell to generate as much energy as was used to make the silicon it contains. [ 56 ]  More energy efficient methods of synthesis are not only beneficial to the solar industry, but also to industries surrounding silicon technology as a whole.   The current industrial production of silicon is via the reaction between carbon (charcoal) and silica at a temperature around 1700  degrees Celsius . In this process, known as carbothermic reduction, each tonne of silicon (metallurgical grade, about 98% pure) is produced with the emission of about 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide.   Solid silica can be directly converted (reduced) to pure silicon by electrolysis in a molten salt bath at a fairly mild temperature (800 to 900 degrees Celsius). [ 57 ] [ 58 ]  While this new process is in principle the same as the  FFC Cambridge Process  which was first discovered in late 1996, the interesting laboratory finding is that such electrolytic silicon is in the form of porous silicon which turns readily into a fine powder, (with a particle size of a few micrometres), and may therefore offer new opportunities for development of solar cell technologies.   Another approach is also to reduce the amount of silicon used and thus cost, is by micromachining wafers into very thin, virtually transparent layers that could be used as transparent architectural coverings. [ 59 ]  The technique involves taking a silicon wafer, typically 1 to 2 mm thick, and making a multitude of parallel, transverse slices across the wafer, creating a large number of slivers that have a thickness of 50 micrometres and a width equal to the thickness of the original wafer. These slices are rotated 90 degrees, so that the surfaces corresponding to the faces of the original wafer become the edges of the slivers. The result is to convert, for example, a 150 mm diameter, 2 mm-thick wafer having an exposed silicon surface area of about 175 cm 2  per side into about 1000 slivers having dimensions of 100 mm  2 mm  0.1 mm, yielding a total exposed silicon surface area of about 2000 cm 2  per side. As a result of this rotation, the electrical doping and contacts that were on the face of the wafer are located the edges of the sliver, rather than the front and rear as is the case with conventional wafer cells. This has the interesting effect of making the cell sensitive from both the front and rear of the cell (a property known as bifaciality). [ 60 ]  Using this technique, one silicon wafer is enough to build a 140 watt panel, compared to about 60 wafers needed for conventional modules of same power output.     [ edit ]   Thin-film processing       Main article:  Thin-film       Thin-film  photovoltaic cells can use less than 1% of the expensive raw material ( silicon  or other light absorbers) compared to  wafer  based solar cells, leading to a significant price drop per Watt peak capacity. There are many research groups around the world actively researching different thin-film approaches and/or materials. However, it remains to be seen if these solutions can achieve a similar market penetration as traditional bulk silicon solar modules. [ 61 ]   One particularly promising technology is  crystalline silicon  thin films on glass substrates. This technology combines the advantages of crystalline silicon as a solar cell material (abundance, non-toxicity, high efficiency,long-term stability) with the cost savings of using a thin-film approach. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]   Another interesting aspect of thin-film solar cells is the possibility to deposit the cells on all kind of materials, including  flexible substrates  ( PET  for example), which opens a new dimension for new applications. [ 64 ]     [ edit ]   Metamorphic Multijunction Solar Cell   The  National Renewable Energy Laboratory  won a  R&D Magazine 's  R&D 100 Awards  for its Metamorphic Multijunction Solar Cell, an ultra-light and flexible cell that converts solar energy with record efficiency. [ 65 ]   The ultra-light, highly efficient solar cell was developed at NREL and is being commercialized by Emcore Corp. [ 66 ]  of  Albuquerque, N.M. , in partnership with the  Air Force Research Laboratories Space Vehicles Directorate  at  Kirtland Air Force Base  in Albuquerque.   It represents a new class of solar cells with clear advantages in performance, engineering design, operation and cost. For decades, conventional cells have featured  wafers  of semiconducting materials with similar  crystalline  structure. Their performance and cost effectiveness is constrained by growing the cells in an upright configuration. Meanwhile, the cells are rigid, heavy and thick with a bottom layer made of  germanium .   In the new method, the cell is grown upside down. These layers use high-energy materials with extremely high quality crystals, especially in the upper layers of the cell where most of the power is produced. Not all of the layers follow the  lattice  pattern of even atomic spacing. Instead, the cell includes a full range of atomic spacing, which allows for greater absorption and use of sunlight. The thick, rigid germanium  layer  is removed, reducing the cell's cost and 94% of its weight. By turning the conventional approach to cells on its head, the result is an ultra-light and flexible cell that also converts solar energy with record efficiency (40.8 percent under 326  suns  concentration).     [ edit ]   Polymer processing   The invention of  conductive polymers  (for which  Alan Heeger ,  Alan G. MacDiarmid  and  Hideki Shirakawa  were awarded a  Nobel prize ) may lead to the development of  much cheaper cells  that are based on inexpensive plastics. However, all  organic solar cells  made to date suffer from degradation upon exposure to  UV  light, and hence have lifetimes which are far too short to be viable. The  conjugated  double bond systems in the polymers, which carry the charge, are always susceptible to breaking up when radiated with shorter wavelengths. Additionally, most conductive polymers, being highly unsaturated and reactive, are highly sensitive to atmospheric moisture and oxidation, making commercial applications difficult.     [ edit ]   Nanoparticle processing   Experimental non-silicon solar panels can be made of  quantum heterostructures , eg.  carbon nanotubes  or  quantum dots , embedded in  conductive polymers  or mesoporous metal oxides. In addition, thin films of many of these materials on conventional silicon solar cells can increase the optical coupling efficiency into the silicon cell, thus boosting the overall efficiency. By varying the size of the quantum dots, the cells can be tuned to absorb different wavelengths. Although the research is still in its infancy,  quantum dot -modified photovoltaics may be able to achieve up to 42 percent energy conversion efficiency due to multiple exciton generation(MEG). [ 67 ]   Researchers located at the  University of California, San Diego  have come up with a way of making solar photovoltaic cells more efficient by making them  fuzzy  with  indium phosphide   nanowires . It sounds similar to a project announced by a consortium of German universities, working in concert with  Harvard University  Science department. [ 68 ]     [ edit ]   Transparent conductors   Many new solar cells use transparent thin films that are also conductors of electrical charge. The dominant conductive thin films used in research now are transparent conductive oxides (abbreviated ""TCO""), and include fluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO 2 :F, or ""FTO""), doped  zinc oxide  (e.g.: ZnO:Al), and  indium tin oxide  (abbreviated ""ITO""). These conductive films are also used in the LCD industry for flat panel displays. The dual function of a TCO allows light to pass through a substrate window to the active light absorbing material beneath, and also serves as an ohmic contact to transport photogenerated charge carriers away from that light absorbing material. The present TCO materials are effective for research, but perhaps are not yet optimized for large-scale photovoltaic production. They require very special deposition conditions at high vacuum, they can sometimes suffer from poor mechanical strength, and most have poor transmittance in the infrared portion of the spectrum (e.g.: ITO thin films can also be used as infrared filters in airplane windows). These factors make large-scale manufacturing more costly.   A relatively new area has emerged using  carbon nanotube  networks as a transparent conductor for  organic solar cells . Nanotube networks are flexible and can be deposited on surfaces a variety of ways. With some treatment, nanotube films can be highly transparent in the infrared, possibly enabling efficient low bandgap solar cells. Nanotube networks are p-type conductors, whereas traditional transparent conductors are exclusively  n-type . The availability of a  p-type  transparent conductor could lead to new cell designs that simplify manufacturing and improve efficiency.     [ edit ]   Silicon wafer based solar cells   Despite the numerous attempts at making better solar cells by using new and exotic materials, the reality is that the photovoltaics market is still dominated by silicon wafer-based solar cells (first-generation solar cells). This means that most solar cell manufacturers are currently equipped to produce this type of solar cells. Consequently, a large body of research is being done all over the world to manufacture silicon wafer-based solar cells at lower cost and to increase the conversion efficiencies without an exorbitant increase in production cost. The ultimate goal for both wafer based and alternative photovoltaic concepts is to produce solar electricity at a cost comparable to currently marked dominating technologies like coal and nuclear power in order to make it the leading primary energy source. To achieve this it may be necessary to reduce the cost of installed solar systems from currently about US$ 1.80 (for bulk Si technologies) to about US$ 0.50 per Watt peak power. [ 69 ]  Since a major part of the final cost of a traditional bulk silicon module is related to the high cost of solar grade poly silicon feedstock (about US$ 0.4/Watt peak) there exists substantial drive to make Si solar cells thinner (material savings) or to make solar cells from cheaper upgraded metallurgical silicon (so caled ""dirty Si"").   IBM  has a semiconductor wafer reclamation process that uses a specialized pattern removal technique to repurpose scrap semiconductor wafers to a form used to manufacture silicon-based solar panels. The new process was recently awarded the 2007 Most Valuable Pollution Prevention Award from The  National Pollution Prevention Roundtable  (NPPR). [ 70 ]     [ edit ]   Infrared solar cells   Researchers at  Idaho National Laboratory , along with partners at  Microcontinuum  Inc. [ 71 ]  ( Cambridge, MA ) and Patrick Pinhero of the  University of Missouri , have devised an inexpensive way to produce plastic sheets containing billions of  nanoantennas  that collect heat energy generated by the sun and other sources, which garnered two 2007  Nano50  awards. The technology is the first step toward a solar energy collector that could be  mass-produced  on flexible materials. While methods to convert the energy into usable electricity still need to be developed, the sheets could one day be manufactured as lightweight ""skins"" that power everything from  hybrid cars  to  computers  and  iPods  with higher efficiency than traditional solar cells. The nanoantennas also have the potential to act as  cooling  devices that draw waste heat from buildings or electronics without using electricity. The nanoantennas target mid- infrared  rays, which the Earth continuously radiates as heat after absorbing energy from the sun during the day; also double-sided nanoantenna sheets can harvest energy from different parts of the sun's spectrum. In contrast, traditional solar cells can only use visible light, rendering them idle after dark. [ 72 ]   Also  Konarka  is researching  infrared  light activated photovoltaics which would enable night-time power generation.     [ edit ]   UV Solar cells   Japan's  National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology  (AIST) has succeeded in developing a  transparent  solar cell that uses  ultraviolet  light to generate electricity but allows visible light to pass through it. Most conventional solar cells use visible and infrared light to generate electricity. In contrast, the innovative new solar cell uses ultraviolet radiation. used to replace conventional window glass, the installation surface area could be large, leading to potential uses that take advantage of the combined functions of power generation, lighting and temperature control. [ 73 ]   Also  PEDOT - PSS  solar cells is a ultraviolet (UV) light selective and sensitive photovoltaic cell easily fabricated. [ 74 ]     [ edit ]   3-D solar cells   Three-dimensional solar cells that capture nearly all of the light that strikes them and could boost the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems while reducing their size, weight and mechanical complexity. The new 3D solar cells capture photons from sunlight using an array of miniature tower structures that resemble high-rise buildings in a city street grid. [ 75 ]     [ edit ]   Antireflective and all-angle coating     See also:  Anti-reflective coating     With a reflective  coating , developed at  RPI , [ 76 ]  the material absorbs 96.21 per cent of incident sunlight. This gain in absorption was consistent across the entire spectrum of sunlight, from UV to visible light and infrared. [ 77 ]   Such a method tackles the problem of absorbing sunlight evenly and equally from all angles. The seven layers, each with a height of 50-100 nm, are made up of  silicon dioxide  and  titanium dioxide   nanorods  positioned at an oblique angle. Each layer looks and functions similar to a dense forest where sunlight is ""captured"" between the trees. The nanorods were attached to a  silicon   substrate  via  chemical vapor disposition  and the new coating can be affixed to nearly any photovoltaic materials for use in solar cells, including  III-V multi-junction  and  cadmium telluride . [ 77 ]     [ edit ]   Metamaterials       Main article:  Metamaterial       Researchers at Duke University and Boston College have engineered a metamaterial that utilizes tiny geometric shapes to absorb both the electrical and magnetic properties of electromagnetic waves over a certain frequency range at a level that meets standards of scientific perfection. This results in the total absorption of light, turning it into heat, which can then create energy. [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Validation, Certification and Manufacturers   Further information:  Silicon shortage   National Renewable Energy Laboratory  tests and validates solar technologies.   There are three reliable certifications of solar equipment:  UL  and  IEEE  (both U.S. standards) and  IEC .   Solar cells are manufactured primarily in Japan, China, Germany, Taiwan and the USA, [ 79 ]  though numerous other nations have or are acquiring significant solar cell production capacity. While technologies are constantly evolving toward higher efficiencies, the most effective cells for low cost electrical production are not necessarily those with the highest efficiency, but those with a balance between low-cost production and efficiency high enough to minimize area-related balance of systems cost. Those companies with large scale manufacturing technology for coating inexpensive substrates may, in fact, ultimately be the lowest cost net electricity producers, even with cell efficiencies that are lower than those of  single-crystal  technologies.     [ edit ]   United States       Main article:  Photovoltaics in the United States       New manufacturing facilities for solar cells and modules in Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, and Texas promise to add enough capacity to produce thousands of megawatts of solar devices per year within the next few years from 2008: [ 80 ]   In late September 2008,  Sanyo  Electric Company, Ltd. announced its decision to build a manufacturing plant for solar  ingots  and  wafers  (the building blocks for silicon solar cells) in Salem, Oregon. The plant will begin operating in October 2009 and will reach its full production capacity of 70 megawatts (MW) of  solar wafers  per year by April 2010.   In early October 2008, First Solar, Inc. broke ground on an expansion of its  Perrysburg, Ohio , facility that will add enough capacity to produce another 57 MW per year of solar modules at the facility, bringing its total capacity to roughly 192 MW per year. The company expects to complete construction early next year and reach full production by mid-2010.   And in mid-October 2008,  SolarWorld  AG opened a manufacturing plant in  Hillsboro, Oregon , that is expected to produce 500 MW of solar cells per year when it reaches full production in 2011.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .

Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.

Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

For other uses, see  Fe (disambiguation) . For other uses, see  Iron (disambiguation) .   Iron  () is a   chemical element  with the symbol  Fe  (lang-la  ferrum ) and  atomic number  26. Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4   element . Iron is a lustrous, silvery soft metal. It is one of the few  ferromagnet ic elements.  Iron and nickel are the most abundant metals in metallic meteorites and in the dense-metal cores of planets such as Earth. Iron and iron  alloy s are also the most common source of  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.    Occurrence   Iron is believed to be the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon  burning in massive stars. While it makes up only about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite .  About 1 in 20  meteorite s consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (35-80% iron) and  kamacite  (90-95% iron).  Although rare,  meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the earth's surface.  The reason for Mars' red colour is thought to be an iron-oxide-rich soil.    Characteristics  Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be  modified by  alloy ing it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steel s.  Nuclei of iron have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope  62Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however, 56Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing 62Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured, and iron abundance on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production.  Iron (as Fe2+, ferrous ion) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .   Allotropes  Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal.  There are four allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.  As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1535АC into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centred cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centred cubic  (FCC) at 1401АC, when it is known as gamma-iron, or austenite. At 912АC the crystal structure again becomes BCC as beta-iron is formed, and at 770АC (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic  as alpha-iron, also known as  ferrite , which is also BCC, is formed. Thus there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in 'domain structure', where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction. However, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.  Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.  Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 АC).  Above 912АC and up to 1401АC alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146АC). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.    Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobile s, the  hull s of large  ship s, and structural components for  building s. Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect  material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level.  It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. 'White' cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation.  In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steel s contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. They are used for structural purposes, as their alloy content raises their cost and necessitates justification of their use. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxide s are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.  The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.   Paint ing,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.  Iron is believed to be the critical missing nutrient in the ocean that limits the growth of  plankton . Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing plankton growth. Larger scaled efforts are being attempted with the hope that iron seeding and ocean plankton growth can remove  carbon dioxide  from the atmosphere, thereby counteracting the  greenhouse effect  that is generally agreed by climatologists to cause  global warming . The main problem with iron fertilisation is the low photic depth of the Southern Ocean when compared with the mixing depth, resulting in phytoplankton death and reducing the NET amount of carbon dioxide taken up. The NET deposition of carbon into the ocean bed is only around 2% of the carbon taken up by the phytoplankton as carbon dioxide, as shown by research by IASOS (Institute of Antarctic & Southern Ocean Studies), AAD (Australian Antarctic Division) and ACE CRC (Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre).   Iron compounds   Iron oxides (FeO, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3) are  ore s used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ).  They are common components of terrestrial rocks.    Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C2H3O2)3 is used in the  dye ing of  cloth .    Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH4)3(C2O4)4) is used in  blueprint s.    Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO4) is used in  insecticide .     Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl3) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paint s, as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.    Iron(III) chromate (Fe2(CrO4)3) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .     Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH)3) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.     Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO4) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.     Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C2H3O2)2 is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.     Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C6H11O7)2) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pill s.    Iron(II) oxalate (FeC2O4) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastic s,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .     Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO4) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels.    Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF6)3- is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .    Historical aspects   The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors.  The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one.   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period.  During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forge s.  For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity .  New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD.  In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel.  In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel.  This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.   Production of iron from iron ore  seealso  Iron ore  The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron .  The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace .  The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.   Blast furnace   main  Blast furnace  Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ore s is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ore s, principally  haematite  (nominally Fe2O3) and  magnetite  (Fe3O4) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 АC.  In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.  In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :   2  C  +  O2   2  CO  The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:   3  CO  +  Fe2O3   2 Fe + 3  CO2  The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicate s.  Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate).  Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore.  In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):   CaCO3    CaO  +  CO2  Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .   CaO  +  SiO2    CaSiO3  The slag melts in the heat of the furnace.  In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the more dense molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately.  The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture .  In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric ton s) of iron ore was produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .   Further processes  Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it.  This is subsequently reduced to  steel  or commercially pure iron, known as  wrought iron , using other furnaces or converters.    Isotopes   Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotope s: 5.845% of radioactive 54Fe (half-life: >3.1з1022 years), 91.754% of stable 56Fe, 2.119% of stable 57Fe and 0.282% of stable 58Fe. 60Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).  Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining 60Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotope s of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge.  The isotope 56Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on 56Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both 62Ni and 58Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since 56Fe is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in nuclear reactions, it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars  and is therefore common in the universe, relative to other  metals .  In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of 60 Ni , the  daughter product  of 60Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of 60Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of 60Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide 26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroid s after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of 60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only 57Fe has a nuclear  spin  (&minus;1/2).   Iron in organic synthesis  The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compound s.  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurization s,  reduction  of  aldehyde s, and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides.    Iron in biology   main  Human iron metabolism  Iron is essential to nearly all known  organism s. In  cell s, iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloprotein s, because ""free"" iron -- which binds non-specifically to many cellular components -- can catalyse production of toxic  free radical s.   Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .  In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate   redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Storage forms of iron, like  ferritin , do not contain heme. Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur cluster s of many  enzyme s, such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrin s ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrate s) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   ester s).  The role of iron in the human body is almost exclusively in the process of respiration(utilization of oxygen).  Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammal s, partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequester ing it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells.    Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentil s,  bean s,  leaf vegetable s,  tofu ,  chickpea s,  black-eyed peas , potatoes with skin, bread made from completely whole-grain flour,  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  increases the likelihood of  colorectal cancer .  Iron provided by  dietary supplement s is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). Infants will require iron supplements if they are not breast-fed.  Blood donors  are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake.   Regulation of iron uptake  Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxide s to produce  free radical s, which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.  Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six.  The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

(Mariah Blake)                  In Germany, ruddy-cheeked farmers achieve (green) energy independence                Freiamt residents produce 17 percent more electricity than they use, boosting their bottom line and proving that green isnt just for geeky idealists.

( Correspondent Mariah Blake )                                                                                                             Freiamt, Germany                                Dawn was just breaking over the Black Forest when Helga Schneider climbed out of bed, tugged on her overalls and thick brown galoshes, and trudged out to the cow pen. She herded a dozen head into a tiled alcove strewn with straw and manure, and began fixing rubber hoses to swollen udders.   Within minutes, milk was snaking through a maze of tubes to a copper-plated box the size of a cinder block, where the warmth was siphoned off and stored for heating everything from the Schneiders bath water to their home.   Many residents of this farming village have also found creative ways to harvest energy, be it turning manure into biofuel or installing turbines in the local creek. Thanks to their ingenuity, Freiamt is not only energy independent, but produces 17 percent more power than it uses.   Its a feat that defies conventional ideas about energy  that big companies are key to a secure supply, that renewable sources can only meet a fraction of societys needs, that green energy is the domain of liberals and idealists.   Were talking about a village of traditional farmers, and yet theyre changing ideas about what is possible, says Josef Pesch, CEO of FESA, a firm that develops community renewable-energy projects. When it comes to renewables, Freiamt is a model for communities far and wide.   Last year, the village generated 14.3 million kilowatt hours of electricity, or 2.1 million more than it used. Thats enough to power 600 additional German homes. For locals, who make their living mainly from tourism and agriculture, the turn toward green energy was less about big ideals than finding new income streams that wouldnt harm the soil and forests.   Were no eco-rebels, says Mayor Hannelore Reinbold-Mench. Were simply a community making a living off the land and all it has to offer.   The idea first came in the late 1990s, when a group of investors from Hamburg started approaching farmers in Freiamt about leasing land for a wind farm.   Locals werent keen on outsiders harvesting their natural bounty. But a small group led by Ernst Leimer, who now heads the towns wind energy association, began planting wind-measuring masts at promising sites. They also started holding town hall meetings in the hopes of rallying locals to build the project themselves.   When word of the plan began filtering through the community, some residents protested, saying the windmills would blemish the landscape and hurt tourism.   But as data from the masts rolled in, people began to grasp the financial potential, and support for the project grew. Eventually, as many as 1,000 of Freiamts 4,300 residents were showing up for information sessions. When the group began soliciting funds in mid-2001, it took only eight weeks to round up the $2.3 million down payment on two 400-foot-tall windmills. All of the money came from local investors.   Lots of people know they can do something for the environment, but they dont, says Mr. Leimer. Our community took action. We did something for the environment and something for the next generation. At the same time, we did something for ourselves.   The turbines were finally built in fall 2001. The next year, they churned out enough electricity to power about 1,600 German homes. Within two years, investors were getting a 10 percent annual return  thanks to Germanys feed-in tariff law, which requires electricity-grid operators to buy renewable energy at a premium rate. The idea is to foster small-scale production of green energy.   By 2003, Leimers group was laying plans for a third wind turbine and eight photovoltaic solar-power generators. But when they started hunting for roof space to lease for solar panels, something curious happened. People said, Its my roof. Why should I lease it to someone else rather than build my own solar-power system? recalls Ms. Reinbold-Mench.   Before long, solar panels began cropping up on crumbling barns and old farmhouses all over town. Some residents also started venturing into other technologies.   Today, Freiamt has four windmills, around 250 rooftop solar systems generating heat and electricity, and a handful of biogas digesters, which turn animal dung and other organic waste into fuel. Several residents have also ripped out ancient water wheels and installed modern hydro generators.   The Mellert bakery and gristmill, with its four stories of whirring machines and baking ovens, is powered by a water turbine. So is the rustic saw mill owned by Gottlieb Reinbold, a white-haired former pig farmer in patched overalls. During peak season, the turbine produces enough electricity to power both the mill and his home. It also feeds enough power into the grid to earn him $880 a month, about half his total income.   Its not a lot of money, he says. But it helps to keep me afloat.   Others villagers harvest energy from a mix of sources. The Schneider family supplements the heat they generate from cow milk with a zero-emission wood-chip boiler they installed between the racks of dusty mason jars in their basement. Its fueled by leftover scraps from wood they harvest in a backyard patch of forest.   The family has also sunk more than $15,000 into the community windmill project and installed a billboard-size array of photovoltaic solar panels on the roof over the scalloped wood balconies of their farmhouse. The investment has paid off. The panels alone produce about 30,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year  50 percent more energy than the Schneiders use. By feeding this into the grid, they earn roughly $24,000 annually.   The money helps fill the gap left by low wholesale milk prices and allows them to save for retirement. We have to look toward the future, says Mrs. Schneider. My mother spent her whole life working the land, and she cant live off her pension.   The surge of renewable energy has also been a boon to Freiamts growing tourism industry. Many of the 42,000-plus visitors to the town each year are ecotourists, some from as far away as India and South Korea. Even some residents who initially opposed the project, are now leading hiking tours to the turbines  just one sign of the changes that have swept the village.   People used to laugh at us, says Reinbold-Mench They thought of us as simple country folk. Now theyre coming from all over just to see what were doing, and thats a huge source of pride for little Freiamt.                (  More stories  )                             Comments                             1.               Paul Gipe  | 08.21.08         Excellent piece Mariah. You hit the nail on the head. 1,000 local investors now own their own wind power plant–it’s theirs earning revenue for them and their community.   Thanks.                                       2.              Meryl Steinberg  | 08.21.08         Just shouted this to @earth911 on twitter. Great idea. Although wondering what is going to happen to our dear birds.                                             3.              Curious  | 08.22.08         “The panels alone produce about 30,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year  50 percent more energy than the Schneiders use. By feeding this into the grid, they earn roughly $24,000 annually.”   Just how expensive is energy in Germany?  If they produce 50% more energy than than use, that implies they are dumping 10k kW-h onto the net, at a price of $2.40 per kW-h.  That’s ten times what I’m paying (USA).  Our energy costs might be cheaper than Germany, but 10x cheaper?                                       4.              Eric Chaffee  | 08.22.08         Mariah,   I’m a big fan of alternative energy, having erected my own small windmill on my farm here near Buffalo NY. Now our town is considering a very restrictive ordinance. I’m concerned we may effectively “outlaw” resources from being developed.    Your article had no interviews with people who might have been negatively impacted by the projects. I wish you had endeavored to speak with those who might feel the windmills are too loud.  Were there no comments from those who wish the windmills had never been built?   ~eric.                                       5.              Lee  | 08.22.08         Meryl, the wind turbines that are going up on the “Wind Mill Farms” and the one pictured in this German town seldom rotate fast enough to hurt our birds. They are not like the old ‘Wind Mills’ we use to use (and there are still some in use)  Lee                                                   6.              Proloy Bagchi  | 08.23.08         I am impressed. I have always been a fan of German ingenuity. In my small way i am going to propagate it in India  Thanks, anyway, for the enlightening piece                                       7.              David  | 08.23.08         Very inspiring.  Could this be the start of the monopolistic utility model being broken down by the local initiative of free progressively minded citizens?  Were we really expecting thought-provoking leadership in alternative energy to come from utility companies anyway???                                       8.              Allison O.  | 08.25.08         Inspiring article! It is wonderful to know that this type of living is possible and that such creative ways of harnessing renewable resources have been used. I’m interested to know if there are farming communities like this in the US.                                             9.              Thomas  | 08.26.08         IN Germany I believe the the Feed-in tariff pays about 45 Euro Cents per Kilowatt of Photovoltaic power. Each Renewable Energy source has different rates of support(Wind,Geo-thermal,Wave,Ocean Current,Bio-fuels,organic farming,Eco-friendly material production,etc).  The average German pay about 20 Euro Cents per Kilowatt of Electricity and the average Electrical/heating bill per month is less then $100 dollars.  It depends on the time of the year, in the winter it will be more because of heating but in the summer many Bills are no more then $50.00 a month.  Germany is about 60% more energy efficient compared to the USA, their cars get much higher Gas Mileage(The VW Diesal Polo gets over 60MPG), factories use less energy, Mining industries use less energy,Households use less enery some of it is conservation and alot is do to the fact Germany uses much more energy efficient machinery. The Enviromental Industry in Germany Employs over 1 Million people and is growing rapidly while the Renewable Energy INdustry Employs over 300,000 alone and also grows rapidly.  Germany is the world’s Largest Exporting Nation and one of the largest Creditor Nations which is a true measure of economic power.  The Germany Government/INdustry an on dominating a large portion of the Environmental/Renewable Energy Industry by 2020.  Many of the Environmental/Renewable Energy Projects in the USA are being built by European Companies. The Wind Energy Industry in the USA is 60% controlled by European Companies for example. Same Goes with most of the En vironmental field. THe Eurozone is a much bigger Manufacturing Power then the USA and Exports almost 3 Trillion dollars worth of Goods and Services Yearly which is seldom Mentioned in the press.  Efficiency is a key reason why the Europeans are so Successful whether it be Educational Training, Great Logistical Assets,Efficient and less costly Healthcare System, A huge Renewable/Environmental Industry to help with Economic Efficiency and the Environment,also they do not use their Military for Resource WARS.  We here in America have been screwed for the past 30 years or so since the late 1970’s and now are only waking up to this fact.  Whether it be the 8 Million people in the Correctional Institutions, The costliest Higher Education system in the World, A weak Vocational/Technical Training System, Infrustructure that is falling apart,A weak manufacturing base along with huge trade deficits,Weak Healthcare system(ranked 37th in the World),Weak Environmental Standards(second most polluting Nation on the planet behing CHina)and is that why the average American Life Longevity Compared to other nations is only 45 and Falling?  This New Environmental Revolution could Renew America but we all must get behind it.                                       10.              Thomas  | 08.26.08         On the above Longevity the average American Lifespan compared to other Nations is ranked 45th in the world.                                       11.               Will Riley  | 08.28.08         Wonderful article, but I was wondering if these alternative energy plans could be adopted where I live in Atlanta, Georgia.  Can Atlanta or any of its surrounding cities adopt Freiamt’s wind-based energy strategy?  If so, how do local residents organize it?

[ 1 ]  Its construction involves two stages, with the first one being constructed in 13 months and completed in 2008, and the other will be completed by 2010, at a total cost of 250 million for the project. [ 2 ]   The power station will have an installed capacity of 62 MWp, counting a total of over 376,000  solar panels [ 3 ]  Almost 190,000 panels (32 MW) are fitted on fixed structures, 52,000 (10 MW) on  single-axis trackers , which follow the sun across the sky, and a further 20 MW of power capacity will be added during phase two of the project. [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  It will occupy an area of 320 acres (130  hectares ), producing 88 GWh of electrical energy per year (10 MW average - equivalent to the electricity consumption of 15,000 Europeans). [ 3 ]   A 7.6 million solar panel factory, located in Moura, was constructed by  Acciona , which will provide panels for the second stage of the station construction. Its future production will be targeted at the international market, with a capacity of producing 24 MW of solar panels annually.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .

Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .

Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

Solar Panel information and facts                          home  | solar house  | |  Designing Solar System                   A solar panel simply put is a collection of solar cells. They work together         to supply electricity for various uses. A single cell does not have the         capacity for generating a lot of electricity so multiple cells are connected         together to increase the capacity, how many cells depends on the amount         of electricity required. The more light available to the solar panels the         greater the amount of electricity they can supply.        Solar panels are designed to convert light into electricity. The process         of extracting electricity from light is called Photovoltaic (PV) and the         PV process converts solar energy directly into electricity.        A PV cell, also known as a self-generating barrier layer cell is a PV detector         that converts radiant flux straight into electrical current. It consists         of a thin silver film on a semiconductor layer deposited on an iron substrate.               The development of solar energy dates back more than 100 years, to the         middle of the industrial revolution. There were a number of groundbreaking         solar power plants constructed to produce steam from the heat of the sun,         which was used to drive the machinery. At the same time, Henri Becquerel         discovered the photovoltaic effect that is the production of electricity         directly from the sun. Becquerel's research was investigated and extended         by several sientists among them was Werner Siemens. Photovoltaic power remained         a novelty for many years, since it was very inefficient at turning sunlight         into electricity.        This technology is used in spacecraft by NASSA as it's simplicity provides         stability because it has no moving parts and does not require refueling         so they are reliable, long-lasting and do not require regular maintenance.         The solar panels are usually designed to so that the cells face the sun         at all times to maximise the benefit of the light available.         There are no harmful emissions from PV equipment and its operations are         virtually noise free, which makes it environmentally superior to alternative         forms of generating electricity.        The practical use of solar power for remote homes is gaining momentum.         In the past people who wanted to live in remote areas had to pay a high         price for power to be connected to their houses but with solar technology         they be virtually self-sufficient and as a bonus they have no worries about         blackouts. Most home appliances run on alternating current (AC) but with         an inverter, which converts direct current (DC) power from the solar cells         to alternating current (AC), a solar home can operate very much like a home         connected to a power line. Even a phone box in the middle of nowhere can         be powered by solar power from solar panels eliminating the need for underground         cables.        RV systems can now be used to power a wide variety of our every day requirements        from watches to hot water. The development of a commercial vehicle that        can, at least in part, derive its power from the sun will solve a lot of        problems such as pollution emissions from the burning of fossil fuel and        the cost of using a finite resource will be greatly reduced. The more solar        power we use the greater the relief on current powering systems and can        help avoid creating more nuclear reactors that create horrific pollution        problem with what to do with contaminated waste.        Ongoing research has yielded different and ever more efficient and versatile        forms of the semiconductor wafers, such as gallium arsenide, that go to        form solar cells. There are now variations that can be used in partial shade        without a great loss of efficiency and forms that are more tolerant of high        temperatures enabling their use in remote desert locations. Lightweight        portable PV panels are now available that can be used to power communications        equipment or recharge batteries in expedition environments. There are also        panels with a high degree of structural integrity and these can be incorporated        as part of roof fabric rather than as later additions to a structure.       Once in place, they are low-maintenance - making them ideal for remote        or inaccessible locations, silent and in many cases, unobtrusive; the best        place for a solar panel is in direct sunlight, away from any obstructions,        and this is often out of sight on rooftops.        Until recently, generating electricity from sunlight has often been prohibitively        expensive and its domestic application has usually been seen as the preserve        of either the wealthy or seriously committed environmentalist. Increases        in the efficiency of PV cells combined with greater governmental awareness,        especially in Europe and Japan, of the merits of alternative and renewable        energy sources, have lead to bold initiatives such as grants and subsidies        being taken to encourage PV panel usage.        Spain for instance is now insisting that from 2005, all new buildings and        renovations must incorporate solar energy gathering equipment into their        designs. Similar initiatives will eventually help to drive down costs and        bring solar panels and more environmentally friendly power generation within        easier reach of the average pocket.

Pall leads the world in filtration, separation and purification and these innovations are expect to increase efficiency of processes and reduce environmental impact. The company will display the new technologies in San Francisco at SEMICON West between July 15 and 17.    The first new technology to be used by Pall Corporation is the resource recovery system, which will help solar silicon (which is vital for the production of photovoltaic panels) manufacturers in two significant ways. The resource recovery system separates the spin-off silicon particles produced during the manufacture of silicon wafers, which are cut from silicon logs formed by de-ionized (DI), extra-pure water. This separated silicon is reused, thus saving resources. The other way this technology will help is by recovering up to 95% DI water, which is quite expensive. De-ionized water is an important part of the manufacture of semiconductors and solar cells, and its conservation cuts costs and also reduces effluents. Thus this resource recovery system recovers both raw material and water used in the process of solar silicon production.   ...  read more..

In an effort to increase its renewable energy resources, General Motors has recently made it known that the biggest rooftop solar photovoltaic power installation will be set up on its Zaragoza automobile assembly plant.    This plant, in Figueruelas, Zaragoza, Spain, will have approximately 85,000 solar panels, covering a rooftop area of around 2,000,000 square feet. General Motors estimates that the set up will be complete by the autumn of this year, and will generate something like 15.1 million kWh of power a year. Thats about how much 4,575 Spanish homes with an average yearly consumption of 3,300 kWh will use.   Glad to take the lead in using renewable energy, the Group Vice President of Global Manufacturing and Labor Relations, General Motors, Gary Cowger said, ""The Zaragoza project demonstrates proof that GM is actively accelerating our efforts to be part of the solution to the environmental issues and challenges facing our world.

Imagine a time when nearly every household, apartment complex, town home and condo would be covered with photovoltaic cells.    Well actually you dont have to imagine too far in the future for all of this. There has been a phenomenal growth in interest and investment of solar energy. The solar industry has gotten a new lease of life with the resurgence and newfound enthusiasm in solar energy from projects like San Franciscos huge new grant program to a new 280 MW plant in Arizonas desert.  Joining the bandwagon is one of the most successful manufacturers of consumer microprocessors, Intel.    To get solar power going in a big way, Intel is establishing a solar startup unit in order to gather investments required for it to become one of the forerunners in this field.

Norris Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park       Time  magazine is reporting this week a story entitled “A Spurt of Quake Activity  Raises Fears in Yellowstone.”  The park’s thermal features including hot  springs, mud pots, fumaroles and geysers create an atmosphere that would make  anyone wonder about the possibility of another “supervolcano” like the one that  exploded 642,000 years ago.  Geologists believe that such an explosion would be  “1,000 times more powerful than the explosion of Mount St. Helens in 1980” and  “not only cover most of the U.S. with ash but also throw so much dust into the  atmosphere that the world's climate could change”.  (See the January 1, 2009 issue of   Time ).       Is North America and beyond threatened by a imminent eruption  of a Yellowstone supervolcano?  To understand the situation more the  National Park Service has posted the following information on the situation on  the park’s website:                 Volcano Questions & Answers             Q: How imminent is an eruption of the Yellowstone Volcano?     A:  There is no evidence that a catastrophic  eruption at Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is imminent. Current geologic  activity at Yellowstone has remained relatively constant since earth scientists  first started monitoring some 30 years ago. Though another caldera-forming  eruption is theoretically possible, it is very unlikely to occur in the next  thousand or even 10,000 years. Scientists have also found no indication of an  imminent smaller eruption of lava.       Q: How much advance notice would there be of an eruption?   A:  The  science of forecasting a volcanic eruption has significantly advanced over the  past 25 years. Most scientists think that the buildup preceding a catastrophic  eruption would be detectable for weeks and perhaps months to years. Precursors  to volcanic eruptions include strong earthquake swarms and rapid ground  deformation and typically take place days to weeks before an actual eruption.  Scientists at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory* (YVO) closely monitor the  Yellowstone region for such precursors. They expect that the buildup to larger  eruptions would include intense precursory activity (far exceeding background  levels) at multiple spots within the Yellowstone volcano. As at many caldera  systems around the world, small earthquakes, ground uplift and subsidence, and  gas releases at Yellowstone are commonplace events and do not reflect impending  eruptions.    *The YVO is a collaborative effort between the US Geological Survey, the  University of Utah, and YNP to monitor and study the Yellowstone Volcano.  Congress has given the USGS the responsibility of volcano hazard assessment, and  YNP assists the USGS in their volcano monitoring effort.       Q: In regard to volcanic activity, is it  safe to visit Yellowstone?     A:  Yes.  Scientists do not have any indication of an imminent eruption, or any eruption,  at this time.     Q: What is park staff doing to monitor and  assess the probability of an eruption?   A:   The YVO maintains an array of instruments that monitor activities at Yellowstone  around the clock. In addition, YVO scientists collaborate with scientists from  all over the world to study and assess the hazards of the Yellowstone volcano.  To learn more about Yellowstone's volcanic past and to view current data about  earthquakes, ground movement, and stream flow, visit the YVO website at      http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/ .       Q: When will the volcano erupt again? Will  there be any warning? How much warning will there be?   A:  The  science of forecasting a volcanic eruption has significantly advanced over the  past 25 years. Most scientists think that the buildup preceding a catastrophic  eruption would be detectable for weeks and perhaps months to years. Precursors  to volcanic eruptions include strong earthquake swarms and rapid ground  deformation and typically take place days to weeks before an actual eruption.  Scientists at the YVO closely monitor the Yellowstone region for such  precursors. They expect that the buildup to larger eruptions would include  intense precursory activity (far exceeding background levels) at multiple spots  within the Yellowstone volcano. As at many caldera systems around the world,  small earthquakes, ground uplift and subsidence, and gas releases at Yellowstone  are commonplace events and do not reflect impending eruptions.       Q: Is the volcano dormant or extinct or still  active?   A:  The  Yellowstone Volcano is still active. Evidence for the activity of the  Yellowstone Volcano are the 1,000 to 3,000 earthquakes per year, active ground  deformation, and the over 10,000 thermal features found in Yellowstone.         Q: What is Yellowstone doing to prevent an  eruption?   A:   Nothing can be done to prevent an eruption. The temperatures, pressures,  physical characteristics of partially molten rock, and the immensity of the  magma chamber are beyond man's ability to influence--much less control.         Q: How will the park get the word out if there  is an eruption?   A:  The  park would communicate accurate and timely information to park visitors, park  employees, concessioners, surrounding communities, media outlets, and other  interested parties through the park's 24-hour Communications Center; news  releases; established emergency response programs; and through notification of  appropriate interagency, state and local government agencies.         Q: Where would it be safe to be during an  eruption?   A:   For the most likely type of volcanic eruption in Yellowstone, everywhere would  be safe except in the immediate vicinity of the advancing lava flow. In the  highly improbable event of a large catastrophic eruption, the greater the  distance from the eruptive center, the safer it would be. It is impossible to  know the effects of the eruption without guessing at the explosivity of the  highly unlikely eruption and the total amount of the material erupted.       Q: Would the public know about a possible  eruption?   A:   Yes. Scientists continuously monitor volcano activity in Yellowstone and share  that information through news releases, web sites, etc. Current  real-time-monitoring data are online at      http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/monitoring.html.                                                                       El Paso, TX  Park News            The Year of Environmental Challenge Makes Way for a Year   of Opportunity           United Nations Environmental Program              The Year of Living Dangerously          Financial damage and loss of life caused by climate-related natural    disasters made 2008 one of the most devastating years on record.         Cyclone Nargis last June claimed 78,000 lives in    Myanmar. The Atlantic hurricane season caused devastation in the    Caribbean, Central America and the United States.        Costs associated with weather-related catastrophes are estimated by    Munich Re - the world's biggest reinsurer and UNEP Finance Initiative    partner - at about $200bn in 2008, double the losses incurred in 2007.    Insured losses of $45bn were 50 per cent more than in the previous year.    Hurricane Ike cost insurers $15bn in the United States.         Climate extremes, including devastating floods, severe droughts, snow    storms, heat waves and cold waves marked the year. Ice volume in the    Arctic dropped to its second-lowest level.         Earlier in the year, Achim Steiner, UNEP Executive Director said, ""The    extreme weather events we are witnessing underline the increasing    vulnerability of humankind to natural disasters ? vulnerability that    scientists predict will rise if climate change is left unchecked.""         A Climate for Change          The UN climate convention meeting, due to convene in Copenhagen in    December 2009, is an opportunity to respond to the climate challenge    with decisive, legally-binding commitments.         The world will need to take action towards reducing greenhouse emissions    and to provide funding mechanisms to climate-proof vulnerable economies    and communities.         The Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) allows developed    countries to offset some of their emissions by funding projects in    developing countries. The Mechanism is emerging as a key instrument for    combating climate change and a creative stimulus package to developing    country economies.         Thousands of projects joined the CDM in 2008. It is estimated the number    of CDM projects will rise from 4,200 to 8,000 by 2012, generating    financial flows from North to South of well over $30 billion.         It is widely agreed the mechanism needs to be made more robust in order    for it to perform on the scale needed.         Seeing REDD          Up to 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions result from deforestation.    But forests have, so far, made an insignificant contribution to CDM    projects with only 0.7% registered for afforestation and reforestation.           To unleash the enormous economic, environmental and social potential of    forests, the UN launched, in September 2008, the UN Reduced Emissions    from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) programme, which aims    at tipping the economic balance in favour of the sustainable management    of forests.         If REDD gets the green light in a post-2012 UN climate agreement it may    eventually lead to developed countries being able to pay developing ones    for the emissions saved from improved management of in particular    tropical forests. Such an arrangement could be crucial in the global    effort to avoid catastrophic climate change, but it must come in concert    with the will to make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.         The project is implemented by the Food and Agricultural Organization    (FAO); the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UNEP, in the spirit of    the UN 'Delivering as One'.         A report by UNEP's Finance Initiative indicates that public-private    insurance solutions may well be needed to kick start the forest carbon    market and the potential of reduced emissions.        Business Un-usual          Global markets are still trying to cope with the aftermath of the credit    crunch, the single catastrophe for which 2008 will be remembered for    generations to come.         To face up to the challenges of economic meltdown and global warming,    the UN called in 2008 for a Global Green New Deal: a UN-led initiative    that seeks to mobilize and refocus the global economy towards investment    in clean technologies, renewable energy and natural infrastructure to    combat climate change and trigger a green employment boom.         The Green New Deal and the Green Economy Initiative signal a new chapter    in UNEP's efforts to strengthen work on the interface between    environment and economy. They may also provide sustainable solutions to    benefit both the economy and the environment in the 21st century and    beyond.         Energizing Renewables          Innovation and greening of the global economy are emerging on    several fronts, including a multi-billion dollar boom in renewable    energy development and the growing carbon markets.         Over $148 billion in new funding entered the sustainable energy sector    globally last year, up 60 percent from 2006, even as a credit crunch    began to roil financial markets.         Geothermal electricity potential in Africa is estimated at 7,000 Mega    Watts, much of it in the part of the Rift Valley that runs from Kenya to    Djibouti. With funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), UNEP    and the World Bank launched the African Rift Geothermal Facility (ARGeo).    The $18 million project is underwriting the risks of drilling for steam    and in doing so building the confidence of the private sector to build    geothermal power stations.         Estimates indicate that globally, geothermal capacity rose from 1,300MW    in 1975 to close to 8,000MW in 2000 and stood at almost 10,000MW in    2007. By 2010, geothermal capacity could reach 13,500MW.         UNEP and the GEF's Solar and Wind Resource Assessment have 'found' 10    million MW of solar and wind energy in 26 developing countries available    for private sector development.         With $20 million in GEF and UN Foundation support, UNEP is also working    with the Asian and African Development Banks to leverage private sector    financial flows towards clean energy entrepreneurs. Over 50    entrepreneurial businesses specializing in clean energy technologies and    services have been financed to date in Africa, Brazil and China.         The sustainability of biofuels has assumed global significance given, on    the one hand, the potential of biofuels to contribute to GHG emission    reduction and climate change mitigation, and on the other, the concerns    raised in 2008 about biofuel production's impact on the global food    crisis.      UNEP is leading the effort to develop standards on    the development of the biofuel economy. The Roundtable on Sustainable    Biofuels (RSB) has produced draft principles and criteria, currently    open to a 6-month public comment period.         A Global Renewable Energy Insurance Facility, expected to be launched by    UNEP and partners in 2009, will bring a wide range of innovative    insurance and risk management products to assist the growth of    renewables and clean energy in developing economies.         Investment in sustainable energy between now and 2030 is expected to    reach $450 billion a year by 2012, rising to more than $600 billion a    year from 2020.         Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that fossil fuels remain the most    heavily subsidized worldwide. Total energy subsidies amount to around    USD 300.000 billion per year, or around 0.7 per cent of GDP. In a report    entitled ""Reforming Energy Subsidies - Opportunities to Contribute to    the Climate Change Agenda"", UNEP maintained that subsidies can be    beneficial if used for enhancing access to sustainable energy and    promoting clean energy technologies. The report argued against subsidies    that lead to unhealthy patterns of energy production and use,                                                   To Top of Page             Home  |  top                                                         "

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidizes readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes   Main article:  Allotropes of iron   Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallizes at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy          The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore   See also:  Iron ore          Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace   Main article:  Blast furnace          Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes   Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks   Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content, the higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes   Main article:  Isotopes of iron   Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b       Main article:  Human iron metabolism   Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption, high blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

What drives the              plates?               Study of the motions of plates              is called kinematics, while study of the driving forces is called              dynamics.  ""A key to the simplicity of plate tectonics is that              the strength of lithospheric plates enables the analysis of their              kinematics to be isolated and treated separately from the dynamic              processes controlling plate motions; relative velocities of plates              can be analysed without reference to the forces that give rise to              them"" 28 .               Around the end of the first decade of dominance              by plate tectonics, in 1975, the situation was described this              way: ""In recent years, the kinematics of continental drift              and sea-floor spreading have been successfully described by the              theory of plate tectonics.  However, rather little is known              about the driving mechanisms of plate tectonics, although various              types of forces have been suggested"" 12 .  Seven              years later, in 1982, the assessment was: ""At the present time              the geometry of plate movements is largely understood, but the              driving mechanism of plate tectonics remains elusive"" 1 . By 1995 we find that: ""In spite of all              the mysteries this picture of moving tectonic plates has solved,              it has a central, unsolved mystery of its own: What drives the              plates in the first place? '[That] has got to be one of the more              fundamental problems in plate tectonics,' notes geodynamicist Richard              O'Connell of Harvard University.  'It's interesting it has              stayed around so long' "" 20 .  In 2002              it could be said that: ""Although the concept of plates moving              on Earth's surface is universally accepted, it is less clear              which forces cause that motion.  Understanding the mechanism              of plate tectonics is one of the most important problems in the              geosciences"" 6 .  A 2004 paper noted that ""considerable              debate remains about the driving forces of the tectonic plates and              their relative contribution"" 33 .  ""Alfred Wegener's theory              of continental drift died in 1926, primarily because no one could              suggest an acceptable driving mechanism.  In an ironical              twist, continental drift (now generalized to plate tectonics) is              almost universally accepted, but we still do not understand the              driving mechanism in anything other than the most general terms"" 2 .               The problem has always been that it is hard to              discern what is going on deep in the Earth, motion is almost              imperceptably slow, and different combinations of forces, perhaps              varying over time, could apply to particular areas.  ""When              the concepts of convection and plate tectonics were first developing,              many thought of mantle convection as a process heated from below,              which in turn exerts driving tractions on the base of a relatively              stagnant 'crust' (later, 'lithosphere') to cause continental drift.               In the early  1970s, more sophisticated understanding of              convection led to the opposite view.  It was realized that              only              a fraction of the Earth's heat flow originates in the core, while              most results from radioactivity and/or secular cooling of the              mantle.  Computer models showed that internally heated (and/or              surface cooled) systems have no upwelling sheets or plumes and              that all concentrated flow originates in the upper cold boundary              layer, which stirs the interior as it sinks.  Thus it became              natural to regard plates of lithosphere as driving themselves              and, incidentally, stirring the rest of the mantle"" 3 .  Some researchers make the point emphatically: ""convection              does not drive plates.""  Upper mantle convection is a              product, not a cause, of plate motions 16 .  Thus the              location and orientation of a sinking slab is the              best indicator of which way upper mantle flows.               ""The advent of plate tectonics made the classical              mantle convection hypothesis even more untenable.  For instance,              the supposition that mid-oceanic ridges are the site of upwelling              and trenches are that of sinking of the large scale convective              flow cannot be valid, because it is now established that actively              spreading,              oceanic ridges migrate and often collide with trenches"" 12 .  ""Another difficulty is that if this is currently              the main mechanism, the major convection cells would have to have              about half  the width of the large oceans, with a pattern              of motion that would have to be more or less constant over very              large areas under the lithosphere.  This would fail to explain              the relative motion of plates with irregularly shaped margins              at the Mid-Atlantic ridge and Carlsberg ridge, and the motion of              small              plates, such as the Caribbean and the Philippine plates"" 15 .

The stress required for crustal shortening to              build mountains has been              calculated to be in a range from 1500 to 2500 bars 10               up to  4000 to 6000 bars 31 , inferring the latter              ""from earthquake data and evaluation of the stresses required              to produce specific geological structures"".  In the case              of South America, the combination of ridge push and forward              basal drag (by trench suction) could produce only 400 to 600 bars of force, which              is clearly insufficient to  build the Andes.  These forces are already              engaged in moving  the              entire plate westward !   A researcher who acknowledged this              failure  was moved to suggest another mechanism (gravity glide)              that              had been discarded many years ago 31  (and              is still out of favor).  At present, plate              tectonics is too weak to provide  the force needed to build the              Andes of South America.

Like South America,             there is no subducting slab attached to the North American plate              to pull on it.  The Farallon plate/slab is an eastward extension              of the Pacific plate, and now is mostly beneath North              America.  It is unusual because of the very shallow descent              angle attributed to it.  In a study of best-fit models, researchers              found that the Farallon slab, which extends from the west coast              of North America to the east under the continent, dropped passively              and was overridden about 1500 km by the North American plate.  This              indicates ""that beneath North America no major drift of              the lower mantle has occurred."" 17               Farallon              plate remnants in cutaway                 ""Our modelling              suggests that North America is strongly coupled to Earth's interior              only at the cratonic root [in the large Canadian Shield around and              under Hudson Bay], and the NE direction of root drag implies that              mantle beneath North America moves at a relatively low speed compared              to the SW motion of North America.""  For the best-fit              models, cratonic root basal traction is 40-50 bar going NE-NNE,              affecting about 5% of the North American plate area.  This              ""tends to counteract ridge push.""  ""Ridge push              is the single most important load acting on the North American plate."" 17                             Another study estimates              the ridge-push force on North America at about 200 bars, and that              the total basal forces ""are of the same order as ridge push.""               They believe the basal force is driving the plate forward, not              resisting. 4                While the direction of basal flow has long been disputed,               5,6,23,35  even              the best-case scenario (200 bars ridge push + 200 bars basal drive              = 400 bars) is obviously inadequate to raise the vast mountain              ranges of western North America.

The formation of both mountain              ranges and crustal roots creates gravitational potential energy.               Moreover, part of this energy increases as the square of the              mean elevation, or of the excess thickness of crust in the root.               Consequently, as mountain ranges and high plateaus are elevated              and the crust is thickened, an increasingly larger amount of work              must be done for each subsequent increment of uplift."" 30               ""Because of the increasing              amount of work that must be done against gravity acting on an increasingly              higher [mountain] range, the range should reach a maximum mean elevation              related to the force at which the plates are pushed together.  In              this sense, the mean elevations of high plateaus serve as crude              pressure gauges for the average compressive stresses pushing on              the margins of the plateaus.  When the maximum elevations are              reached, crustal shortening need not cease; convergence can continue              as the range builds outward, growing laterally into a high plateau."" 30               These investigators calculate the              required horizontal force to maintain the current elevations to              be 690 bars x 100 km depth for Tibet, and 520 bars x 100 km depth              for the Andes.  ""By writing in these units of bars x kilometers,              we can visualize these forces per unit length as average horizontal              compressive stresses applied to layers of a given thickness.  Clearly,              changing the value of this thickness requires a proportional change              in the average horizontal stress."" 30                So confining the stress to the crust, as seems appropriate,              changes the force to 1725 bars x 40 km depth for Tibet, and 1300              bars x 40 km depth for the Andes.  Using this same estimate,              another researcher determined that the ""force needed to support              Tibet"" is ""equivalent to average deviatoric stresses of              ~120 MPa [1200 bars] if contained within the 40 km elastic layer"". 24               In 1982, several investigators              contemplated the force needed to hold up the Himalayas, using atmospheres              (atm) as a measure of pressure.  An atm and a bar are almost              equivalent.  ""We considered a model in which the only              driving forces are the pulling force of a subducting plate and the              pushing force of an oceanic ridge.  In that model the stress...              operating in a collision boundary was estimated being of the order              of 100 atm.  However, the Himalayas cannot be held up by such              a small stress.""  The calculated ""a value of over              600 atm"".  ""Note, however, that this estimate of              600 atm represents the minimum necessary amount to hold up the Himalayas              and Tibet, and is derived by considering these as if they were a              tank of water.  Thus, within an actual solid body there will              probably be much larger stresses."" 27               As the above examples illustrate,              the force needed to deform the crust and raise the Himalayas far              exceed the capability of plate tectonics mechanisms.               Slab pull                The slab pull force deserves special consideration because it is central to  plate tectonics theory.  Here are excerpts from a 50 page review of slab pull and  subduction.               ""Most of the literature indicates that the slab pull is  about 3.3 x 10 13  N/m.               This is a force per unit-length parallel to the  trench."" 9   It is probably not enough force to compress lithosphere and raise  mountains. 9               [paraphrased from original text, p. 156]               ""The subduction process is more a passive feature rather than  being a driving mechanism of plate motions.""  Most dipping slabs are  being compressed at depths typically shallower than 300 km, indicating slabs  forced to sink rather than falling away. 9               ""Some plates... move without              any slab pulling them, for example the westward movements of North              America, Africa, and South America.  Trench suction has been              proposed to explain these movements, but beneath both North and              South America the mantle is moving relatively eastward, opposite              to the kinematics required by the trench suction model.""  ""The              African plate moves westward without any slab in its western side.               Moreover, it moves opposite to a hypothetical Atlantic ridge              push."" 9               ""The energy required to pull the  plates is far higher than the strength that plates can withstand under  extension.""  The subducted slab is likely able to sustain the load induced  by slab pull, but this load probably cannot be transmitted to the rest of  the plate without breaking it apart. 9               ""The slab pull concept is based on the hypothesis of a  homogeneous composition of the upper mantle, with the lithosphere sinking  only because it is cooler.  However, the oceanic lithosphere is frozen  shallow asthenosphere, previously depleted beneath a mid-oceanic ridge.  Depleted asthenosphere is lighter than the 'normal' deeper undepleted  asthenosphere.  Therefore the assumption that the lithosphere is heavier only  because it is cooler might not be entirely true, and the slab pull could be  overestimated."" 9               ""Within a slab, eclogitization [(transforming to eclogite  under increased pressure and temperature)] is assumed to make the  lithosphere denser. However, eclogitization is concentrated in the 6-8 km  thick oceanic crust, whereas the remaining 60-80 km-thick lithospheric  mantle does not undergo the same transformation. Therefore only 1/10 of the  slab is apparently increasing in density, but the main mass of the slab  (90%) does not change significantly.""  ""Nevertheless, this type of  metamorphic transition is often assumed to be able to determine the slab  pull.""  The small density contrast between subducting crust and mantle  casts doubt on the effectiveness of slab pull. 9                             Tomographic images of  earth's interior are often used to show subduction.  However, ""low velocity  volumes of the mantle detected by tomography can be due to lateral  variations in composition rather than in temperature, i.e., they can be even  higher density areas rather than hotter, lighter buoyant material as so far  interpreted.""  ""As extreme examples, gold or lead have high density but  low seismic velocity.  Therefore the interpretation of tomographic images of  the mantle where the red (lower velocity) areas are assumed as lighter and  hotter rocks can simply be wrong, i.e., they may even be cooler and denser.   With the same reasoning, blue (higher velocity) areas, which are assumed as  denser and cooler rocks may even be warmer and lighter.""  Sometimes  pieces are assumed to have detached from slabs and fallen away, and appear  as blobs on tomographic images.  ""Tomographic images are based on velocity  models that often overestimate the velocity of the asthenosphere where  usually the detachment is modeled. Therefore the detachment disappears when  using slower velocity for the asthenosphere in the reference velocity model,  or when generating regional tomographic images with better accuracy."" 9               ""If  oceanic lithosphere is heavier than the underlying mantle, why are there no  blobs of lithospheric mantle falling in the upper mantle below the western,  older side of the Pacific plate?""  Slab dip has been thought to be  related to its age, as in ""the western Pacific subduction zones because the  subducting western Pacific oceanic lithosphere is older, cooler and  therefore denser. However, the real dip of the slabs worldwide down to  depths of 250 km shows no relation with the age of the downgoing  lithosphere."" 9               ""There is an observed net  westward drift of the lithosphere, with respect to the hotspot reference  frame, of 5 to 9 cm per year."" 33   This can also be thought of as eastward drift  of the mantle.  We are supposed to believe that  ""the 700 km-long West Pacific slab... should pull and carry the 10,000              km-wide Pacific plate, 33 times bigger, overcoming the shear              resistance at the plate base and the opposing basal drag induced              by the relative eastward mantle flow."" 9               ""The negative  buoyancy [(dense enough to sink)] of slabs should determine the pull of  plates, but it has been shown that the dip of the subduction zones is not  correlated with the age and the thermal state of the downgoing  plates.""  ""In fact there are slabs where, moving along strike, the  age of the downgoing lithosphere varies, but the dip remains the same, or  vice versa, the age remains constant while the dip varies (Philippines).  There are cases where the age decreases and the dip increases (Western  Indonesia), and other subduction zones where the age increases and the dip  decreases (Sandwich).  This shows that there is not a first order  relationship between slab dip and lithospheric age."" 9               Finally, no matter how it is computed, ""results do not support a  correlation between slab length percentage (length of the trench compared to  the length of the whole boundary around the plate) and plate  velocity."" 9               Why should the lithosphere start              to subduct at all?  ""Hydrated and serpentinized oceanic              lithosphere that has not yet been metamorphosed by the subduction              process... is still less dense.""  Slab pull has been calculated              to become potentially efficient only at a certain depth, around              180 km.  Shallower than that, how is subduction initiated? 9               ""This long list casts doubts              on the possibility that slab pull can actually trigger subduction... and              drive plate motions."" 9               Another researcher highlights              the basic problem for plate tectonics theory               ""Why convection in Earth's              mantle gives rise to plate tectonics is not obvious.  The top              thermal boundary layer is supposed to be very stiff because the              viscosity of silicate rocks is strongly temperature-dependent.  This              temperature dependency is so strong that so-called stagnant lid              convection should be the most likely mode of mantle convection;              the entire surface should be covered by just one single plate, not              by a number of rigid plates.""  ""What is needed for              the self-consistent generation of plate tectonics  is... a              mechanism to initiate subduction.""  Consider moderate-age              oceanic lithosphere, say 100 million years old.  Even at a              ""depth range of 10-45 km, oceanic lithosphere of this age is              too stiff to be deformed by any reasonable tectonic stress, resulting              in a fatal bottleneck for the operation of plate tectonics.""                ""The currently available estimate suggests that              yield strength for this 'semi-brittle' regime is still on the order              of 600-800 MPa [6000-8000 bars].""  ""It is known that the              self-consistent numerical modeling of plate tectonics (i.e., plate              tectonics naturally arising from buoyancy distribution and given              rheology, not imposed by boundary conditions) is impossible with              such high yield stress.  In all previous attempts to simulate              plate tectonics in a self-consistent fashion, therefore mantle rheology              is modified in one way or another"" to get the desired result. 22                                                                                           ***********               1.  Alvarez, Walter.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidizes readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes   Main article:  Allotropes of iron   Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallizes at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy          The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore   See also:  Iron ore          Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace   Main article:  Blast furnace          Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes   Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks   Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content, the higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes   Main article:  Isotopes of iron   Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b       Main article:  Human iron metabolism   Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption, high blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidizes readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes   Main article:  Allotropes of iron   Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallizes at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .

Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth.

Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy          The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore   See also:  Iron ore          Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace   Main article:  Blast furnace          Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes   Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks   Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content, the higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes   Main article:  Isotopes of iron   Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b       Main article:  Human iron metabolism   Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption, high blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidizes readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes   Main article:  Allotropes of iron   Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallizes at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy          The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore   See also:  Iron ore          Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace   Main article:  Blast furnace          Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture .

In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes   Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks   Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content, the higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes   Main article:  Isotopes of iron   Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b       Main article:  Human iron metabolism   Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption, high blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

The lithosphere is underlain by the  asthenosphere , the weaker, hotter, and deeper part of the upper mantle. The boundary between the lithosphere and the underlying asthenosphere is defined by a difference in response to stress: the lithosphere remains rigid for long periods of geologic time, where as the asthenosphere is plastic. The lithosphere is fragmented into  plate tectonics  (shown in the picture), which move independently relative to one another.   The concept of the lithosphere as Earths strong outer layer was developed by  Barrell , who wrote a series of papers introducing the concept (Barrell 1914a-c). The concept was based on the presence of significant gravity anomalies over continental crust, from which he inferred that there must exist a strong upper layer (which he called the lithosphere) above a weaker layer which could flow (which he called the asthenosphere). These ideas were enlarged by Daly (1940), and have been broadly accepted by geologists and geophysicists. Although these ideas about lithosphere and asthenosphere were developed long before plate tectonic theory was articulated in the 1960s, the concepts that strong lithosphere exists and that this rests on weak asthenosphere are essential to that theory.   The lithosphere provides a conductive lid atop the convecting mantle; as such, it affects heat transport through the Earth.   The division of Earth's outer layers into lithosphere and asthenosphere should not be confused with the chemical subdivision of the outer Earth into  mantle , and  crust . All crust is in the lithosphere, but lithosphere generally contains more mantle than crust.   There are two types of lithosphere:     Oceanic lithosphere, which is associated with  Oceanic crust   Continental lithosphere, which is associated with  Continental crust       [ edit ]   Oceanic lithosphere   Oceanic lithosphere is typically about 50-100 km thick (but beneath the  mid-ocean ridges  is no thicker than the crust), while continental lithosphere has a range in thickness from about 40 km to perhaps 200 km; the upper ~30 to ~50 km of typical continental lithosphere is  crust . The mantle part of the lithosphere consists largely of  peridotite . The crust is distinguished from the upper mantle by the change in chemical composition that takes place at the  Moho discontinuity .   Oceanic lithosphere consists mainly of  mafic  crust and  ultramafic  mantle ( peridotite ) and is denser than continental lithosphere, for which the mantle is associated with crust made of  felsic  rocks. Oceanic lithosphere thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid-ocean ridge. This thickening occurs by conductive cooling, which converts hot asthenosphere into lithospheric mantle, and causes the oceanic lithosphere to become increasingly thick and dense with age. Oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years, but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere. The gravitational instability of mature oceanic lithosphere has the effect that at  subduction zones  the oceanic lithosphere invariably sinks underneath the overriding lithosphere, which can be oceanic or continental. New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 170 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old. The oldest parts of continental lithosphere underlie  cratons , and the mantle lithosphere there is thicker and less dense than typical; the relatively low density of such mantle ""roots of cratons"" helps to stabilize these regions (e.g., Jordan, 1978).     [ edit ]   Mantle   Another distinguishing characteristic of the lithosphere is its flow properties. Under the influence of the low-intensity, long-term stresses that drive  plate tectonic  motions, the lithosphere responds essentially as a rigid shell and thus deforms primarily through brittle failure, whereas the  asthenosphere  (the layer of the mantle below the lithosphere) is heat-softened and accommodates  strain  through  plastic  deformation.   Geoscientists can directly study the nature of the subcontinental mantle by examining mantle  xenoliths  brought up in  kimberlite  and other volcanic pipes. The histories of these xenoliths have been investigated by many methods, including analyses of abundances of isotopes of  osmium  and  rhenium . Such studies have confirmed that mantle lithospheres below some  cratons  have persisted for periods in excess of 3 billion years, despite the mantle flow that accompanies plate tectonics (e.g., Carlson et al., 2005).

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidizes readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes   Main article:  Allotropes of iron   Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallizes at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .

Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth.

Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy          The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore   See also:  Iron ore          Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace   Main article:  Blast furnace          Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture .

In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes   Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks   Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content, the higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes   Main article:  Isotopes of iron   Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b       Main article:  Human iron metabolism   Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption, high blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

Courtesy of MMA Renewable Ventures                                                                           Advertisement                                                                      Global Solar Energy , a maker of thin-film solar cells, has proven to be its own best customer.   The first commercial solar energy system using Global Solar's copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) cells is now working to power none other than Global Solar's own 40-megawatt factory in Tucson, Ariz.   Solon Corp.  in Germany made the solar panels containing the CIGS cells. It also designed the 750-kilowatt system, which is made up of 6,600 panels spread over 310,000 square feet of space on the ground.   Solon, which also makes cyrstalline siliocn panels, began exploring the thin-film market about three years ago, said Lars Podlowski, chief technical officer of Solon, at a Photon International conference in San Francisco Wednesday. The company bought a 19 percent stake in Global Solar in 2006.   The energy system Global Solar has installed will feed 25 percent of the factory's power needs.   Global Solar doesn't have to pay for the system though.  MMA Renewable Ventures  put up the undisclosed cost of installing the system. MMA, based in Baltimore, Md., owns and operates the system and sells the electricity to Global Solar through a long-term contract.   MMA also will recoup some of the cost by selling the renewable energy credits from the project to utility Tucson Electric Power.   The solar energy system is the not just the first for Global Solar, but the first commercial CIGS system in the market, the company said. ""First"" though is in the eyes of the beholder.   Other CIGS makers, such as Fremont, Calif.-based Solyndra, have erected smaller, but still multiple-kilowatt, demonstration plants. Whether a CIGS manufacturer setting up a system for its own use is commercial remains to be a judgment call. Still, the size of the deployment buoys optimism that CIGS mass manufacturing is on the way.   CIGS is one of the thin-film technologies being developed by companies hankering for a slice of the growing solar market. The vast majority of solar panels sold today use crystalline silicon as their key sunlight-converting ingredient. Many believe CIGS solar panels will be more efficient and more economical than thin-film cells made with cadmium telluride or amorphous silicon.   Few CIGS companies, however, are actually making products and even fewer are shipping in anything a reasonable person might call high volumes. CIGS is not easy to work with.   Solyndra began shipping its panels in July and has announced $1.52 billion worth of sales contracts (see  Solyndra Rolls Out Tube-Shaped Thin Film  and  Solyndra Snags $320M Deal with Roofing Firm ). Those sales contracts allow Solyndra to deliver that $1.52 billion worth of solar panels over the next four to five years.   In Dec. 2007, Nanosolar announced it had begun producing CIGS panels. Those panels were heading to Beck Energy for a 1-megawatt project in Germany. (see  Nanosolar Begins Production) . How many panels Nansolar has delivered remains a mystery and a major subject of debate in Silicon Valley.   Nanosolar also is developing a second power plant in Germany (see  Nansolar to Build a 10MW Power Plant ).   Global Solar sets itself apart from other CIGS players by only producing cells, which are assembled into panels by customers (see  Global Solar Strings Thin-Film Market Together  and  Global Solar Sells Out Year's Production ).   The company celebrated the opening of a 35-megawatt factory in Germany last month.   In July, the company said it was on track to reach full production at its 40-megawatt factory. The plant was running at a rate between 5 megawatts to 10 megawatts at the time.    The company isn't reaching that goal, however. During his talk, Podlowski said the company aims to reach the production capacity of 25 megawatts next year and make cells at $2.50 per watt.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common source of  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon  burning in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. They are used for structural purposes, as their alloy content raises their cost and necessitates justification of their use. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.

Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron -- which binds non-specifically to many cellular components -- can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables (haem iron), [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

Trends plotted since January 1982.       Satellite temperature measurements  have been obtained from the  troposphere  since 1978. By comparison, the usable balloon ( radiosonde ) record begins in 1958.   Satellites  do not measure  temperature  as such. They measure  radiances  in various  wavelength  bands, which must then be mathematically  inverted  to obtain  indirect inferences  of temperature. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  The resulting temperature profiles depend on details of the methods that are used to obtain temperatures from radiances. As a result, different groups that have analyzed the satellite data to calculate temperature trends have obtained a range of values. Among these groups are  Remote Sensing Systems  (RSS) and the  University of Alabama in Huntsville  (UAH).   To compare to the increase from the  surface record  (of approximately +0.07 C/decade over the past century and +0.17 C/decade since 1979) it is more appropriate to derive trends for the lower  troposphere  in which the  stratospheric  cooling is removed. Doing this, through December 2008:     RSS v3.1 finds a trend of +0.157 C/decade. [ 3 ]   UAH analysis finds +0.13C/decade. [ 4 ]     An alternative adjustment introduced by Fu  et al.  (2004) [ 5 ]  finds trends (1979-2001) of +0.19 C/decade when applied to the RSS data set. [ 6 ]  A less regularly updated analysis is that of Vinnikov and Grody with +0.20C per decade (19782004). [ 7 ] , although it must be noted that RSS also has a higher trend when taken only to 2004 (+0.186 C/decade)   In 1996, Hurrell and Trenberth published in the Journal of Climate an analysis showing a warming trend of +0.18 C/decade from 1979-1995. [ 8 ]   Using the T2 channel (which include significant contributions from the  stratosphere , which has cooled), Mears et al. of Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) find (through March 2008) a trend of +0.110 C/decade. [ 3 ]  Spencer and Christy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), find a smaller trend of +0.050 C/decade. [ 9 ]   The satellite records have the advantage of global coverage, whereas the radiosonde record is longer. There have been complaints of data problems with both records, and difficulty reconciling climate model predictions with the observed data.

Globally, the troposphere should warm about 1.2 times more than the surface; in the tropics, the troposphere should warm about 1.5 times more than the surface. For some time the only available satellite record was the UAH version, which showed cooling globally. A longer data series and several corrections to the UAH method leaves the UAH series showing warming, though less than RSS version. In 2001, an extensive, but now somewhat dated, comparison and discussion of trends from different data sources and periods was given in the Third Assessment Report of the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) (section 2.2.4) [ 10 ] .   A detailed analysis produced by dozens of scientists as part of the US  Climate Change Science Program  (CCSP) identified and corrected errors in the satellite data and other temperature observations.   The  CCSP SAP 1.1 Executive Summary  states:     ""Previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of humaninduced global warming. Specifically, surface data showed substantial global-average warming, while early versions of satellite and radiosonde data showed little or no warming above the surface. This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected. New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies.""     The  IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Summary for Policymakers  states:     ""New analyses of balloon-borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospheric temperature show warming rates that are similar to those of the surface temperature record and are consistent within their respective uncertainties, largely reconciling a discrepancy noted in the TAR.""     However, as detailed in  CCSP SAP 5.1 Understanding and Reconcilling Differences , neither Regression models or other related techniques were reconcilable with observed data. The use of fingerprinting techniques on data yielded that ""Volcanic and human-causedfingerprints were not consistently identifiable in observed patterns of lapse rate change."" As such, issues with reconciling data and models remain.   A potentially serious inconsistency has been identified in the tropics, the area in which tropospheric amplification should be seen. Section 1.1 of the CCSP report says:     ""In the tropics, the agreement between models and observations depends on the time scale considered. For month-to-month and year-to-year variations, models and observations both show amplification (i.e., the month-to-month and year-to-year variations are larger aloft than at the surface). This is a consequence of relatively simple physics, the effects of the release of latent heat as air rises and condenses in clouds. The magnitude of this amplification is very similar in models and observations. On decadal and longer time scales, however, while almost all model simulations show greater warming aloft (reflecting the same physical processes that operate on the monthly and annual time scales), most observations show greater warming at the surface.       ""These results could arise either because real world amplification effects on short and long time scales are controlled by different physical mechanisms, and models fail to capture such behavior; or because non-climatic influences remaining in some or all of the observed tropospheric data sets lead to biased long-term trends; or a combination of these factors. The new evidence in this Report favors the second explanation.""     The lower troposphere trend derived from UAH satellites (+0.128 C/decade) is currently lower than both the GISS and Hadley Centre surface station network trends (+0.161 and +0.160 C/decade respectively), while the RSS trend (+0.158 C/decade) is similar. However, the expected trend in the lower troposphere, given the surface data, would be around 0.194 C/decade, making the UAH and RSS trends 66% and 81% of the expected value respectively.     [ edit ]   The satellite temperature record   Since 1979,  Microwave Sounding Units  (MSUs) on  NOAA  polar orbiting satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric  oxygen . The intensity is proportional to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere, as demonstrated by theory and direct comparisons with atmospheric temperatures from radiosonde (balloon) profiles. Upwelling radiance is measured at different frequencies; these different frequency bands sample a different weighted range of the atmosphere. [ 11 ]  Channel 2 is broadly representative of the troposphere, albeit with a significant overlap with the lower stratosphere (the weighting function has its maximum at 350 hPa and half-power at about 40 and 800 hPa). In an attempt to remove the stratospheric influence, Spencer and Christy developed the synthetic ""2LT"" product by subtracting signals at different view angles; this has a maximum at about 650 hPa. However this amplifies noise, [ 12 ]  increases inter-satellite calibration biases and enhances surface contamination. [ 13 ]  The 2LT product has gone through numerous versions as various corrections have been applied.   Records have been created by merging data from nine different MSUs, each with peculiarities (e.g., time drift of the spacecraft relative to the local solar time) that must be calculated and removed because they can have substantial impacts on the resulting trend. [ 14 ]   The process of constructing a temperature record from a radiance record is difficult. The best-known, though controversial, record, from  Roy Spencer  and  John Christy  at the  University of Alabama in Huntsville  (UAH), is currently version 5.2, which corrects previous errors in their analysis for orbital drift and other factors. The record comes from a succession of different satellites and problems with inter-calibration between the satellites are important, especially NOAA-9, which accounts for most of the difference between the RSS and UAH analyses  [ 15 ] . NOAA-11 played a significant role in a 2005 study by Mears  et al.  identifying an error in the diurnal correction that leads to the 40% jump in Spencer and Christy's trend from version 5.1 to 5.2. [ 16 ]   For some time, the UAH satellite data's chief significance was that they appeared to contradict a wide range of surface temperature data measurements and analyses showing warming in line with that estimated by climate models. In April 2002, for example, an analysis of the satellite temperature data showed warming of only 0.04 C per decade, compared with surface measurements showing 0.17 +/- 0.06 C per decade. The correction of errors in the analysis of the satellite data, as noted above, have brought the two data sets more closely in line with each other.   Christy  et al.  (2007) find that the tropical temperature trends from  radiosondes  matches closest with his v5.2 UAH dataset. [ 17 ]  Furthermore, they assert there is a growing discrepancy between RSS and sonde trends beginning in 1992, when the NOAA-12 satellite was launched [ 18 ] . This research found that the tropics were warming, from the balloon data, +0.09 (corrected to UAH) or +0.12 (corrected to RSS) or 0.05 K (from UAH MSU; 0.07 K room for error) a decade.     [ edit ]   Discussion of the satellite temperature records   In the late 1990s the disagreement between the surface temperature record and the satellite records was a subject of research and debate. The lack of warming then seen in the records was noted. [ 19 ]  A report by the  National Research Council  that reviewed upper air temperature trends stated:     ""Data collected by satellites and balloon-borne instruments since 1979 indicate little if any warming of the low- to mid-tropospherethe atmospheric layer extending up to about 5 miles from the Earth's surface. Climate models generally predict that temperatures should increase in the upper air as well as at the surface if increased concentrations of greenhouse gases are causing the warming."" [ 20 ]     However, the same panel then concluded that     ""the warming trend in global-mean surface temperature observations during the past 20 years is undoubtedly real and is substantially greater than the average rate of warming during the twentieth century. The disparity between surface and upper air trends in no way invalidates the conclusion that surface temperature has been rising."" [ 21 ] [ 22 ]     As noted earlier, these temperature data, misinterpreted from the satellite data, are now known to have been too low.   An important critique of the satellite record is its shortnessadding a few years on to the record or picking a particular time frame can change the trends considerably. The problems with the length of the MSU record is shown by the table below, which shows the UAH TLT (lower tropospheric) global trend (C/decade) beginning with Dec 1978 and ending with December of the year shown.     1991     0.087   1992     0.024   1993    -0.013   1994    -0.003   1995     0.033   1996     0.036   1997     0.040   1998     0.112   1999     0.105   2000     0.095   2001     0.103   2002     0.121   2003     0.129   2004     0.130   2005     0.139   2006     0.140   2007     0.143    Likewise, even though they began with the same data, each of the major research groups has interpreted it with different results. Most notably, Mears et al. at RSS find 0.193 C/decade for lower troposphere up to July 2005, compared to +0.123 C/decade found by UAH for the same period.   There are ongoing efforts to resolve these differences. Some believe that much of the disparity may have been resolved by the three papers in Science,  11 August   2005 , which pointed out errors in the UAH 5.1 record and the radiosonde record in the tropics.     [ edit ]   Satellite measurements of the stratospheric temperature   The satellites also measure the lower stratospheric temperature [ citation needed ]  and show a decline in stratospheric temperatures, interspersed by warmings related to volcanic eruptions.  Global Warming  theory suggests that the  stratosphere  should cool while the  troposphere  warms [ citation needed ] . However, the lower stratospheric record is mostly explained by the effects  ozone depletion , which has caused a cooling of the stratosphere [ 23 ] .     [ edit ]   Weather balloons (radiosondes)   The longest data sets of upper air temperature are derived from instruments carried aloft by balloons (radiosondes). The  radiosonde  data set becomes usably global in about 1958. Changes in balloon instrumentation and data processing over the years have been pervasive, however, resulting in discontinuities in these temperature records [ 24 ] . The Sherwood  et al.  (2005) study looked at solar heating issues and found a spurious trend of about -.16K per decade had been introduced into the record, asserting that this masked the true warming, particularly in the tropical regions. [ 25 ]  This is enough to make the trend compatible with surface warming. Christy  et al.  (2007) [ 17 ]  acknowledge the spurious trends in the radiosondes and assert that ""[w]hen the largest discontinuities in the sondes are detected and removed,"" a cooler heating trend (in line with their UAH v5.2 dataset) than the one previously held is found. [ 18 ]   The radiosondes and the MSU were designed to detect short term changes in temperatures and not long term trends so it would be inappropriate to criticize them for being poor for long term trend detection. Other problems with the radiosondes in addition to the recently discovered solar heating issue could remain in the data.     [ edit ]   References       ^   National Research Council (U.S.).

By Roberta C. Barbalace    [Oct. 2004]    The story of asbestos is an all to familiar one, ""A miraculous, do anything chemical substance is identified as a serious health hazard"" - except for one thing.  Unlike many of its doomed chemical contemporaries, asbestos is not a product of modern technology.  Its use predates history, and the recognition of health hazards associated with asbestos is recorded in writings from the first century.    The word asbestos comes from the Greek word meaning ""inextinguishable"" or ""indestructible.""  However, asbestos has been known by many other names including: ""mountain leather,"" ""incombustible linen,"" and ""rock floss.""  The name of chrysotile, one of the most common forms of asbestos, is derived from the Greek words ""chrysos"" (gold) and ""tilos"" (fiber) or ""gold fiber.""      It is possible to trace written documentation of the use of asbestos back to the days of the Roman Empire.  However, evidence of the use of asbestos in pottery and chinking of log homes dating back 3000 BC has been found archeological digs in Scandinavia.   The geographer in the first century identified what was believed to be the first asbestos quarry on the Greek island of Evvoia.  In early Greek and Roman times, it was used for flame retardant cloth, building materials and women's clothing.  Roman restaurants used tablecloths made of asbestos.  These tablecloths were flame retardant and could be thrown into the fire to remove food and other debris, and placed back on the table for the next customer.  Romans also used asbestos in their building materials.  Historian Pliny the Elder went so far as to note that asbestos ""affords protection against all spells, particularly that of the Magi.""    Asbestos was used by many different cultures for hundreds of purposes purposes.  The Egyptians embalmed pharos with asbestos, and the Persians imported asbestos from India for wrapping their dead.  They thought it was hair from a small animal that lived by fire and died by water.     In medieval times Asbestos was used extensively as insulation in suits of armor.  And unscrupulous merchants made it into crosses that they advertised as having been made from ""the true cross.""  Some forms of asbestos look like old wood, and merchants claimed that their resistance to fire was proof that these ""wooden crosses"" came from cross on which Christ was hung.  .     Near the end of the 19th century, the use asbestos became even more widespread as a result of the industrial revolution.  Asbestos was used in the manufacture of more than 3000 products including textiles, building materials, insulation and brake linings.  Its use continued to increase through the 1970s.  At that time the evidence against asbestos as a health hazard (it was found to cause asbestosis and mesothelioma) could no longer be denied, and its use fell into sudden decline.    Interestingly enough, the hazards of asbestos were recorded as early as Roman times.  Both Pliny the Elder and the first century geographer Strabo noted that workers exposed to asbestos had many health problems. Pliny the Elder recommended that quarry slaves from asbestos mines not be purchased because ""they die young.""  Lung ailments were common to anyone who worked with asbestos fibers.  Pliny the Elder suggested the use of a respirator made of transparent bladder skin to protect workers from asbestos dust.     In 1897 a Viennese physician attributed emaciation and pulmonary problems to (asbestos) dust inhalation.  The first documented case of an asbestos-related death was reported in 1906 when the autopsy of an asbestos worker revealed lung  fibrosis .  As early as 1908 insurance companies began decreasing policies and benefits for asbestos workers.  Metropolitan Life increased the premiums for such workers.  In 1928 Cook identified the effects of asbestos in the lungs as  asbestosis .  He pointed out that this fibrotic scarring of lungs resulting from prolonged exposure to asbestos dust could have a latency period of 15 years.  Others have suggested that the latency period can be much longer.  In 1929 a coroner called for public enquiry after the death of an employee.  By 1935 physicians were beginning to notice that some patients who had  asbestosis  also were victims of lung cancer.    By 1978 documented studies were beginning to demonstrate the extent to which asbestos workers had been affected.  In one study  asbestosis  was detected in 10% of asbestos workers who had been employed in the industry for 10-19 years, in 73% of workers who had been employees 20-29 years and in 92% of workers who had been employed for more than 40 years.     It is interesting that despite the evidence of severe health risks related to exposure to asbestos dating as far back as the first century, the production of products containing asbestos continued to grow until the mid 1970s.  Documents reveal that asbestos manufacturers were aware of the health risks related to exposure to asbestos from the 1940s and 1950s, but chose to conceal this information from their employees.  In the 1970s, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) began to regulate asbestos.  Today workers are protected from exposure to asbestos as a result of very strict regulations and enforcement.  Unfortunately, legislation cannot undo the damage that was done to those who worked in asbestos related jobs prior to 1980s.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

clueweb09-en0003-82-01957	"   Iron   The metal of Mars gives us magnetism and life    Contents      Introduction   Properties of Iron   Mineralogy and Natural History of Iron   Iron and Magnetism   Iron and Blood   References      Introduction    Iron is best known as the metal that gave us weapons and tools, and whose ability by means of alloys and heat treatment to suit itself to every application makes it the primary metal of technology. The purpose of this article, however, is principally to explain in some detail two remarkable applications of iron,  ferromagnetism  and oxygen transport in the blood. The very similar cobalt and nickel will also be included.    Iron is the most freqently encountered metal in daily life, always in the form of manufactured objects, and usually covered with a protective coating or buried deep within the object. Concrete structures contain essential reinforcing iron; electrical machines, including transformers, depend on iron. Automobiles are mainly iron; ""tin"" cans are iron covered with thin coatings of tin or lacquer; fasteners, such as the nails and screws used in wooden construction, are usually iron. This list can easily be extended with a little thought.    Iron is an excellent and versatile material of construction--strong, tough, easily formed and worked, and, very importantly, cheap compared to the alternatives. Plastics give it competition, especially in products that must be manufactured at the lowest cost where strength and durability are not the primary concerns, such as modern American automobiles. Aluminium is a strong competitor where weight is a concern, as in aircraft. However, the versatility of iron-carbon alloys cannot be matched in any other material. Alloys with other metals, such as nickel, chromium and manganese, give further advantages. These  steels  can be tailored to nearly every demand, and are not significantly challenged as materials of construction.    The shortcomings of iron are its weight, and its propensity to rust. Both aluminium and plastics avoid these shortcomings, because their densities are much less than that of iron, and aluminium is protected by an adherent layer of oxide, and plastics by the inertness of the substance. The advantages of iron are so great, however, that these considerations prevail only in limited fields of application.    The three metals iron, cobalt and nickel are called the ""iron family"" and are very similar, so I shall discuss them together. A property of the iron family for which there is no substitute at an equivalent cost is that they can be induced to provide a strong magnetic field with only small excitation by an electric current. It is a very remarkable property, so an effort will be made to explain how it arises, and how it is used. Also, iron is important as a carrier of oxygen in blood, and how it does this will be explained.    In addition to these subjects, the physical and chemical properties of iron will be reviewed, and its curiosities examined, as usual. For some accounts and explanations, reference will be made to other articles where they appear, and will not be duplicated here. This is especially true of the application of iron as an engineering material, a very extensive subject.    Our word  iron  is cognate to the German  Eisen , which in various forms is found in all the northern European languages, though not elsewhere. Why our pronunciation of the word is metathetical, ""iorn"" instead of ""iron,"" I have not heard. In Gothic, it was  eisarn , and in Old High German,  isan . In Greek, iron is  síderos  and steel is  chalybicón , stems that are encountered frequently in talking of iron, as in ""siderurgy"" and ""chalybeate spring."" ""Sidereal time"" is not iron time, however, but the ""sider-"" comes from the similar Latin  sidera , ""stars."" Iron was very valuable when it came to the bronze-age Greeks from its inventors around the Pontus Euxinus, and was used for jewellery and prizes. It has been money in other places and times. The Latin for iron is  ferrum , from which the word in most European languages has been derived, and which appears more commonly than any other stem in words dealing with iron, especially in chemical nomenclature.    Cobalt is from  Kobold , an earth spirit, or a good house spirit. The kobold came surreptitiously and stole the silver from the ore, replacing it with base cobalt. There is a Greek word  kobalos , meaning ""rogue, trickster,"" but there is probably no connection with the German. Nickel is from  Nickel , a water spirit, who took the copper from the ore and washed it away, replacing it with  kupfernickel . A  Nix  is a male water spirit, a  Nixe  a female water spirit. These names were from miner's slang, not traditional names for the metals, which were unknown at the time. Many minerals resemble ores, but do not yield the expected metal, and this was confusing when their chemical natures were not known. Cobalt was recognized by Brandt in 1735 and nickel by Cronstadt in 1750, but their compounds were not carefully studied until the next century.       Properties of Iron    Iron is a shiny, bright white metal that is soft, malleable, ductile and strong. Its surface is usually discolored by corrosion, since it combines readily with the oxygen of the air in the presence of moisture. In absolutely dry air, it does not rust. The oxide that is produced is crumbly and soft, giving no protection to the base metal, which eventually rusts away. It is found in nature as the metal only in meteorites and in very rare circumstances where iron minerals have been reduced by environmental factors. Masses up to 25 tons in weight have been found in West Greenland. Practically, it is always obtained from ores that are usually the oxides, and occasionally the carbonate, as low in sulphur and phosphorus as possible. The plentiful iron pyrite, FeS 2  is not an acceptable ore because sulphur is a deleterious impurity in iron, and expensive to remove in refining. Iron is the fourth most plentiful element in the earth's crust (4.6%), but is so widely disseminated that it can be obtained only from ores in which iron has been specially concentrated. Much of this concentration, incidentally, occurred very early in the earth's history when iron removed from the atmosphere the little oxygen that it then contained, possibly with the help of the earliest forms of life.    A clean surface of cobalt is tinged with pink, nickel with yellow. Neither rusts as vigorously as iron, since the oxide layers are more protective and adherent. Nickel displays a resistant bright surface that takes a high polish. It is generally used as an undercoat for chromium plating, since chromium is not suitable by itself on iron, as the electrodeposited film is not continuous.    Iron has atomic number 26, atomic weight 55.85, and stable isotopes 54 (5.9%), 56 (91.6%), 57 (2.2%) and 58 (0.33%). Its electron configuration is Ar3d 6 4s 2 , and its first and second ionization potentials are 7.87V and 16.18V. With its neighbors cobalt (Z=27) and nickel (Z=28), it is one of the ""iron triad"" of similar metals. It is in the center of the periodic table, in the region of ""transition metals"" where a d-shell of electrons is being filled. The 4s electrons are actually more stable than the 3d electrons, so the d-electrons are actually on the outside of the atom. The d-shell can hold 10 electrons, and as it becomes nearly filled, drops below the 4s electrons in energy. All these atoms filling d-shells make metals that are very much alike; if the d-electrons were more inside, these metals would be even more alike than they are. More will be said in connection with magnetism, in which these electrons play leading roles.    At room temperature, iron is in the form of  ferrite , or α-iron, a body-centered cubic structure. The density of α-iron is 7.86 g/cc. At 910°C it changes to γ-iron, which is face-centered cubic and somewhat softer. At 1535°C iron melts, and boils at 3000°C. For more information on iron structures and the iron-carbon phase diagram, see  Phase Rules! . Cobalt melts at 1480°C, nickel at 1455°C. The specific heat of any of the three metals is about 0.107 cal/g-K. The thermal conductivities of Fe, Co and Ni are 3.37, 3.81 and 4.19 cal/s-cm-K. Their electrical resistivities are 9.71, 6.24 and 6.84 μΩ-cm. These are ""worse"" than those of copper by factors of only 4 to 6, so the iron metals are very good conductors of electricity and heat. Comparing the numbers shows how similar these metals are in their physical properties. I have not heard whether cobalt and nickel make useful alloys with carbon, as iron does. They are much too expensive to use as structural metals, other than as alloying elements or coatings.    Iron occurs as the cations Fe ++ , ferrous iron, and Fe +++ , ferric iron. Nickel and cobalt occur mainly as the dipositive ions, nickelous and cobaltous, but also in other oxidation states, usually in unstable compounds. A large number of important salts are formed with various anions. Fe ++  will gladly donate an electron in an acid solution or in the presence of oxygen, so it is a reducing agent, oxidizing itself to Fe +++ . In alkaline solution, this ion will gladly accept an electron, so it is an oxidizing agent, reducing itself to the ferrous state. In acid solution, Fe will reduce H +  to H 2 , since its electrode potential is -0.44V, well above hydrogen's. Iron is, in fact, an active element.    The oxides are ferrous oxide, FeO and ferric oxide, Fe 2 O 3 . Ferrous oxide is not stable against partial oxidation to Fe(II)(Fe(III) 2 O 4 ), usually written Fe 3 O 4  or FeO·Fe 2 O 3 . This hard, black substance is  magnetite , an important ore of iron and a very interesting substance in its own right, which will be considered further in connection with magnetism, where its structure will be explained.     The ferrous ion is greenish in solution, while the ferric ion is a light violet. The distinct colors of iron compounds are due to the d-electrons, which can interact with light in many interesting ways. Ferrous oxide, as a mineral, is called  hematite  (""blood-stone"") and is usually almost black. It leaves a red streak on unglazed porcelain, and in its usually finely-divided condition is a characteristic bright earthy red. In pure form, it is called  rouge , good for reddening cheeks and polishing glass, or  Venetian red , a red pigment. The red stains on concrete are ferric oxide, usually from reinforcement rods that are not properly protected from the weather. The red of Mars is ferric oxide, showing that the atmosphere once contained oxygen, the oxygen that is only liberated by life.    Ferrous sulphate, FeSO 4  forms pale green crystals of the heptahydrate when a solution is evaporated. In air, these crystals will attract moisture and oxygen, and slowly become ferric. This salt is called  copperas  or  green vitriol . In alkaline solution, gelatinous Fe(OH) 2  precipitates, which likewise oxidizes in air through green, black and finally to red-brown ferric oxide. Ferrous tannate is obtained by mixing ferrous sulphate and tannic acid (from nut-galls, for example). This oxidizes in air to black ferric tannate, and so the solution is used as an ink. A dark-blue dye is generally added, since the ferrous tannate is almost colorless. By the time the dye has bleached in the light, the ferric tannate will be distinct. This kind of ink eventually rusts to ferric oxide, and is not nearly as permanent as India ink made from colloidal carbon. It is not as susceptible to clogging, however, and flows easily from the pen. It can be removed from fabrics with oxalic acid or ammonium oxalate, which dissove the iron. This was called ""permanent ink"" to distinguish it from ""washable ink"" that contained water-soluble dyes and was even less durable.    Anhydrous ferric chloride is a covalent compound FeCl 3  that dissolves in organic solvents as well as in water. It forms bright-yellow crystals as the hexahydrate. Anhydrous ferric sulphate is colorless, but crystals of Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 ·9h 2 O are yellow. Ferric ammonium alum, FeNH 4 (SO 4 ) 2 ·12H 2 O is pale violet, the typical ferric color in solution. This is an ""alum"" without aluminium, the iron standing it for it. It is a mordant because of the gelatinous ferric hydroxide formed when a solution is make alkaline. There are also ferric potassium alum, also colorless or violet, and ferrous ammonium sulphate, which forms blue-green crystals of the hexahydrate.    The cyanide ion, CN - , and its relatives, accompany iron in many interesting compounds. The free cyanide ion is very poisonous, since it blocks nerve communications. This poison is purely in the structure, again, and there is nothing inherently poisonous about cyanide. Iron forms strong complexes with six cyanides, binding the carbon tightly and pointing the nitrogens to the vertices of an octahedron. If the iron is ferrous, the charge is -4, and if it is ferric, the charge is -3. This is the  ferrocyanide  or  ferricyanide  anion, which makes many salts in aqueous solution or ionic crystals. It even combines with iron, to form ferric ferrocyanide, ferric ferricyanide, ferrous ferrocyanide and ferrous ferricyanide, and often potassium joins in. Potassium ferrous ferricyanide is  Prussian blue , ferrous ferricyanide is  Turnbull's blue . Potassium ferrocyanide, also called potassium berlinate or potassium prussiate, is yellow, and can be obtained in the distillation of coal. Potassium ferricyanide is red. Solutions of ferrocyanide and ferricyanide show no evidence of either iron or cyanide, and are not poisonous. An Italian terrorist who plotted to poison with ferrocyanide was doomed to failure by his ignorance. Some colorless ferricyanides turn the urine blue, which was a typical prank among chemistry students. Prussian blue is now marketed as the prescription medicine Radiogardase, which aids elimination of thallium and caesium, beneficial when radioactive isotopes of these have been ingested, and also in cases of thallium poisoning, which is extremely serious. Caesium does not appear to be very poisonous. The new name would seem to denote an enzyme, which it is not, but at any rate allows sale at a much higher price.    The cyanate ion, CNO -  and the thiocyante ion, CNS -  are equally stable and nonpoisonous. Ferric thiocyanate, Fe(CNS) 3 , is blood-red and an analytical test for iron. It forms red, deliquescent crystals. When carbon monoxide is passed over warm Fe, Co or Ni powder, liquid  carbonyls  are formed, Fe(CO) 5 , Co(CO) 4  and Ni(CO) 4  the uncharged CO sticks to the Fe or Ni by ""resonance"" with states where various formal charges are assigned to the atoms, and a linear combination leads to a minimum energy. The carbons are adjacent to the central metal. A mixture of carbonyls can be fractionally distilled and the pure substances pyrolyzed to recover the metals. The Mond process for refining nickel is based on this property.           Mineralogy and Natural History of Iron    The usual ferrous sulphide, FeS, can add sulphur stochiometrically to form crystalline FeS 2 , known as the mineral  pyrite . This is from the Greek  pyrites , from  pyr , ""fire,"" and meaning something made of fire. When struck by iron, it will produce luminous sparks that can be used to ignite tinder to make fire. The  wheellock  was invented around 1500 for use in cavalry pistols. A spring-driven wheel pressed to a piece of pyrite threw a jet of sparks into the pan. Cavalrymen could not use the usual ""slow match"" of the time because the wind extinguished it. Pyrite gives excellent sparks, probably pieces of FeS 2  heated by impact and burning in air, but is not as durable as flint. Such materials may be called  spintharogenic . Good crystals of pyrite are an excellent brassy yellow color, leading fools to mistake it for gold. However, it is hard and light, not soft and heavy, so it is easily distinguished from gold. In small flakes, however, it could be deceiving, and especially because it is very often associated with gold.    Pyrite crystallizes in the cubic system, and its crystals are typically cubes and pyritohedrons. A pyritohedron has 12 pentagonal faces, but the pentagons are not regular, so the solid is not a dodecahedron. Crystals do not have 5-fold axes. The cube faces are usually striated, each face at right angles to the neighboring faces. Hardness, 6-6.5, and density 4.8-5.1 g/cc. When heated, sulphur is driven off and the iron oxidized to magnetite. Marcasite is orthorhombic instead of cubic, but the same substance. Marcasite is a whiter gold color. Pyrrhotite, a third sulphide, is closer to FeS. It is metallic bronze or brown-colored, softer (H = 3.5-4.5) and a bit lighter (4.40-4.65 g/cc) than pyrite. Notably, it is magnetic, probably ferrimagnetic. Its crystals are hexagonal. Pyrrhotite often contains nickel (as at Sudbury, Ontario) and is one of the most important ores of that metal.   Pyrite is a good source of sulphur, but not a good source of iron because of the sulphur, which ruins iron and is hard to separate from it. It has been used for the manufacture of sulphuric acid. Copperas, the sulphate, is obtained by its oxidation. Mineral copperas often accompanies pyrite as a weathering product. The ""Sparta dollars"" of southern Illinois are thin, round, radial pyrite crystals deposited in the bedding planes of shale. Pyrite is also found in coal, where it adds unwelcome sulphur to the fuel.    Magnetite may be the most important ore of iron. It is found at Kiruna, Sweden, and in other regions of ancient and metamorphic rocks. It (rarely) forms beautiful shiny black octahedral crystals, as well as rhombododecahedrons. It is hard, 5.5-6/5 and rather heavy, d = 5.18 g/cc. It dissolves in hydrochloric acid, and, of course, is strongly magnetic. Lodestone is a magnetized lump of magnetite that attracts iron. Lodestone is found at Magnet Cove, Arkansas, among other places.    Hematite and limonite are ferric oxide, Fe 2 O 3 . In massive form, hematite is black, but when finely divided, red. There is an earthy variety of hematite that is brick red and a good paint pigment. It was called  reddle  and used to paint distinguishing marks on sheep.  Reniform  hematite looks like beef kidney, with metallic lustre. It is usually the product of oxidation of other iron minerals, often with secondary enrichment. The exhausted rich hematite ores of the iron ranges of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan were formed from iron silicates and and carbonates of early sedimentary origin. The Clinton iron bed of Alabama is also secondary hematite, as are the Brazilian ores.    Limonite is colloidal hydrated ferric oxide, yellow to brown in color. It is light, density 3.6-4.0 g/cc. Used as paint, limonite is known as  ochre  (see below). It is widely distributed, as in the Jurassic ores of eastern England (no longer exploited). It is a supergene concentration of iron from sedimentary rocks. Colloidal materials were long called amorphous, but they are actually microcrystalline. Goethite is crystalline hydrated ferric oxide, FeO(OH), much like limonite but crystalline (orthorhombic). It is brownish-black, yellowish or reddish. It was found in Cornwall, Alsace-Lorraine (the ""minette"" ores), Altenberg in Saxony, Lake Onega in Russia, and Jackson Iron mine, Michigan. Goethite was named in honor of the poet and scientist J. W. von Göthe (1749-1832).         Bog iron ore  is limonite or goethite, deposited with the aid of  iron bacteria  in anaerobic swamps. The iron is carried in by waters containing CO 2  as soluble bicarbonates. The organic matter reduces it to oxides, which make characteristic iridescent patches on the water, then precipitate on the bottom of the marsh to form an iron-rich layer. It was smelted at Lynn, Massachusetts with oyster shells and charcoal to be hammered into bars to be traded for slaves in Africa, which were sold in the Caribbean for sugar to be brought to New England for fermentation and distillation into rum to be sold to the Indians, making the fortunes of Boston and Providence. The Lynn ironworks have been reconstructed, but with questionable fidelity.    Ferric oxide is the basis for many pigments of earthy colors, generally through forms of the minerals hematite and limonite, but also through the weathering of sandstones containing an iron cement, or of ferruginous shales. The most familiar color is  ochre , also known as raw sienna or oxide yellow. To me, it is a tan, not a bright yellow like cadmium yellow. Burnt sienna is darker and redder, perhaps a tuscan red. Raw umber is definitely brown, and burnt umber a dark brown that is called Vandyke brown. The color names are drawn from the ferruginous earths of Siena and Umbria. Ingredients other than ferric oxide, such as the manganese in sienna earth, may give characteristic shadings of color. Colors are notoriously difficult to name and describe, so a good color book is a great help.    The iron group are the only metals that fall from the sky. There is a lot of débris in space that enters the earth's atmosphere at 10-30 km/s relative velocity (much of this is the earth's orbital velocity of 30 km/s). These particles, mostly microscopic, cause the trail of a  meteor . A lot of these are cometary particles, ices and dust, but these never reach the ground, burning up between 50 and 150 km altitude, roughly the domain of the ionosphere. A bright magnitude-0 meteor is less than 8 mm in diameter. Millions of meteors burn up in the atmosphere every day, mostly unseen. I make it that they add about 15 kg a year to the earth, but an astronomy text says 10,000 tons a year, which I believe is only enthusiasm and a missed decimal point. The odd large meteorite could put a spike in the average, of course.  The larger lumps, of which there are few, reach the ground before burning or blowing up, and are called  falls , or meteorites. Only Mrs. Hodges of Sylacauga, Alabama has been injured by one, on 30 November 1954. 92% of the falls are  stony  meteorites, 6%  iron  meterorites, and 2%  stony-irons . The stony meteorites are mostly  chondrites , which contain characteristic small glassy spheres. The rest are  carbonaceous chondrites , containing volatile matter, and a few  achondrites  that seem to have been heated to a high temperature. The composition of stony meteorites is very much like that of olivine, 36 O, 23 Fe, 18 Si and 14 Mg. The remaining 9% is very miscellaneous. The average composition of olivine is 38 O, 28 Fe, 17 Si and 18 Mg.    Iron meteorites are nearly pure iron-group metals: 90.7 Fe, 8.5 Ni, 0.6 Co is an average composition. The remaining 0.2% is negligible. They are the most often picked up, since they have a distinctive appearance, unlike the stonies, which look just like stones. When sliced, polished and etched they show the Widmanstätten pattern that shows they cooled slowly. In studying them, Widmanstätten originated metallurgical microscopy. Meteorites are not cometary rubbish; astronomers say they look like the fragments of planetoids like asteroids. The composition of meteorites suggests the composition of the earth: a mantle of olivine covering a ball of iron group metals. The volume ratio of mantle:core is 82:17, not too far from the ratio of stony:iron falls of 92:6.    Iron and Magnetism    The magnetism of the iron group of metals is a rare and remarkable property. It is not due to any inherent magnetic propensities of the atoms, but to the  structure  of the metal. Other substances with similar structures also have similar magnetic properties. The properties that we will explain are called  ferromagnetism ,  antiferromagnetism  and  ferrimagnetism . All three are basically similar, but have different external expressions.    A magnetic field  H  is created by electric currents. It exerts forces on a moving charge q given by  F  = (q/c) v  x  H . Here the charge q is in esu, c is the speed of light, about 3 x 10 10  cm/s, and the magnitude of the magnetic field H is in oersted, which is numerically equal to the magnetic flux density in gauss. In space, there is no difference between field and flux density. Wherever there is a magnetic field, there must be moving charge somewhere to produce it.     An electron moving as in a Bohr atom around a nucleus represents such a current, which produces a magnetic field. If q is the charge, and v is its orbital velocity, then the average current in an orbit of radius r is qv/2πrc. The product of the current and the area of its orbit is called the  magnetic moment  μ of the current. Hence, μ = qvr/2c = q(mvr)/2mc = (q/2mc)(mvr) = (q/2mc)j, where j is the  angular momentum  of the mass m. This is quite a general result, and the quantity in parentheses is called the  gyromagnetic ratio . The  orbital motion  of the electron causes a magnetic moment  μ  = -(e/2mc) j  antiparallel to the angular momentum.     The deBroglie wavelength associated with a momentum p is λ = p/h, where the dimensions of Planck's Constant h work out to erg-sec. The circumference of an orbit of radius r is 2πr, so if an integral number of wavelengths is to fit into it, 2πr/λ = n, an integer. This demands that the angular momentum be an integral multiple of h/2&pi: j = n(h/2π). This means that the magnetic moment will be quantized in multiples of eh/4πmc, which is called the Bohr magneton, μ B , about 0.927 x 10 -20  emu.    A magnetic moment  μ  in a magnetic field  H  is acted upon by a torque tending to turn it in the direction of the field. The energy function that yields this torque on differentiation with respect to the angle is U = - μ · H . The energy differences resulting for various orientations of the atomic magnetic moments should appear in measurements of the wavelengths emitted and absorbed by the atoms, and indeed it does, especially in observations of the Zeeman Effect, when an external magnetic field H is applied.    These measurements (and others) revealed a surprising fact: the electron itself must be regarded as possessing a magnetic moment that interacts with the orbital magnetic moment, as well as an angular momentum. These facts are not consistent with the view of an electron as a point particle, but show that it must have internal structure. Dirac's relativistic theory of the electron showed how this occurs. The electron has an angular momentum, or  spin  of one-half unit, j = h/4π, and a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton. Therefore, the electron is twice as effective in turning angular momentum into magnetic moment. The factor 2 is called the  electron g-factor . Actually, it is very slightly different from 2, and the tiny difference was exactly explained by the theory of quantum electrodynamics, showing that we really do know a lot of what is going on. The spin and g-factor of the electron have no classical analogues.    Closed subshells of electrons have zero angular momentum, hence zero magnetic moment. All the magnetic moment of an atom is due to the electrons in unfilled subshells. The transition metals usually have an unfilled d-shell, so they usually have magnetic moments. The orbital angular momentum of an electron that takes part in bonding, as in metals, is usually  quenched , meaning that it vanishes, along with any magnetic moment, in the quantum-mechanical state. The other electrons may have a magnetic moment. In a crystalline solid, each atom then has a magnetic moment that can rotate freely. When an external field is applied, the moments tend to line up with it, and this is opposed by thermal agitation. The result is  paramagnetism , seen in many substances. The net magnetic moment is proportional to the field,  M  = χ H . The magnetic susceptibility χ is always quite small. Gases behave in a similar manner; oxygen is paramagnetic. If the atom has no magnetic moment, the application of an external field produces a small magnetization in the opposite direction, called  diamagnetism , which is even smaller than paramagnetism.    If there are lots of magnetic moments, then when a magnetization is created in a certain direction, there is a field at any lattice point due to all the magnetic moments at other lattice points. If the crystal is cubic, or if the moments are at random points, as in a gas, then this extra field is (4π/3) M . Since it is in the direction of  M , it acts to strengthen the magnetization. Should it be strong enough, it will cause all the moments to snap over into a single direction spontaneously, without the application of any external field. Alas, it is never strong enough to do this in any paramagnetic substance.    In iron metal, there is a similar interaction that is strong enough to cause all the moments to snap into a single direction. The same occurs in cobalt and nickel. This cannot be the polarizing field we have just mentioned, since it is not strong enough. What happens is that the same electrons that produce the magnetic moments are involved in the metallic binding, and the orientation of the spins of the electrons affect the binding energy of the metal. This is a much stronger interaction than the magnetic interaction of the moments, so it can bring about the desired result. The phenomenon of  magnetostriction  is evidence for this; when iron is magnetized, its shape and size may change slightly because of the coupling of the electron spins and the binding.    In iron, each atom has five d-orbitals which must accommodate six electrons. Linear combinations of the atomic orbitals are used to generate the crystal orbitals, and then the states are filled in order of energy. Some of these orbitals are the metallic binding electrons, and some are more or less located on the ions. In iron, 0.72 electron is devoted to the delocalized metallic binding on the average. To see how the spins affect the energy as electrons are added to the other orbitals, we can look at the helium atom. The two electrons are in the first approximation assigned to hydrogen-like orbitals in an average potential, as if they did not repel one another. Then, the energy of the actual states is found by perturbation theory, using two-electron product states that have been properly antisymmetrized. It is a requirement that any multi-electron state must change signs if the coordinates of the two electrons are interchanged. If the two orbital states are the same, then this can be done if the spins are opposite. If the spins are the same, the state vanishes when an attempt is made to antisymmetrize it, since the states are identical and no linear combination of them can be made to be antisymmetrical. This is called the Pauli Principle, and is a consequence of the exact identity of electrons.    In helium, the electrostatic interaction energy between the electrons is e 2 /r 12 , where r 12  is the distance between the electrons. If the electrons are farther from each other, then the energy is lower. Grinding through the perturbation theory, the resulting energies depend on integrals like J = ∫ f(1)g(2)(e 2 /r 12 )f*(1)g*(2) dv 1 dv 2  and K = ∫ f(1)g(2)(e 2 /r 12 )f*(2)g*(1)dv 1 dv 2 . There is no trick here; these are just the usual ""matrix elements"" used in perturbation theory. J is called a  coulomb integral  and K is called an  exchange integral . It should be clear that there are no physical exchanges either going on or implied; it is just the way it works out with antisymmetric states made of products of one-electron states. This assignment of electrons to orbitals results in two states, one of which has the electron spins opposite and energy J + K, the other of which has the electron spins the same and energy J - K. The energy is lower in the second case because the electrons are farther apart on the average than in the first case. This makes triplet states lower in helium, parallel spin states lower in iron.    The parallel spin states are lower in energy because of the effect on the electrostatic energy, not from any magnetic interactions of the spins. This is a very common result, and holds because the electrostatic interaction is very much stronger than the magnetic. Before this was explained on the basis of quantum mechanics, Weiss postulated a fictitious magnetic field that became known as the Weiss field that would cause the magnetic moments to lock into parallelism. There is no such field, of course, and we have just explained why it looked as if one existed.     The saturation magnetization of iron at 0K is 1752 emu (22,000 gauss). In a cubic centimeter of iron, there are 6.02 x 10 23 (7.86/55.85) iron atoms. The magnetic moment per atom is found by dividing the total moment by the number of atoms, or 2.23 x 10 -20  emu. This is just a little more than two Bohr magnetons, so it appears that about two electrons are effectively unpaired at each atom. For cobalt, the number is 1.72, and for nickel 0.61. If we start with six electrons and five d-orbitals, then two electrons are paired in the lowest crystal d-orbital, two electrons are parallel in the two highest crystal d-orbitals that give the crystal binding and no net magnetic moment, leaving the two middle d-orbitals for one electron each. The fractional numbers quoted above show that there is no integral correspondence of electrons and atom orbitals, so the complete picture must be more complicated. The next atom after nickel, copper, will have no unpaired electrons and cannot be ferromagnetic. There is also no trace of ferromagnetism in the palladium and platinum groups of metals in the next two periods, so we see what a fluke it is to be ferromagnetic.    It can happen that the exchange integral is negative. In this case, the two states reverse their energy order, and the moments are antiparallel in the stable case. This often occurs in oxides, such as FeO, CoO, NiO and MnO. These are face-centered cubic lattices, which can be divided into two sublattices, such that every member of lattice A is surrounded only by members of lattice B, and vice versa. Exchange integrals can be written for A-A, B-B and A-B interactions. The A-B interactions are usually much stronger than the A-A and B-B, and this causes the minimum energy to occur when the magnetic moments on both the A atoms and the B atoms are all in the same direction, but in opposite directions on the A and B atoms. The net moment depends on the difference of the moments on A and B, which is zero, and we have  antiferromagnetism .    If the A and B atoms have different moments, then there will still be a net moment when they are antiparallel, and the material will be spontaneously magnetized. This is called  ferrimagnetism . Ferrimagnetic materials often crystallize in the  spinel  structure. Spinel is MgAl 2 O 4 , consisting of Al-O octahedra with Mg in the tetrahedral voids between the octahedra. Each Al is surrounded by four O's in a plane, of which it has a quarter interest in each, and one above and below, in which it has a half interest, so the unit is AlO 2 - . In the general spinel structure, the place of the Al is taken by a trivalent ion, and the place of the Mg by a divalent ion. If the trivalent ion is Fe +++ , we have a  ferrite . Ferrites are spontaneously magnetized, like a ferromagnetic material, but have no metallic binding and low electrical conductivity. This means that they can be used at high frequencies, where eddy currents make the use of iron impossible. In their applications, they act just like a ferromagnetic material.    The most interesting ferrite is magnetite, Fe 3 O 4 . Half of the ferric iron is on the tetrahedral interstices of the spinel structure, the other half of the ferric iron and all the ferrous iron in the octahedral interstices. The moments of the ferric iron, 5 μ B , cancel, leaving the 4 μ B  of the ferrous ions. Here we can count the electrons and states, since there are no crystal orbitals. Each unit cell contains 8 ferrous ions, so the moment per unit cell will be 8 x 4 Bohr magnetons. The experimental result is 8 x 4.07, so the agreement is excellent.    The earliest experiences with magnetism involved the lodestone, which was magnetite, named for its ability to attract bits of iron. Therefore, magnetism began with ferrites!     Now we must explain how a spontaneously magnetized substance exhibits the magnetic properties familiar to us. If all the moments in a macroscopic sample were aligned, a very strong external magnetic field would be produced. This magnetic field represents a great deal of energy. If the moments were rearranged to reduce this external field, then the overall free energy would be reduced and the state more stable. This could be done, for example, by dividing the sample into two equal parts magnetized in opposite directions. To do this, a boundary between the two regions is required, where the moments reverse directions, and this boundary must absorb some energy. Therefore, the region will tend to divide into regions of different directions of magnetization so long as the net energy saving, field-boundaries is positive. The regions of uniform magnetization are called  domains , and the boundaries  domain walls  or  Bloch walls . An individual crystallite may be a single domain or, more usually, several. The domains are arranged to reduce the external magnetic field to as low a value as possible, as shown in the diagram. Normally, no magnetic field can be detected around the sample.     When we apply an external magnetic field, those domains magnetized in the direction of the field are energy-favored over those magnetized in the opposite direction. The favored domains then expand and the expense of the unfavored, and a net magnetization results. The domains can expand by elastic movements of the domain walls at first, then as the field is increased they may jump over obstacles caused by crystal imperfections, and when the domain walls have moved as far as they can, the magnetization directions of the domains are forced into the direction of the applied field. The result is the familiar S-shaped  magnetization curve  of flux (H + 4πM in gauss) against magnetizing field (H in oersted). If the external field is removed, the domain magnetization returns to easy directions, and the domain walls spring back as well as they can. The magnetization decreases to the  remanence , and the sample has become a  permanent magnet . If now an external field is applied in the reverse direction, the magnetization is reduced to zero when the field has the value of the  coercive force , then increases in the reverse direction as it originally did in the other direction. We are tracing the  hysteresis curve  of the iron. The material does not return to the unmagnetized state except by careful manipulation. All the magnetic applications of the material depend on this behavior. The permeability, the ratio of a change in flux to a change in H, is not constant, but may be a thousand times greater than the permeability of space, which is unity.    Permanent magnet materials are designed to offer as many pinning sites for the domain walls as possible. Once magnetized, the domain walls cannot move and the magnetization persists. Alnico V, 8 Al, 14 Ni, 24 Co, 3 Cu, with the remainder iron, is a traditional permanent magnet material. It has a saturation flux density of 12,500 gauss and a coercive force of 550 oersted. Neodymium Iron Boron and Samarium Cobalt are modern sintered materials with excellent properties, except that they cannot stand high temperatures. Sintered magnets can easily be made in odd shapes.    ""Soft"" magnetic materials, where the domain walls can move easily, ideally make the magnetization a single-valued function of the magnetizing field, so that there is no hysteresis loss when the field reverses repeatedly. These materials are required for transformers and rotating machines. Crystals of pure iron have few pinning sites, so pure iron is magnetically ""soft."" Pure iron has a saturation flux density of 21,500 gauss and a coercive force of 0.05 oersted. Its maximum permeability is 180,000. Other alloys are designed to have as large a permeability as possible, so that only a small magnetizing field will saturate them. ""Mu-metal,"" 18 Fe, 75 Ni, 2 Cr, 5 Cu, has a saturation flux density of 6,500 gauss, a coercive force of 0.05 oersted, and a maximum permeability of 100,000. It is used for magnetic shielding. ""Supermalloy,"" 15.7 Fe, 79 Ni, 5 Mo, 0.3 Mn, has a saturation flux density of 8,000 gauss, a coercive force of 0.002 oersted, and a maximum permeability of 800,000.    Silicon iron as a magnetic material was developed by Sir Robert Hadfield in England, and was introduced to the United States by the Allegheny Steel Company in 1903. As silicon is added, the iron becomes a better and better magnetic material as its electrical resistivity increases, but it also becomes brittle and difficult to work. At 4.25% silicon, its resistivity is about 60 μΩ-cm, more than 7 times that of pure iron, without impairment of its magnetic qualities. The aim is to produce a steel with the lowest total core loss, eddy currents plus hysteresis. The ultimate strength of this iron is 97.9 ksi, with 5% elongation in the tensile test. At 3.25%, the elongation is still 29%, so this last percent of silicon comes at a price. The saturation flux density of the 4.25% steel is 19,700 gauss. The remanent flux density from 10,000 gauss is 8100 gauss, and the coercive force 0.4 oersted. The maximum permeability is about 7600. This represents an average working condition for the steel used in transformers. Allegheny Steel Company introduced mumetal in 1934. Silicon steel is much less expensive than the exotic alloys.    To reduce eddy current losses, magnetic cores are made of thin laminations, insulated from each other. The currents would flow normal to the laminations, so their paths are made to be of high resistance by this means. Eddy currents are, of course, just the currents that flow in conducting materials as the result of electric fields created by changing magnetic fields, according to Faraday's Law. For direct current excitation, there are no eddy currents. Transformer steel is furnished in thin sheets, from which the laminations are punched, and then assembled to form the magnetic cores.      Iron and Blood    Living cells oxidize glucose with atmospheric oxygen, and release carbon dioxide as a result. A cell bathed in water can easily dispose of the carbon dioxide, since it diffuses through the cell wall to the water in which it is very soluble, 1800 cc per litre of water. Oxygen diffuses into the cell from the water where it dissolves to the extent of 50 cc per litre. This is a small, but sufficient concentration. More oxygen would probably be deleterious. A small cell is a colloid, dominated by surface area, not volume. A cell must be small for this strategy to be successful, so most cells and simple organisms are microscopic.    When cells associate in a multicellular organism, the support of respiration by provision of oxygen and carrying-away of carbon dioxide must be arranged. Coelenterata, with an inside and an outside and specialized cells, set up a flow of water through their body that brings in oxygen, and nutrients, with the fresh water, and discharges carbon dioxide and other waste product with the efflux.    More complex organisms, such as ourselves, consist of a large assembly of cells that must respire, though out of water and packed tightly against each other. To supply oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide, a  circulatory system  is required where a fluid transports the substances between the working cells and organs that communicate with the atmosphere, the lungs. In the atmosphere, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is very low (0.3 torr), and the partial pressure of oxygen is high, 152 torr. If water is circulated, the soluble carbon dioxide would be transferred very well, since it would dissolve easily near the cell, and would evaporate easily when a thin layer were exposed to the air. Oxygen, however, is a different story. Because of its low solubility, an insufficient amount would dissolve across the limited lung area to supply all the cells, who would require an absorbing area equal to their total surface area. Some vehicle is necessary that would absorb oxygen in the required amount in the lungs, and then when carried to the cells, would release it for their use. This is not a simple matter. Something that absorbed oxygen in the lungs would hold on to it at the other end as well. It is necessary to make the vehicle hungry for oxygen in the lungs, and disgusted with it in the tissues, to transport sufficient oxygen for the hosts of cells in the body.    A very intricate and wonderful mechanism has evolved to handle this job. It involves a protein,  globin , and a  prosthetic group ,  heme . A protein is a chain of amino acids linked by peptide groups that folds intricately in the presence of water to carry out a chemical task, using its ensemble of amino acid side chains and its structure to that end. The purpose of globin is to hold and manage heme groups that are the actual oxygen carriers. A simple globin is  myoglobin , in which the ingenious mechanism of the heme group is used to store oxygen in muscles, for instant release when needed. The transporter is  hemoglobin , which consists of four myoglobin-like units carefully arranged and mechanically connected. This protein is  allosteric , meaning that changes occurring at one point in the molecule have effects at distant points.    The purpose of the allosterism is to make binding of one oxygen at one of the four heme groups  help  the bonding of additional oxygen at the other heme groups. Oxygen bonds to hemoglobin  cooperatively . This mechanism works in reverse when the oxygen is released. Hemoglobin with oxygen bound to its four heme groups is  oxyhemoglobin , and without oxygen, it is  deoxyhemoglobin . Hemoglobin not only carries oxygen, but also carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion, H + , so it responds to the pH of its environment and the CO 2  concentration as well as to the partial pressure of oxygen.    In the lungs, the partial pressure of oxygen is high, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is low, and the pH is relatively alkaline. All these factors encourage deoxyhemoglobin to become oxyhemoglobin. The hemoglobin is contained in erythrocytes, red blood cells, that communicate readily through their cell walls with the blood plasma. They are in constant circulation through the body, reaching the most distant cells. Activity of a cell, especially muscle cells that are hungry for oxygen, produces carbon dioxide and acids, such as lactic acid, which make the pH acidic. The hemoglobin adds CO 2  and responds to the increased acidity and low partial pressure of oxygen by actively dumping its oxygen. The release of one oxygen makes the release of the others easier, and the oxygen pressure in the region is restored, so oxygen diffuses to all the cells in the vicinity. The whole procedure is quite automatic, and generally works very well indeed. The sensitivity of hemoglobin to CO 2  and H +  is called the  Bohr effect , after Christian Bohr, who discovered it in 1904.    Free hemoglobin does not have these properties; its oxygen affinity is like that of myoglobin. Within an erythrocyte, it is provided with BPG, 2,3 biphosphoglycerate, which lowers the partial pressure of oxygen at which half the hemoglobin is oxyhemoglobin from 1 torr to 26 torr. This means that a lowering of the oxygen partial pressure to 26 torr will release half the oxygen from oxyhemoglobin, so the cells will not have to gasp for air. The effect of BPG was discovered by Reinhold and Ruth Benesch in 1967. Fetal hemoglobin, hemoglobin F, has a higher oxygen affinity than hemoglobin A. This enables the fetus to receive oxygen across the placenta. At birth, it is replaced by hemoglobin A for normal respiration through the lungs. Hemoglobin F has less affinity for BPG, and so more affinity for oxygen, than hemoglobin A.     A very wonderful thing is that all of this is now understood in detail, even the mechanism of the Bohr effect, since the structure of proteins can be worked out by X-ray scattering. John Kendrew worked out myoglobin in 1957, and Max Perutz hemoglobin in 1959, after 23 years of effort. Myoglobin is 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 nm and contains about 141 amino acids and one heme group. Hemoglobin is about 5.5 nm in diameter, and contains about 574 amino acids. The methods of protein synthesis are now known as well. An enzyme travels down a DNA double helix and makes a single-strand messenger RNA. Another enzyme starts like a zipper at one end, and travels down the mRNA, making a protein as it goes like a strip from a labeling machine. This protein then curls up, grabbing a heme group, and associates with three others to make hemoglobin. This takes place in bone marrow. There are several different kinds of chains, which make a variety of hemoglobins. The predominant adult human hemoglobin is hemoglobin A. Errors in the DNA that make defective protein chains cause recognizable diseases, like sickle-cell anemia, when the hemoglobin does not function as intended.     The structure of heme is shown at the right. The ferrous ion is at the center, and is the active ingredient. Only ferrohemoglobin can bind oxygen; ferrihemoglobin cannot. The double bonds give rigidity, since there is no free rotation about them. The central part, formed of four pyrrole rings with the nitrogens holding the iron loosely, is a rigid disc. Each of the side chains can rotate about a single bond, and have rigid ""hooks"" that can lock them into the globin that holds the heme. Oxyhemoglobin is transparent to light of wavelength greater than 580 nm, so it appears bright red, while deoxyhemoglobin absorbs a little in this band, appearing darker red. Both absorb strongly everything of less than 580 nanometer wavelength.     When the globin winds around the heme, it places a histidine next to the iron on one side that bonds to it. The amino acid histidine is shown at the right. An H has come off the COOH carboxyl group typical of an organic acid and attached itself to the N, as usually occurs in solution. This end is part of the globin chain. On the other side there is a second histidine, but it does not bond to the iron. When the iron moves in and out slightly from its position, the motion is transmitted to the histidine bound to it, which moves a section of the protein that interacts with the other proteins of the hemoglobin to make the bonding of oxygen more or less favorable. This is the mechanism of the allosteric effect. The iron ion is a little on the bound histidine side of the heme disc in dexoyhemoglobin. When it bonds to an O 2  molecule, it moves into the plane, producing the allosteric effect. The axis of the oxygen molecule is at an angle (it binds to one of the lone-pair electrons of the oxygen). This is shown in the diagram to the right.     The iron also bonds strongly to CO, and prefers to be end-on, where all the electrons are. The body has an internal problem with CO, since it is formed by the recycling of heme at the end of the 120-day life span of an erythrocyte. There is enough CO formed to block all the hemoglobin in the blood after a while, so something must be done. The other histidine, the one not bound to the oxygen, stands just above the iron ion, and will not allow CO to bind end-on, but forces it to the side. This reduces the problem enough that only about 1% of the hemoglobin is blocked by endogenic CO. Oxygen normally binds at an angle, so the histidine does not bother it. Once CO has bonded with hemoglobin, it is very difficult to pry it off. Fortunately, few other molecules will bind to the heme.    A heme group is also present in  cytochromes , proteins which transfer electrons to O 2  in metabolism, converting them to H 2 O as one of the end products of oxidizing food. This heme is slightly different than that in hemoglobin.  Cytochrome oxidase , the enzyme catalyzing this reaction, also contains a heme, called heme A.    Chlorophyll has a structure very similar to heme, except that the metal held by the four nitrogens is magnesium, and one of the attached chains is rather long. This molecule absorbs in the blue and red, so is green by transmitted light, the familiar green of photosynthetic plants. It is located in small bodies called  chloroplasts , relics of once-independent cells, where it absorbs the energy of light to supply the energy necessary for making carbohydrates out of carbon dioxide and water, supporting all the life on earth.    Another similar molecule is vitamin B12 or  cobalamin , in which the heme-like molecule  corrin  binds a cobalt atom with the four nitrogens. This is the business site of coenzyme B12, which is necessary in purine synthesis and other duties. In coenzyme B12, one of the cobalt bonds is directly to a carbon, the only example of a carbon-metal bond in all biochemistry. Cobalamin can be synthesized only by microorganisms, typically anaerobic bacteria. It must be obtained in the diet, or from intestinal bacteria. Only about 10 μg/day is required by a human. It is so widely available that a deficiency is rare. The body takes special care to make chemicals that aid its absorption in the small intestine. If these chemicals are lacking, the result is serious  pernicious anemia , from the resulting scarcity of coenzyme B12. The cobalt atom can be in a +1, +2 or +3 oxidation state, and all are important in the actions of vitamin B12. The cobalt in cobalamin is successively reduced to +2 and then +1, when it combines with ATP to form 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, which is the coenzyme B12 essential for cell chemistry.     Iron also appears in the  iron-sulphur proteins  which are essential to aerobic life. The enzyme  aconitase  occurs in the citric acid cycle that oxidizes carbon to CO 2  in mitochondria, rearranging the citrate to isocitrate at the beginning of the cycle so it can be further processed. The prosthetic group in aconitase is the iron-sulphur group shown in the diagram at the left, composed of interpenetrating iron and sulphur tetrahedra. It is bound tetrahedrally to four cysteine residues in the enzyme. Iron-sulphur proteins also play a role in nitrogen fixation.      Iron and cobalt, therefore, are essential to life, and especially for animals with red blood. It is curious that molybdenum is also essential for the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by bacteria, since it plays a role in a necessary protein. This protein is an enzyme converting N 2  to NH 4 + . Very little is required, but it is required. Such trace nutrients need not be supplied in any quantity greater than the need, and are usually amply available to plants and animals in their normal surroundings. The ""supplements"" filling the shelves in health stores and supermarkets are surplus to requirements and totally useless, the result of a combination of ignorance of nutrition with thirst for money. In fact, too much of a trace nutrient, especially metals, may be toxic. Some nonmetals, such as iodine to support thyroid function, fluorine to strengthen tooth enamel, or boron for plant growth are necessary in small amounts, but in larger amounts are also toxic. Unlike the trace metals, they may actually be deficient in the environment, and require supplementation. Iron, of course, is more than a trace nutrient, but is effectively recycled by the body and only needs to be topped up.    References    C. Kittel,  Introduction to Solid State Physics , 2nd ed.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidizes readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes   Main article:  Allotropes of iron   Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallizes at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.

Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth.

Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy          The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore   See also:  Iron ore          Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace   Main article:  Blast furnace          Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes   Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks   Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content, the higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes   Main article:  Isotopes of iron   Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b       Main article:  Human iron metabolism   Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption, high blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.
