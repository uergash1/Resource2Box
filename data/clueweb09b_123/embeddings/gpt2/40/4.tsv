Weatherstrips vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Weatherstripping on older cars can be a bit more complicated than newer cars.  Below is a list of common weatherstrip terminology and where they fit.        Door Seals:  There are 2 basic types of door seals, sedan or coupe door seals, and hardtop or convertible seals.   Sedan Door Seals:  Sedan door seals usually attach to the door, or sometimes the door opening, following along the whole perimeter of the door.  If your car is a sedan it will have a metal frame all the way around the side window glass.   Hardtop & Convertible Door Seals:  Unlike a sedan, hardtop and convertible cars do not have a metal frame going all the way around the side glass.  Hardtop and convertible door seals attach to the doors and run along the sides and bottom edges of the door.   Roof Rail Seals:  Roof Rail seals are used only on hardtop and convertible models.   Hardtop Roof Rail Seals: On a hardtop car the roof rail seals run up the windshield pillar, along the roofline all the way down to the bottom side of the front or quarter side window.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Convertible Roof Rail Seals:  Convertible roof rail seals are also called convertible top seals.  Convertible top roof rail seals usually come in multiple pieces and attach to the sides of the convertible top frame.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Windshield Pillar Seals:  Windshield pillar seals are usually only found on some pre 1958 cars, almost all convertible models, and some Corvettes.  The windshield pillar seals attach to the windshield pillar and seal either the vent window glass frame, or front of the side glass to the windshield pillar.   Windshield Header Seal:  Windshield or Convertible top header seals are only found on convertible cars, or Targa top Corvette Coupes.  The windshield header seal usually attaches to the front edge of the convertible top frame and seals the front of the convertible top to the top of the windshield frame.   Window Sweeps:  Window Sweeps are also often called window felts, window seals, window whiskers, or Belt seals.  Window sweeps attach on the outside to the top of the door and or quarter panel, and on the inside to the top edge of the interior door panel.  The window sweeps sweep against the glass when the windows are rolled up or down, and help prevent water and debris from getting into the door and or quarter panel.   Hood to Cowl Seal:  The hood to cowl seal attaches to the top of the firewall cowl, and seals the back edge of the hood to the cowl when closed.   Trunk Seal and Rear Hatch Seals:   Trunk seals attach to the body of the car and seal the trunk lid to the body.  On a hatchback car the rear hatch seal also usually attaches to the body of the car and seals the rear hatch when closed.        These are just some of the different types of common weatherstrips 1A Auto offers.  If you have any weatherstriping questions please contact our customer service toll free at 888-844-3393.       return to top    Tips on how to replace a Weatherstrip:     Understand how your Weatherstripping attaches.    Take pictures of the original weatherstrips before you begin.  If necessary, these pictures can be a valuable resource after attaching the weatherstrips, while reassembling your vehicle.   Weatherstrips will usually attach with screws, Nylon, or plastic clips, Weatherstrip adhesive, or any combination of the above.   Replace 1 side at a time.  Most weatherstrips are replaced in pairs.  Replacing one weatherstrip at a time allows you to check how the original was attached, providing a valuable reference.   With any weatherstrips that attach using adhesive, take the time to ensure all of the old adhesive has been removed.  This step ensures a good bond between your car and the new weatherstripping.   Choose an appropriate work area and have patience.   Make sure you have a large protected space to work in.   Don't let yourself be rushed by the weather.   Allow yourself plenty of time.   A quality weatherstrip replacement can be a day long project depending on the amount of weatherstripping replaced.   Think it through. Don't rush yourself by starting the project at night if you need the car the following morning.      return to top                  Get the 1A Auto Car & Truck Weatherstrip Advantage                 Factory trained technicians available to help you choose the correct weatherstripping for your car or truck Our high quality weatherstrip is molded with 50 tons of pressure providing precise definition and detail to insure the best possible seal All weatherstripping orders are subject to our ""No Hassle"" return policy Secure Online Ordering Speed! 98% of weatherstrip orders leave our warehouse within 24 hours (1 business day) Free Ground Shipping (USA Only) on Weatherstrip!                                                                                                                                                                                                  1A Auto gets you the right parts                   Secure Personal Information                   Highest Quality Parts                   In-Stock Status                   No Hassle return policy                   1A Auto saves you money                   Fast Shipping                                                                                                                                         Can't find the auto parts you're looking for?

Weatherstrips vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Weatherstripping on older cars can be a bit more complicated than newer cars.  Below is a list of common weatherstrip terminology and where they fit.        Door Seals:  There are 2 basic types of door seals, sedan or coupe door seals, and hardtop or convertible seals.   Sedan Door Seals:  Sedan door seals usually attach to the door, or sometimes the door opening, following along the whole perimeter of the door.  If your car is a sedan it will have a metal frame all the way around the side window glass.   Hardtop & Convertible Door Seals:  Unlike a sedan, hardtop and convertible cars do not have a metal frame going all the way around the side glass.  Hardtop and convertible door seals attach to the doors and run along the sides and bottom edges of the door.   Roof Rail Seals:  Roof Rail seals are used only on hardtop and convertible models.   Hardtop Roof Rail Seals: On a hardtop car the roof rail seals run up the windshield pillar, along the roofline all the way down to the bottom side of the front or quarter side window.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Convertible Roof Rail Seals:  Convertible roof rail seals are also called convertible top seals.  Convertible top roof rail seals usually come in multiple pieces and attach to the sides of the convertible top frame.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Windshield Pillar Seals:  Windshield pillar seals are usually only found on some pre 1958 cars, almost all convertible models, and some Corvettes.  The windshield pillar seals attach to the windshield pillar and seal either the vent window glass frame, or front of the side glass to the windshield pillar.   Windshield Header Seal:  Windshield or Convertible top header seals are only found on convertible cars, or Targa top Corvette Coupes.  The windshield header seal usually attaches to the front edge of the convertible top frame and seals the front of the convertible top to the top of the windshield frame.   Window Sweeps:  Window Sweeps are also often called window felts, window seals, window whiskers, or Belt seals.  Window sweeps attach on the outside to the top of the door and or quarter panel, and on the inside to the top edge of the interior door panel.  The window sweeps sweep against the glass when the windows are rolled up or down, and help prevent water and debris from getting into the door and or quarter panel.   Hood to Cowl Seal:  The hood to cowl seal attaches to the top of the firewall cowl, and seals the back edge of the hood to the cowl when closed.   Trunk Seal and Rear Hatch Seals:   Trunk seals attach to the body of the car and seal the trunk lid to the body.  On a hatchback car the rear hatch seal also usually attaches to the body of the car and seals the rear hatch when closed.        These are just some of the different types of common weatherstrips 1A Auto offers.  If you have any weatherstriping questions please contact our customer service toll free at 888-844-3393.       return to top    Tips on how to replace a Weatherstrip:     Understand how your Weatherstripping attaches.    Take pictures of the original weatherstrips before you begin.  If necessary, these pictures can be a valuable resource after attaching the weatherstrips, while reassembling your vehicle.   Weatherstrips will usually attach with screws, Nylon, or plastic clips, Weatherstrip adhesive, or any combination of the above.   Replace 1 side at a time.  Most weatherstrips are replaced in pairs.  Replacing one weatherstrip at a time allows you to check how the original was attached, providing a valuable reference.   With any weatherstrips that attach using adhesive, take the time to ensure all of the old adhesive has been removed.  This step ensures a good bond between your car and the new weatherstripping.   Choose an appropriate work area and have patience.   Make sure you have a large protected space to work in.   Don't let yourself be rushed by the weather.   Allow yourself plenty of time.   A quality weatherstrip replacement can be a day long project depending on the amount of weatherstripping replaced.   Think it through. Don't rush yourself by starting the project at night if you need the car the following morning.      return to top                  Get the 1A Auto Car & Truck Weatherstrip Advantage                 Factory trained technicians available to help you choose the correct weatherstripping for your car or truck Our high quality weatherstrip is molded with 50 tons of pressure providing precise definition and detail to insure the best possible seal All weatherstripping orders are subject to our ""No Hassle"" return policy Secure Online Ordering Speed! 98% of weatherstrip orders leave our warehouse within 24 hours (1 business day) Free Ground Shipping (USA Only) on Weatherstrip!                                                                                                                                                                                                  1A Auto gets you the right parts                   Secure Personal Information                   Highest Quality Parts                   In-Stock Status                   No Hassle return policy                   1A Auto saves you money                   Fast Shipping                                                                                                                                         Can't find the auto parts you're looking for?

Weatherstrips vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Weatherstripping on older cars can be a bit more complicated than newer cars.  Below is a list of common weatherstrip terminology and where they fit.        Door Seals:  There are 2 basic types of door seals, sedan or coupe door seals, and hardtop or convertible seals.   Sedan Door Seals:  Sedan door seals usually attach to the door, or sometimes the door opening, following along the whole perimeter of the door.  If your car is a sedan it will have a metal frame all the way around the side window glass.   Hardtop & Convertible Door Seals:  Unlike a sedan, hardtop and convertible cars do not have a metal frame going all the way around the side glass.  Hardtop and convertible door seals attach to the doors and run along the sides and bottom edges of the door.   Roof Rail Seals:  Roof Rail seals are used only on hardtop and convertible models.   Hardtop Roof Rail Seals: On a hardtop car the roof rail seals run up the windshield pillar, along the roofline all the way down to the bottom side of the front or quarter side window.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Convertible Roof Rail Seals:  Convertible roof rail seals are also called convertible top seals.  Convertible top roof rail seals usually come in multiple pieces and attach to the sides of the convertible top frame.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Windshield Pillar Seals:  Windshield pillar seals are usually only found on some pre 1958 cars, almost all convertible models, and some Corvettes.  The windshield pillar seals attach to the windshield pillar and seal either the vent window glass frame, or front of the side glass to the windshield pillar.   Windshield Header Seal:  Windshield or Convertible top header seals are only found on convertible cars, or Targa top Corvette Coupes.  The windshield header seal usually attaches to the front edge of the convertible top frame and seals the front of the convertible top to the top of the windshield frame.   Window Sweeps:  Window Sweeps are also often called window felts, window seals, window whiskers, or Belt seals.  Window sweeps attach on the outside to the top of the door and or quarter panel, and on the inside to the top edge of the interior door panel.  The window sweeps sweep against the glass when the windows are rolled up or down, and help prevent water and debris from getting into the door and or quarter panel.   Hood to Cowl Seal:  The hood to cowl seal attaches to the top of the firewall cowl, and seals the back edge of the hood to the cowl when closed.   Trunk Seal and Rear Hatch Seals:   Trunk seals attach to the body of the car and seal the trunk lid to the body.  On a hatchback car the rear hatch seal also usually attaches to the body of the car and seals the rear hatch when closed.        These are just some of the different types of common weatherstrips 1A Auto offers.  If you have any weatherstriping questions please contact our customer service toll free at 888-844-3393.       return to top    Tips on how to replace a Weatherstrip:     Understand how your Weatherstripping attaches.    Take pictures of the original weatherstrips before you begin.  If necessary, these pictures can be a valuable resource after attaching the weatherstrips, while reassembling your vehicle.   Weatherstrips will usually attach with screws, Nylon, or plastic clips, Weatherstrip adhesive, or any combination of the above.   Replace 1 side at a time.  Most weatherstrips are replaced in pairs.  Replacing one weatherstrip at a time allows you to check how the original was attached, providing a valuable reference.   With any weatherstrips that attach using adhesive, take the time to ensure all of the old adhesive has been removed.  This step ensures a good bond between your car and the new weatherstripping.   Choose an appropriate work area and have patience.   Make sure you have a large protected space to work in.   Don't let yourself be rushed by the weather.   Allow yourself plenty of time.   A quality weatherstrip replacement can be a day long project depending on the amount of weatherstripping replaced.   Think it through. Don't rush yourself by starting the project at night if you need the car the following morning.      return to top                  Get the 1A Auto Car & Truck Weatherstrip Advantage                 Factory trained technicians available to help you choose the correct weatherstripping for your car or truck Our high quality weatherstrip is molded with 50 tons of pressure providing precise definition and detail to insure the best possible seal All weatherstripping orders are subject to our ""No Hassle"" return policy Secure Online Ordering Speed! 98% of weatherstrip orders leave our warehouse within 24 hours (1 business day) Free Ground Shipping (USA Only) on Weatherstrip!                                                                                                                                                                                                  1A Auto gets you the right parts                   Secure Personal Information                   Highest Quality Parts                   In-Stock Status                   No Hassle return policy                   1A Auto saves you money                   Fast Shipping                                                                                                                                         Can't find the auto parts you're looking for?

Weatherstrips vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Weatherstripping on older cars can be a bit more complicated than newer cars.  Below is a list of common weatherstrip terminology and where they fit.        Door Seals:  There are 2 basic types of door seals, sedan or coupe door seals, and hardtop or convertible seals.   Sedan Door Seals:  Sedan door seals usually attach to the door, or sometimes the door opening, following along the whole perimeter of the door.  If your car is a sedan it will have a metal frame all the way around the side window glass.   Hardtop & Convertible Door Seals:  Unlike a sedan, hardtop and convertible cars do not have a metal frame going all the way around the side glass.  Hardtop and convertible door seals attach to the doors and run along the sides and bottom edges of the door.   Roof Rail Seals:  Roof Rail seals are used only on hardtop and convertible models.   Hardtop Roof Rail Seals: On a hardtop car the roof rail seals run up the windshield pillar, along the roofline all the way down to the bottom side of the front or quarter side window.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Convertible Roof Rail Seals:  Convertible roof rail seals are also called convertible top seals.  Convertible top roof rail seals usually come in multiple pieces and attach to the sides of the convertible top frame.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Windshield Pillar Seals:  Windshield pillar seals are usually only found on some pre 1958 cars, almost all convertible models, and some Corvettes.  The windshield pillar seals attach to the windshield pillar and seal either the vent window glass frame, or front of the side glass to the windshield pillar.   Windshield Header Seal:  Windshield or Convertible top header seals are only found on convertible cars, or Targa top Corvette Coupes.  The windshield header seal usually attaches to the front edge of the convertible top frame and seals the front of the convertible top to the top of the windshield frame.   Window Sweeps:  Window Sweeps are also often called window felts, window seals, window whiskers, or Belt seals.  Window sweeps attach on the outside to the top of the door and or quarter panel, and on the inside to the top edge of the interior door panel.  The window sweeps sweep against the glass when the windows are rolled up or down, and help prevent water and debris from getting into the door and or quarter panel.   Hood to Cowl Seal:  The hood to cowl seal attaches to the top of the firewall cowl, and seals the back edge of the hood to the cowl when closed.   Trunk Seal and Rear Hatch Seals:   Trunk seals attach to the body of the car and seal the trunk lid to the body.  On a hatchback car the rear hatch seal also usually attaches to the body of the car and seals the rear hatch when closed.        These are just some of the different types of common weatherstrips 1A Auto offers.  If you have any weatherstriping questions please contact our customer service toll free at 888-844-3393.       return to top    Tips on how to replace a Weatherstrip:     Understand how your Weatherstripping attaches.    Take pictures of the original weatherstrips before you begin.  If necessary, these pictures can be a valuable resource after attaching the weatherstrips, while reassembling your vehicle.   Weatherstrips will usually attach with screws, Nylon, or plastic clips, Weatherstrip adhesive, or any combination of the above.   Replace 1 side at a time.  Most weatherstrips are replaced in pairs.  Replacing one weatherstrip at a time allows you to check how the original was attached, providing a valuable reference.   With any weatherstrips that attach using adhesive, take the time to ensure all of the old adhesive has been removed.  This step ensures a good bond between your car and the new weatherstripping.   Choose an appropriate work area and have patience.   Make sure you have a large protected space to work in.   Don't let yourself be rushed by the weather.   Allow yourself plenty of time.   A quality weatherstrip replacement can be a day long project depending on the amount of weatherstripping replaced.   Think it through. Don't rush yourself by starting the project at night if you need the car the following morning.      return to top                  Get the 1A Auto Car & Truck Weatherstrip Advantage                 Factory trained technicians available to help you choose the correct weatherstripping for your car or truck Our high quality weatherstrip is molded with 50 tons of pressure providing precise definition and detail to insure the best possible seal All weatherstripping orders are subject to our ""No Hassle"" return policy Secure Online Ordering Speed! 98% of weatherstrip orders leave our warehouse within 24 hours (1 business day) Free Ground Shipping (USA Only) on Weatherstrip!                                                                                                                                                                                                  1A Auto gets you the right parts                   Secure Personal Information                   Highest Quality Parts                   In-Stock Status                   No Hassle return policy                   1A Auto saves you money                   Fast Shipping                                                                                                                                         Can't find the auto parts you're looking for?

Weatherstrips vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Weatherstripping on older cars can be a bit more complicated than newer cars.  Below is a list of common weatherstrip terminology and where they fit.        Door Seals:  There are 2 basic types of door seals, sedan or coupe door seals, and hardtop or convertible seals.   Sedan Door Seals:  Sedan door seals usually attach to the door, or sometimes the door opening, following along the whole perimeter of the door.  If your car is a sedan it will have a metal frame all the way around the side window glass.   Hardtop & Convertible Door Seals:  Unlike a sedan, hardtop and convertible cars do not have a metal frame going all the way around the side glass.  Hardtop and convertible door seals attach to the doors and run along the sides and bottom edges of the door.   Roof Rail Seals:  Roof Rail seals are used only on hardtop and convertible models.   Hardtop Roof Rail Seals: On a hardtop car the roof rail seals run up the windshield pillar, along the roofline all the way down to the bottom side of the front or quarter side window.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Convertible Roof Rail Seals:  Convertible roof rail seals are also called convertible top seals.  Convertible top roof rail seals usually come in multiple pieces and attach to the sides of the convertible top frame.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Windshield Pillar Seals:  Windshield pillar seals are usually only found on some pre 1958 cars, almost all convertible models, and some Corvettes.  The windshield pillar seals attach to the windshield pillar and seal either the vent window glass frame, or front of the side glass to the windshield pillar.   Windshield Header Seal:  Windshield or Convertible top header seals are only found on convertible cars, or Targa top Corvette Coupes.  The windshield header seal usually attaches to the front edge of the convertible top frame and seals the front of the convertible top to the top of the windshield frame.   Window Sweeps:  Window Sweeps are also often called window felts, window seals, window whiskers, or Belt seals.  Window sweeps attach on the outside to the top of the door and or quarter panel, and on the inside to the top edge of the interior door panel.  The window sweeps sweep against the glass when the windows are rolled up or down, and help prevent water and debris from getting into the door and or quarter panel.   Hood to Cowl Seal:  The hood to cowl seal attaches to the top of the firewall cowl, and seals the back edge of the hood to the cowl when closed.   Trunk Seal and Rear Hatch Seals:   Trunk seals attach to the body of the car and seal the trunk lid to the body.  On a hatchback car the rear hatch seal also usually attaches to the body of the car and seals the rear hatch when closed.        These are just some of the different types of common weatherstrips 1A Auto offers.  If you have any weatherstriping questions please contact our customer service toll free at 888-844-3393.       return to top    Tips on how to replace a Weatherstrip:     Understand how your Weatherstripping attaches.    Take pictures of the original weatherstrips before you begin.  If necessary, these pictures can be a valuable resource after attaching the weatherstrips, while reassembling your vehicle.   Weatherstrips will usually attach with screws, Nylon, or plastic clips, Weatherstrip adhesive, or any combination of the above.   Replace 1 side at a time.  Most weatherstrips are replaced in pairs.  Replacing one weatherstrip at a time allows you to check how the original was attached, providing a valuable reference.   With any weatherstrips that attach using adhesive, take the time to ensure all of the old adhesive has been removed.  This step ensures a good bond between your car and the new weatherstripping.   Choose an appropriate work area and have patience.   Make sure you have a large protected space to work in.   Don't let yourself be rushed by the weather.   Allow yourself plenty of time.   A quality weatherstrip replacement can be a day long project depending on the amount of weatherstripping replaced.   Think it through. Don't rush yourself by starting the project at night if you need the car the following morning.      return to top                 Get the 1A Auto Car & Truck Weatherstrip Advantage                 Factory trained technicians available to help you choose the correct weatherstripping for your car or truck Our high quality weatherstrip is molded with 50 tons of pressure providing precise definition and detail to insure the best possible seal All weatherstripping orders are subject to our ""No Hassle"" return policy Secure Online Ordering Speed! 98% of weatherstrip orders leave our warehouse within 24 hours (1 business day) Free Ground Shipping (USA Only) on Weatherstrip!                                                                                                                                                                                                   1A Auto gets you the right parts                   Secure Personal Information                   Highest Quality Parts                   In-Stock Status                   No Hassle return policy                   1A Auto saves you money                   Fast Shipping                                                                                                                                         Can't find the auto parts you're looking for?

Weatherstrips vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Weatherstripping on older cars can be a bit more complicated than newer cars.  Below is a list of common weatherstrip terminology and where they fit.        Door Seals:  There are 2 basic types of door seals, sedan or coupe door seals, and hardtop or convertible seals.   Sedan Door Seals:  Sedan door seals usually attach to the door, or sometimes the door opening, following along the whole perimeter of the door.  If your car is a sedan it will have a metal frame all the way around the side window glass.   Hardtop & Convertible Door Seals:  Unlike a sedan, hardtop and convertible cars do not have a metal frame going all the way around the side glass.  Hardtop and convertible door seals attach to the doors and run along the sides and bottom edges of the door.   Roof Rail Seals:  Roof Rail seals are used only on hardtop and convertible models.   Hardtop Roof Rail Seals: On a hardtop car the roof rail seals run up the windshield pillar, along the roofline all the way down to the bottom side of the front or quarter side window.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Convertible Roof Rail Seals:  Convertible roof rail seals are also called convertible top seals.  Convertible top roof rail seals usually come in multiple pieces and attach to the sides of the convertible top frame.  These weatherstrips seal the top of the side windows when they are rolled all the way up.   Windshield Pillar Seals:  Windshield pillar seals are usually only found on some pre 1958 cars, almost all convertible models, and some Corvettes.  The windshield pillar seals attach to the windshield pillar and seal either the vent window glass frame, or front of the side glass to the windshield pillar.   Windshield Header Seal:  Windshield or Convertible top header seals are only found on convertible cars, or Targa top Corvette Coupes.  The windshield header seal usually attaches to the front edge of the convertible top frame and seals the front of the convertible top to the top of the windshield frame.   Window Sweeps:  Window Sweeps are also often called window felts, window seals, window whiskers, or Belt seals.  Window sweeps attach on the outside to the top of the door and or quarter panel, and on the inside to the top edge of the interior door panel.  The window sweeps sweep against the glass when the windows are rolled up or down, and help prevent water and debris from getting into the door and or quarter panel.   Hood to Cowl Seal:  The hood to cowl seal attaches to the top of the firewall cowl, and seals the back edge of the hood to the cowl when closed.   Trunk Seal and Rear Hatch Seals:   Trunk seals attach to the body of the car and seal the trunk lid to the body.  On a hatchback car the rear hatch seal also usually attaches to the body of the car and seals the rear hatch when closed.        These are just some of the different types of common weatherstrips 1A Auto offers.  If you have any weatherstriping questions please contact our customer service toll free at 888-844-3393.       return to top    Tips on how to replace a Weatherstrip:     Understand how your Weatherstripping attaches.    Take pictures of the original weatherstrips before you begin.  If necessary, these pictures can be a valuable resource after attaching the weatherstrips, while reassembling your vehicle.   Weatherstrips will usually attach with screws, Nylon, or plastic clips, Weatherstrip adhesive, or any combination of the above.   Replace 1 side at a time.  Most weatherstrips are replaced in pairs.  Replacing one weatherstrip at a time allows you to check how the original was attached, providing a valuable reference.   With any weatherstrips that attach using adhesive, take the time to ensure all of the old adhesive has been removed.  This step ensures a good bond between your car and the new weatherstripping.   Choose an appropriate work area and have patience.   Make sure you have a large protected space to work in.   Don't let yourself be rushed by the weather.   Allow yourself plenty of time.   A quality weatherstrip replacement can be a day long project depending on the amount of weatherstripping replaced.   Think it through. Don't rush yourself by starting the project at night if you need the car the following morning.      return to top                  Get the 1A Auto Car & Truck Weatherstrip Advantage                 Factory trained technicians available to help you choose the correct weatherstripping for your car or truck Our high quality weatherstrip is molded with 50 tons of pressure providing precise definition and detail to insure the best possible seal All weatherstripping orders are subject to our ""No Hassle"" return policy Secure Online Ordering Speed! 98% of weatherstrip orders leave our warehouse within 24 hours (1 business day) Free Ground Shipping (USA Only) on Weatherstrip!                                                                                                                                                                                                  1A Auto gets you the right parts                   Secure Personal Information                   Highest Quality Parts                   In-Stock Status                   No Hassle return policy                   1A Auto saves you money                   Fast Shipping                                                                                                                                         Can't find the auto parts you're looking for?

Photo archive of old MG sports & saloon cars.     MG must be up there with Jaguar and Rolls Royce in the best-known list of British car manufacturers, and has a global  following even today with classic and vintage car enthusiasts.    Before the war, Morris Garages produced a great variety of saloon and sporting cars, all of which are now eagerly  sought-after by collectors of pre-war automobiles. Although MG did produce low numbers of closed coupes before WW2, they are  perhaps best known for their very popular sportscars, many of which were modified for track use at the Brooklands  motor racing circuit. Club racing was also popular, and the MG range of cars lent itself ideally to this popular pursuit.    After the war MG continued producing stylish sporting motorcars, eventually being absorbed into the BMC empire when their  saloons became little more than re-worked and re-badged BMC saloons. Fortunately however their sportscars remained  MGs through and through, only sharing some chassis and mechanical parts with stodgy Austin and Morris cars from the  BMC stable.    The pre-war TC was developed after the war into the TD, and then the TF, by which time (the 1950s) they were getting  very long in the tooth. The MGA that came along after the TF was light years away in terms of styling, and brought the  sporting arm of MG Cars bang up to date.    Following the successful MGA came the MGB, which now is probably the most popular sporting car in preservation, certainly  in the UK. The MGB came out in 1962 and soldiered on, with only minor updates, to the seventies, when, thanks to US safety  legislation, the 'B' and Midget suffered the indignity of having the clumsy looking rubber bumpers nailed on fore & aft.    The rubber bumper Midget and MGB featured in BL's sales catalogue for a few more years, finally being pensioned off in the  early 1980s by which time they were looking very outdated. The B was never directly replaced, BL concentrating its 'sports car'  efforts on the Triumph TR7 instead. Throughout the 1980s the MG badge adorned the plastic grilles of several warmed-over  Austin Rover rustbucket saloons and hatchbacks, and did little to honour the famous badge.   In the nineties Rover produced a limited run of MG RV8 roadsters, to remind people that MG was more than a badged-up  Metro or Montego, prior to the launch of the 2 seater MGF range. The MGF brought MG back to people's attention, and in revised  MGTF form is still in production today, featuring it's novel mid-engine layout and, in some examples, trick variable valve timing.    Throughout the highs and lows of contemporary MG production, classic and vintage examples of this famous British marque  continued to be restored and coveted by enthusiasts across the world, leading to the creation of a large support industry  that makes running an old MG a fairly painless experience, at least when it comes to finding parts .. paying for them is a different  matter sometimes!!

Throughout the highs and lows of contemporary MG production, classic and vintage examples of this famous British marque  continued to be restored and coveted by enthusiasts across the world, leading to the creation of a large support industry  that makes running an old MG a fairly painless experience, at least when it comes to finding parts .. paying for them is a different  matter sometimes!!

Sports car design had moved up a gear, particularly in terms of comfort and the prospective sports car buyer was demanding more sophistication than the MGA was able to deliver. For MG's sake, the replacement needed to offer better performance and a greater degree of comfort. History has now shown that the new car did have these features, for it was the venerable MGB, a car which was to sell over five times the numbers of MGA.   Like the Austin-Healey Sprite and later the MG Midget, the MGB was to be of unitary construction which brought a number of advantages. The design of the body was such that the individual panels when welded together, produced box-like structures of immense strength.   The engine and transmission came directly from the MGA, but the b-series engine had been increased in capacity to 1789cc, which resulted in 94bhp, and a diaphragm clutch was used between the engine and transmission. As standard, the car was supplied with bolt-on steel disc wheels, similar to those of the MGA but of a slightly smaller diameter.   The MGB was extremely well received by the press who were fulsome in their praise of the new car, which was capable of exceeding 100mph without any fuss. Performance handling and economy were all of a high standard for the time, which resulted in a thoroughly reliable sports car that was a joy to drive. It found a ready market, particularly in the USA.             The MGB's Styling and Design      When the MGB was introduced in 1962, it was a two-seat open roadster with squared-off styling which was in the Midget mould, and was to endure. It had a pancake-style rear hinged bonnet, full width grille, scalloped recesses for the headlamps in the tops of the front wings, a separate boot with a hinged lid, and canted rear lights in the ends of the rear wings. The windscreen was a curved item, there was a removable soft-top, and the doors had wind-up windows with hinged quarterlights.  Aftermarket  gas charged props  have proved a popular upgrade for bonnet and boot hinges.   In the cockpit, driver and passenger had separate seats, and full instrumentation was provided, and a tonneau cover to cover the space behind the seats when the hood was down. Fortunately for owners now, there is the  wind blocker  to stop that wind  buffeting when the  MGB top  is down.  The MGB was a bit shorter than the MGA, but the design was such that MG had managed to make the cockpit roomier which allowed larger, more comfortable seats to be added.   A year later in 1963, among the options offered for the MGB were an overdrive for the transmission, centre-lock wire wheels, and a folding soft-top that could be stowed behind the seats. And in 1964 a much stronger bottom-end for the engine, derived from the BMC 1800, was fitted.   In the tradition of the earlier MG sports cars, the MGA had been built with a separate chassis to provide support and strength to the car, and to carry all the mechanical components and the body. By the end of the 1950's however, methods of car construction had moved on , and the days of the separate chassis were almost over. Unitary construction was now the name of the game, whereby a cleverly designed bodyshell constructed from a number of metal panels with a reinforced floorpan, provided mountings for all the mechanical components and absorbed all the loads from the suspension etc. The advantage of this type of construction was that it produced a much lighter car, which has obvious performance benefits for a sports car.   Hence, the MGB was to be built of unitary construction. At the front, the inner wing panels, front panel, and engine compartment bulkhead formed one box; the scuttle, bulkhead, and front floor formed another; while the rear inner wings, boot floor, and rear panels formed another. Box section strengthening pieces were added to the floor to stiffen it and provide mountings for the rear suspension, while additional box sections ran along the bottoms of the front inner wings for the engine and suspension mountings.   The front suspension and steering were much like the MGA, although there were minor differences. At the rear were the familiar semi-elliptic springs controlled by lever-arm dampers. The engine and transmission were also MGA sourced, again with some minor changes.             The MGB GT      In 1965 came a coupe version of the MGB - the MGB GT, which had an attractive and functional closed version of the standard body. In appearance, the front end, front and rear wings, and doors were essentially the same as the roadster, but the windscreen was slightly higher to allow for a higher roof line on the car. The roof ran back in a gentle curve over the doors and rear side windows before sloping down into the rear panel. In the place of the roadsters small boot lid was a much larger hinged tailgate that provided access to the loadspace inside, making it one of the earliest examples of the now popular hatchback car.   Inside, a small rear seat was provided but this was not much use except for carrying children. However, the seat could be folded flat to provide a large load platform for luggage, making the GT a really useful two-seat touring car. Although the coupe bodywork made the MGB much heavier, its shape actually helped the cars performance by the improvement in aerodynamics the roof brought. This gave the GT a slightly higher top speed than the roadster, and also an improvement in handling since the roof put more weight over rear end, but this weight had a detrimental effect on the cars acceleration.   The MGB GT was not only a good looking car, but it offered saloon car comfort levels with a sports cars performance. As a result, the GT became very popular with those who wanted something more civilised than a roadster.                      The MGB ""MkII""      Both models continued until 1967, when the MGB MkII was introduced, still in open and GT forms. The most significant difference was that the new model had a new transmission with synchromesh on all four gears, and a better set of ratios. This necessitated widening of the transmission tunnel, which also allowed MG to offer the option of automatic transmission, which may seem strange for a sports car but it was felt that new customers attracted by the GT would take to the idea.   Also in 1967 a new MG model was introduced. This car was based on the MGB, and was intended as a replacement for the Austin-Healey 3000 which had had its day. This was the  MGC .   By the late 1960's, the MGB was beginning to be affected by exhaust emission and safety legislation which required frequent modifications to the cars specification. This was particularly the case with those models destined for export, especially for the USA.   Detail modifications continued until 1970 when the most obvious change was to a matt black recessed grille which, unlike the original grille, had no obvious link to the MG grille of old. Other changes included modified rear lights, Rostyle sculpted steel wheels, and revised interior fittings. There was also a change to SU HIF carburettors in an effort to improve the exhaust emissions problem.           The MGB GT V8      In 1973, another big engined MGB appeared on the scene, but unlike the MGC, this one was to be extremely well received to the extent that demand far outstripped supply. But in spite of this, this car was also to disappear after a relatively short production run - it was the MGB GT V8.     A former Mini racer turned car tuner named Ken Costello set the scene for what would follow when he uprated an MGB by ditching its heavy iron straight four 'B-Series' engine in favour of the ex-Buick alloy V8 engine which had been adopted by the Rover Car Company. It did not take the engineers at Abingdon long to get wind of Costello's exploits - and indeed no less a person than British Leyland boss Lord Stokes invited Costello to demonstrate his prototype. Within a very short space of time, MG was given the go-ahead to build its own prototype - work on which began in August 1971 - but between then and the launch of the factory MGB GT V8 two years later, Costello was able to do healthy business. Naturally Costello stole a march on British Leyland since he had no corporate ""red tape"" to deal with - so while MG had to deal with the problems of type approval and other modifications, Costello was able to shoehorn the engine into place on a custom-built basis. When MG launched its own MGB GT V8, the hitherto easy supply of parts essential to Costello's own conversion began to be stemmed, but undaunted, Costello found it cheaper to buy secondhand Buick engines from Belgium, which he brought back by the lorry-load and rebuilt using new Rover parts.     The car made use of the 3532cc aluminium Rover V8 engine as was being used in the Range Rover. Developed from an early Buick design, the engine was very light in weight - it actually weighed less than the original B-series MGB engine - and in standard tune offered a healthy 137bhp. It fitted snugly into the MGB's engine bay after only slight modification to the bulkhead, and with the development of a low-rise exhaust manifold allowed MG to use the standard MGB bonnet. Furthermore, the engine could, unlike in the MGC, be fitted without dispensing with the front suspension crossmember, so the coil-spring type suspension could be retained. The standard suspension was employed at the rear too, but the ride height was increased by an inch all round. The engine was mated to the MGC gearbox and rear-end transmission, although the ratios were slightly modified.   The combination of the Rover V8 engine and the MGB produced an excellent touring car with high performance, good economy, and good handling. The press received it well and it found a ready market, although it was never exported to the USA for some unknown reason.   In 1976, the car was killed off, supposedly because of the limited supply of engines, which were being built under licence and were required for Rover's new SD1 saloon. Another contributing factor to the cars demise was the fuel crisis which was experienced in 1975, which led people to buy smaller engined, more economical cars. Given the obvious success of the car, it seems strange that it was ended, and possibly there was more to it that just these factors. The MGB GT V8 was, after all, in much greater demand than Triumph's V8-engined Stag, which continued in production...        V8 Conversion overview  (pdf)     V8 Conversion overview  (html)     V8 Conversions   V8 Register - MG Car Club                  The End of an Era      Two years earlier, in 1974, both roadster and GT (including the V8) had received the black ""5mph"" bumpers and an increase in ride height, in much the same way as the Midget had done. The front bumper was shaped to merge into the grille which at least had a token resemblance to the earlier traditional shape. As with the Midget, the weight of the bumpers and increased ride height did nothing to the cars handling, increasing roll and oversteer. An attempt was made to rectify this problem in 1976, when stabilisers were fitted to the front and rear suspension, which was quite successful and considerably improved the cars handling.   The MGB continued in this form, with further detail changes to the specification, until production finally came to an end in 1980. By then the car was definitely past its best, but there was no replacement to be had. Development work had been stopped at Abingdon, for British Leyland preferred to concentrate on their Triumph products. It was claimed that BL were losing money on every MGB built, but this was hard to believe since there were few major changes to the cars specification over the years, so development costs must have been recouped long before the end.   However, the end it was, not just for the MGB, but for MG and Abingdon as a separate entity within the British Leyland group. The plant was closed, but the furore this caused among MG enthusiasts around the world caused the parent company to realise that the MG name was a valuable commodity.   While it was thought that the MG name as a sports car manufacturer was dead, the name lived on being carried by a number of BLs sporting saloons, and is now being re-born by the now Rover Group in the guise of new sports cars - the MG RV8 and the new MG MGF.

MGB production continued throughout restructuring of the British motor industry, and the parent companys transition from BMC to  British Motor Holdings  (in 1966) and to  British Leyland Motor Corporation  (in 1968).

The MGB featured a four-cylinder  petrol engine . A derivative model, called the ""MGC"" featured a six-cylinder engine and a later variant, called the ""MGB GT V8"" fitted with the ex- Buick   Rover V8  engine was made from 1973 to 1976. Combined production volume of MGB, MGC and MGB GT V8 models was 523,836 cars. A very limited-production ""revival"" model with only 2,000 units made, called ""RV8"" was produced by  Rover  in the 1990s. Despite the similarity in appearance to the roadster, the RV8 had less than 5% parts interchangeability with the original car.   The MGB was a relatively modern design at the time of its introduction. It utilized a  monocoque  structure that reduced both weight and manufacturing costs as well as adding chassis strength. This was a considerable improvement in comparison to that of the traditional  body-on-frame  construction used on the earlier MGA and  T-type  models as well as the MGB's rival, the Triumph TR series. The design included wind-up windows and a comfortable driver's compartment, with plenty of legroom and a parcel shelf behind the seats.   The MGB's performance was brisk for the period, with a 060 mph (96 km/h) time of just over 11 seconds, aided by the relatively light weight of the car. Handling was one of the MGB's strong points. The 3-bearing 1798 cc  B-Series  engine produced 95 hp (71 kW) at 5400 rpm. The engine was upgraded in October 1964 to a five-bearing crankshaft in an effort to improve reliability. A majority of MGBs were exported to United States. In 1974, as US air pollution emission standards became more rigorous, US-market MGBs were de-tuned for compliance. As well as a marked reduction in performance, the MGB gained an inch in ride height and the distinctive rubber bumpers which came to replace the chrome for all markets.   The MGB was one of the first cars to feature controlled  crumple zones  designed to protect the driver and passenger in a 30 mph (48 km/h) impact with an immovable barrier (200 ton).

The body was a pure two-seater but a small rear seat was a rare optional extra at one point. By making better use of space the MGB was able to offer more passenger and luggage accommodation than the earlier MGA while being 3 inches (75 mm) shorter overall. The suspension was also softer, giving a smoother ride, and the larger engine gave a slightly higher top speed. Wheel diameter dropped from 15 to 14 inches (360 mm).     [ edit ]   Mark II          1973 MG MGB roadster (North America)       In late 1967, sufficient changes were introduced for the factory to define a Mark II model. Changes included synchromesh on all 4 gears with revised ratios, an optional  Borg-Warner   automatic  gearbox (except in the US), a new rear axle and an alternator in place of the  dynamo . To accommodate the new gearboxes there were significant changes to the sheet metal in the floorpan, and a new flat-topped transmission tunnel. All models are rear-wheel drive. To meet US safety regulations, later North American tourers got three windscreen wipers instead of just two (to sweep the required percentage of the glass), and also received a plastic and foam rubber covered ""safety""  dashboard , dubbed the ""Abingdon pillow"". Other markets continued with the steel dashboard. Rubery Owen  ROstyle  wheels were introduced to replace the previous pressed steel versions in 1969 and reclining seats were standardized in 1970. 1969 also saw a new front grille, recessed, in black aluminium. The more traditional-looking polished grille returned in 1972 with a black ""honeycomb"" insert. 1970 saw split rear bumpers with the number-plate in between, 1971 returned to the earlier five-piece style.     [ edit ]   Mark III   Further changes in 1972 brought about the Mark III. The main changes were to the interior with a new  fascia  and improved heater.          1977 North America-spec MG MGB       In 1974, in order to meet US impact regulations, US models had the chrome bumper overriders replaced with large rubber ones, and in the second half of 1974 the chrome bumpers were replaced altogether. A new, steel-reinforced black rubber bumper at the front incorporated the grille area as well, giving a major restyling to the B's nose, and a matching rear bumper completed the change. New US headlight height regulations also meant that the headlamps were now too low. Rather than redesign the front of the car, British Leyland raised the car's suspension by 1-inch (25 mm). This, in combination with the new, far heavier bumpers resulted in significantly poorer handling. For the 1975 model year only, the front  anti-roll bar  was deleted from the standard car as a cost-saving measure (though it was still available as an option). The damage done by the British Leyland response to US legislation was partially alleviated by further revisions to the suspension geometry in 1977, when a rear anti-roll bar was made standard equipment on all models.   US emissions regulations also reduced horsepower, and by the time of the B's demise in 1980, performance was decidedly lacklustre.                   1979 MG MGB (North America)                     1980 MG MGB (North America)               [ edit ]   MGB GT     MGB GT           Production   1965-1980  125282 made       Body style(s)   2 door  coup       Engine(s)   1798 cc  B-Series   I4       Length   153 inches (3886 mm)  158 inches (4019 mm) rubber bumper version [ 2 ]       Width   60 inches (1524 mm) [ 2 ]       Height   50 inches (1238 mm)  51 inches (1295 mm) rubber bumper version [ 2 ]       The fixed-roof  MGB GT  was introduced in October 1965 and production continued until 1980, although export to the US ceased in 1974. The MGB GT sported a  Pininfarina -designed  hatchback  body. The new configuration was a  2+2  design but the new rear bench seat was very small and of limited use for adults or older children; however, there was more luggage space than in the roadster. The engine and gearbox were the same as those in the roadster. In fact relatively few components differed, although the MGB GT did receive different suspension springs and anti-roll bars. The MGB GT also featured a different windscreen which was more easily and inexpensively serviceable. Early prototypes such as the MGB Berlinette produced by the Belgian coach builder Jacques Coune utilized a raised windscreen in order to accommodate the fastback.   Acceleration of the GT was slightly slower than that of the roadster due to its increased weight, though handling improved due to significantly increased chassis rigidity and perhaps slightly better weight distribution. Top speed improved by 5 mph (8 km/h) to 105 mph (170 km/h) due to better aerodynamics.     [ edit ]   MGC     MGC & MGC GT           Production   1967-1969  9,002 made  (4544 MGC, 4458 MGC GT)       Body style(s)   2-door roadster  2-door  coupe       Engine(s)   2912 cc  C-Series   I6       The  MGC  was a 2912 cc,  straight-6  version of the MGB sold from 1967 through to 1969 with some sales running on into 1970, and given the code ADO52. It was intended as a replacement for the  Austin-Healey 3000  which would have been ADO51 but in that form, never got beyond the design proposal stage. The first engine to be considered was an Australian-designed six cylinder version of the BMC B-Series but the production versions used a 7 main bearing development of the Morris Engines designed  C-Series  that was also to be used for the new  Austin 3-litre  4-Door saloon. In the twin SU carburettor form used in the MGC the engine produced 145 bhp (108 kW) at 5250 rpm. [ 3 ]  The body shell needed considerable revision around the engine bay and to the floor pan, but externally the only differences were a distinctive bonnet bulge to accommodate the relocated radiator and a teardrop for  carburettor  clearance. It had different brakes from the MGB, 15 inch wheels, a lower geared rack and pinion and special  torsion bar  suspension with telescopic dampers. Like the MGB, it was available as a coup (GT) and roadster. An overdrive gearbox or three-speed automatic gearbox were available as options. The car was capable of 120 mph (193 km/h) and a 0-60 mph time of 10.0 seconds. [ 3 ]   The heavy engine (209 lb heavier than the 1798 cc MGB engine) and new suspension changed the vehicle's handling, and it received a very mixed response in the automotive press. The MGC was cancelled in 1969 after less than two years of production. Today the car is considered very collectible and the main causes of the poor reputation relating to handling have in the main been overcome by better tyres and subtle modification of suspension settings.       [ edit ]   MGB GT V8     MGB GT V8     Production   1973-1976  2591 made       Body style(s)   2 door  coupe       Engine(s)   3528 cc  Rover   V8       MG began offering the  MGB GT V8  in 1973 utilising the ubiquitous aluminium-block 3528 cc  Rover V8 engine , first fitted to the  Rover P5B . This engine had been used in the A-body platform Buick Special and Oldsmobile F-85 and was the lightest mass-production V8 in the world, with a dry weight of only 318 lb (144 kg), and was about 60 lb (27 kg) lighter than its 4-cylinder counterpart by the MOWOG (Morris-Wolseley Garages) foundry. Some improvements were made by MG-Rover, and the engine found a long-lived niche in the British motor industry. These cars were similar to those already being produced in significant volume by tuner  Ken Costello . MG even contracted Costello to build them a prototype MGB GT V8. However, the powerful 180 bhp (134 kW) engine used by Costello for his conversions was replaced for production by MG with a more modestly tuned version producing only 137 bhp(102 kW) at 5000 rpm. But 193 lbft (262 Nm) of torque helped it hit 60 mph (97 km/h) in around 8 seconds, and go on to a respectable 125 mph (201 km/h) top speed.   By virtue of its aluminium cylinder block and heads, the Rover V8 engine actually weighed approximately forty pounds less than MG's iron  four cylinder . Unlike the MGC, the MGB GT V8's increased power and torque did not require significant chassis changes or sacrificed handling.   Only GT versions of the  V8 -powered MGB were produced by the factory. Production ended in 1976.   MG never attempted to export the MGB GT V8 to the United States. They chose not to develop a left-hand-drive version or to seek US air pollution emission certification of the MGB GT V8, although the Rover V8 engine was offered in US-bound Rover models throughout the same period and beyond. British Leyland Motor Corporation management cited insufficient production capacity to support anticipated demand for the V8 engine in MGB GT, so they priced the MGB GT V8 high. [ citation needed ]   The MGB GT V8 was very warmly received by the automotive press, but British Leyland Motor Corporation was reportedly concerned that the MGB GT V8 would overshadow their other products, including the more expensive and less powerful  Triumph Stag .       [ edit ]   RV8     MG RV8           Production   1993-1995  2000 made       Body style(s)   2 seat sports/racer       Engine(s)   3946 cc  Rover   V8       Interest in small roadsters increased in the 1990s following the introduction of the  Mazda MX-5 , and MG (now owned by  Rover Group ) capitalized on this in 1992 by producing new body panels to create an updated version of the old car. The suspension was only slightly updated, sharing the old leaf sprung rear of the MGB. The boot lid and doors were shared with the original car, as were the rear drum brakes. However, the engine was the respected aluminum  Rover V8 , previously used in the MGB GT V8. A  limited-slip differential  was also fitted.   The interior was built to luxury standards, featuring  veneered  burr  elm  woodwork and  Connolly Leather . [ 4 ]   Performance was good, with 190 bhp (142 kW) at 4,750 rpm and 060 mph (96 km/h) in 5.9 s. Largely due to the rear drum brakes and rear leaf springs (perceived to be too old fashioned for a modern performance car), the RV8 was not popular with road testers at the time. However, this did not prevent the RV8 from being a moderate sales success, and it paved the way for the introduction of the modern  MGF  a few years later.   It also capitalized on an interest in British products in  Japan . A sizeable chunk of MG RV8 production went to that country.       [ edit ]   Racing performance     [ edit ]   Overall or class wins   The MGB was highly successful in international road competition events such as the  Monte Carlo Rally . In 1964 it won the GT category,  Sebring , the Spa 1000 km and the 1963, 1964 and 1965  Le Mans 24 hour  beating more powerful cars in the process.

MGB production continued throughout restructuring of the British motor industry, and the parent companys transition from BMC to  British Motor Holdings  (in 1966) and to  British Leyland Motor Corporation  (in 1968).           Contents       1   MGB Roadster     1.1   Mark II   1.2   Mark III       2   MGB GT   3   MGC   4   MGB GT V8   5   RV8   6   Racing performance     6.1   Overall or class wins       7   Gallery   8   References   9   External links              Originally introduced as a  convertible  ("" roadster ""), a  coup  (the  hatchbacked  ""GT"", almost a  shooting brake ) version, with  2+2  seating, was introduced in 1965. The MGB featured a four-cylinder  petrol engine . A derivative model, called the ""MGC"" featured a six-cylinder engine and a later variant, called the ""MGB GT V8"" fitted with the ex- Buick   Rover V8  engine was made from 1973 to 1976. Combined production volume of MGB, MGC and MGB GT V8 models was 523,836 cars. A very limited-production ""revival"" model with only 2,000 units made, called ""RV8"" was produced by  Rover  in the 1990s. Despite the similarity in appearance to the roadster, the RV8 had less than 5% parts interchangeability with the original car.   The MGB was a relatively modern design at the time of its introduction. It utilized a  monocoque  structure that reduced both weight and manufacturing costs as well as adding chassis strength. This was a considerable improvement in comparison to that of the traditional  body-on-frame  construction used on the earlier MGA and  T-type  models as well as the MGB's rival, the Triumph TR series. The design included wind-up windows and a comfortable driver's compartment, with plenty of legroom and a parcel shelf behind the seats.   The MGB's performance was brisk for the period, with a 060 mph (96 km/h) time of just over 11 seconds, aided by the relatively light weight of the car. Handling was one of the MGB's strong points. The 3-bearing 1798 cc  B-Series  engine produced 95 hp (71 kW) at 5400 rpm. The engine was upgraded in October 1964 to a five-bearing crankshaft in an effort to improve reliability. A majority of MGBs were exported to United States. In 1974, as US air pollution emission standards became more rigorous, US-market MGBs were de-tuned for compliance. As well as a marked reduction in performance, the MGB gained an inch in ride height and the distinctive rubber bumpers which came to replace the chrome for all markets.   The MGB was one of the first cars to feature controlled  crumple zones  designed to protect the driver and passenger in a 30 mph (48 km/h) impact with an immovable barrier (200 ton). [ 1 ]   See:   1967 MGB 30mph frontal impact into a concrete block, Abingdon in 1967 (scroll down)     [ edit ]   MGB Roadster     MGB Roadster           Production   1962-1980  399,070 made       Body style(s)   2-door  roadster       Engine(s)   1798 cc  B-Series   I4       Length   3886 mm (153 in)  4019 mm (158.2 in) rubber bumper version [ 2 ]       Width   1524 mm (60 in) [ 2 ]       Height   1219 mm (48 in)  1295 mm (51 in) rubber bumper version [ 2 ]       The roadster was the first of the MGB range to be produced. The body was a pure two-seater but a small rear seat was a rare optional extra at one point. By making better use of space the MGB was able to offer more passenger and luggage accommodation than the earlier MGA while being 3 inches (75 mm) shorter overall. The suspension was also softer, giving a smoother ride, and the larger engine gave a slightly higher top speed. Wheel diameter dropped from 15 to 14 inches (360 mm).     [ edit ]   Mark II          1973 MG MGB roadster (North America)       In late 1967, sufficient changes were introduced for the factory to define a Mark II model. Changes included synchromesh on all 4 gears with revised ratios, an optional  Borg-Warner   automatic  gearbox (except in the US), a new rear axle and an alternator in place of the  dynamo . To accommodate the new gearboxes there were significant changes to the sheet metal in the floorpan, and a new flat-topped transmission tunnel. All models are rear-wheel drive. To meet US safety regulations, later North American tourers got three windscreen wipers instead of just two (to sweep the required percentage of the glass), and also received a plastic and foam rubber covered ""safety""  dashboard , dubbed the ""Abingdon pillow"". Other markets continued with the steel dashboard. Rubery Owen  ROstyle  wheels were introduced to replace the previous pressed steel versions in 1969 and reclining seats were standardized in 1970. 1969 also saw a new front grille, recessed, in black aluminium. The more traditional-looking polished grille returned in 1972 with a black ""honeycomb"" insert. 1970 saw split rear bumpers with the number-plate in between, 1971 returned to the earlier five-piece style.     [ edit ]   Mark III   Further changes in 1972 brought about the Mark III. The main changes were to the interior with a new  fascia  and improved heater.          1977 North America-spec MG MGB       In 1974, in order to meet US impact regulations, US models had the chrome bumper overriders replaced with large rubber ones, and in the second half of 1974 the chrome bumpers were replaced altogether. A new, steel-reinforced black rubber bumper at the front incorporated the grille area as well, giving a major restyling to the B's nose, and a matching rear bumper completed the change. New US headlight height regulations also meant that the headlamps were now too low. Rather than redesign the front of the car, British Leyland raised the car's suspension by 1-inch (25 mm). This, in combination with the new, far heavier bumpers resulted in significantly poorer handling. For the 1975 model year only, the front  anti-roll bar  was deleted from the standard car as a cost-saving measure (though it was still available as an option). The damage done by the British Leyland response to US legislation was partially alleviated by further revisions to the suspension geometry in 1977, when a rear anti-roll bar was made standard equipment on all models.   US emissions regulations also reduced horsepower, and by the time of the B's demise in 1980, performance was decidedly lacklustre.                   1979 MG MGB (North America)                     1980 MG MGB (North America)               [ edit ]   MGB GT     MGB GT           Production   1965-1980  125282 made       Body style(s)   2 door  coup       Engine(s)   1798 cc  B-Series   I4       Length   153 inches (3886 mm)  158 inches (4019 mm) rubber bumper version [ 2 ]       Width   60 inches (1524 mm) [ 2 ]       Height   50 inches (1238 mm)  51 inches (1295 mm) rubber bumper version [ 2 ]       The fixed-roof  MGB GT  was introduced in October 1965 and production continued until 1980, although export to the US ceased in 1974. The MGB GT sported a  Pininfarina -designed  hatchback  body. The new configuration was a  2+2  design but the new rear bench seat was very small and of limited use for adults or older children; however, there was more luggage space than in the roadster. The engine and gearbox were the same as those in the roadster. In fact relatively few components differed, although the MGB GT did receive different suspension springs and anti-roll bars. The MGB GT also featured a different windscreen which was more easily and inexpensively serviceable. Early prototypes such as the MGB Berlinette produced by the Belgian coach builder Jacques Coune utilized a raised windscreen in order to accommodate the fastback.   Acceleration of the GT was slightly slower than that of the roadster due to its increased weight, though handling improved due to significantly increased chassis rigidity and perhaps slightly better weight distribution. Top speed improved by 5 mph (8 km/h) to 105 mph (170 km/h) due to better aerodynamics.     [ edit ]   MGC     MGC & MGC GT           Production   1967-1969  9,002 made  (4544 MGC, 4458 MGC GT)       Body style(s)   2-door roadster  2-door  coupe       Engine(s)   2912 cc  C-Series   I6       The  MGC  was a 2912 cc,  straight-6  version of the MGB sold from 1967 through to 1969 with some sales running on into 1970, and given the code ADO52. It was intended as a replacement for the  Austin-Healey 3000  which would have been ADO51 but in that form, never got beyond the design proposal stage. The first engine to be considered was an Australian-designed six cylinder version of the BMC B-Series but the production versions used a 7 main bearing development of the Morris Engines designed  C-Series  that was also to be used for the new  Austin 3-litre  4-Door saloon. In the twin SU carburettor form used in the MGC the engine produced 145 bhp (108 kW) at 5250 rpm. [ 3 ]  The body shell needed considerable revision around the engine bay and to the floor pan, but externally the only differences were a distinctive bonnet bulge to accommodate the relocated radiator and a teardrop for  carburettor  clearance. It had different brakes from the MGB, 15 inch wheels, a lower geared rack and pinion and special  torsion bar  suspension with telescopic dampers. Like the MGB, it was available as a coup (GT) and roadster. An overdrive gearbox or three-speed automatic gearbox were available as options. The car was capable of 120 mph (193 km/h) and a 0-60 mph time of 10.0 seconds. [ 3 ]   The heavy engine (209 lb heavier than the 1798 cc MGB engine) and new suspension changed the vehicle's handling, and it received a very mixed response in the automotive press. The MGC was cancelled in 1969 after less than two years of production. Today the car is considered very collectible and the main causes of the poor reputation relating to handling have in the main been overcome by better tyres and subtle modification of suspension settings.       [ edit ]   MGB GT V8     MGB GT V8     Production   1973-1976  2591 made       Body style(s)   2 door  coupe       Engine(s)   3528 cc  Rover   V8       MG began offering the  MGB GT V8  in 1973 utilising the ubiquitous aluminium-block 3528 cc  Rover V8 engine , first fitted to the  Rover P5B . This engine had been used in the A-body platform Buick Special and Oldsmobile F-85 and was the lightest mass-production V8 in the world, with a dry weight of only 318 lb (144 kg), and was about 60 lb (27 kg) lighter than its 4-cylinder counterpart by the MOWOG (Morris-Wolseley Garages) foundry. Some improvements were made by MG-Rover, and the engine found a long-lived niche in the British motor industry. These cars were similar to those already being produced in significant volume by tuner  Ken Costello . MG even contracted Costello to build them a prototype MGB GT V8. However, the powerful 180 bhp (134 kW) engine used by Costello for his conversions was replaced for production by MG with a more modestly tuned version producing only 137 bhp(102 kW) at 5000 rpm. But 193 lbft (262 Nm) of torque helped it hit 60 mph (97 km/h) in around 8 seconds, and go on to a respectable 125 mph (201 km/h) top speed.   By virtue of its aluminium cylinder block and heads, the Rover V8 engine actually weighed approximately forty pounds less than MG's iron  four cylinder . Unlike the MGC, the MGB GT V8's increased power and torque did not require significant chassis changes or sacrificed handling.   Only GT versions of the  V8 -powered MGB were produced by the factory. Production ended in 1976.   MG never attempted to export the MGB GT V8 to the United States. They chose not to develop a left-hand-drive version or to seek US air pollution emission certification of the MGB GT V8, although the Rover V8 engine was offered in US-bound Rover models throughout the same period and beyond. British Leyland Motor Corporation management cited insufficient production capacity to support anticipated demand for the V8 engine in MGB GT, so they priced the MGB GT V8 high. [ citation needed ]   The MGB GT V8 was very warmly received by the automotive press, but British Leyland Motor Corporation was reportedly concerned that the MGB GT V8 would overshadow their other products, including the more expensive and less powerful  Triumph Stag .       [ edit ]   RV8     MG RV8           Production   1993-1995  2000 made       Body style(s)   2 seat sports/racer       Engine(s)   3946 cc  Rover   V8       Interest in small roadsters increased in the 1990s following the introduction of the  Mazda MX-5 , and MG (now owned by  Rover Group ) capitalized on this in 1992 by producing new body panels to create an updated version of the old car. The suspension was only slightly updated, sharing the old leaf sprung rear of the MGB. The boot lid and doors were shared with the original car, as were the rear drum brakes. However, the engine was the respected aluminum  Rover V8 , previously used in the MGB GT V8. A  limited-slip differential  was also fitted.   The interior was built to luxury standards, featuring  veneered  burr  elm  woodwork and  Connolly Leather . [ 4 ]   Performance was good, with 190 bhp (142 kW) at 4,750 rpm and 060 mph (96 km/h) in 5.9 s. Largely due to the rear drum brakes and rear leaf springs (perceived to be too old fashioned for a modern performance car), the RV8 was not popular with road testers at the time. However, this did not prevent the RV8 from being a moderate sales success, and it paved the way for the introduction of the modern  MGF  a few years later.   It also capitalized on an interest in British products in  Japan . A sizeable chunk of MG RV8 production went to that country.       [ edit ]   Racing performance     [ edit ]   Overall or class wins   The MGB was highly successful in international road competition events such as the  Monte Carlo Rally . In 1964 it won the GT category,  Sebring , the Spa 1000 km and the 1963, 1964 and 1965  Le Mans 24 hour  beating more powerful cars in the process.

Although they are one of the simplest and oldest devices, it can be noted that relays are among one of the most useful and simple devices. This simple electromagnetic switch is made up of a set of contacts, spring, armature and an electromagnet which performs the vital function of isolating one electrical circuit from anotherut how does this happen?    There are two completely independent circuits comprising this auto part: the armature and the electromagnet. The electromagnet acts as the first circuit controlled by a switch that can be found at the bottom of the relay. This switch acts as the controlling power to the electromagnet which attracts the armature when it is turned on. On the other hand, the armature acts as a second circuit. The armature completes the second circuit when the electromagnet is energized, thereby causing the light to be turned on. However, an electromagnet will not complete the circuit when it is not energized. When this happens, the strings will pull the armature away resulting to a dark light.     Volvo relays can be used in several applications. You can use them either to set up a starter kill with a hidden switch, to turn on an amplifier, to flash your car lights, and a host of other applications. However, you must consider two specifications when selecting a relay for an automobile. First is the coil voltage. Normally, the coil voltage for relays is 12 volts. The second one is the current carrying capacity. This tells how much current can be passed through the contacts without damaging them.     To ensure durability and safety, use only genuine Volvo relays for your Volvo vehicle. Our site offers Volvo parts which include  Volvo fuel pump  ,  Volvo ignition coil ,  Volvo oil filter  ,  Volvo alternator  ,  Volvo performance chip   and a lot more.

MGB production continued throughout restructuring of the British motor industry, and the parent companys transition from BMC to  British Motor Holdings  (in 1966) and to  British Leyland Motor Corporation  (in 1968).           Contents       1   MGB Roadster     1.1   Mark II   1.2   Mark III       2   MGB GT   3   MGC   4   MGB GT V8   5   RV8   6   Racing performance     6.1   Overall or class wins       7   Gallery   8   References   9   External links              Originally introduced as a  convertible  ("" roadster ""), a  coup  (the  hatchbacked  ""GT"", almost a  shooting brake ) version, with  2+2  seating, was introduced in 1965. The MGB featured a four-cylinder  petrol engine . A derivative model, called the ""MGC"" featured a six-cylinder engine and a later variant, called the ""MGB GT V8"" fitted with the ex- Buick   Rover V8  engine was made from 1973 to 1976. Combined production volume of MGB, MGC and MGB GT V8 models was 523,836 cars. A very limited-production ""revival"" model with only 2,000 units made, called ""RV8"" was produced by  Rover  in the 1990s. Despite the similarity in appearance to the roadster, the RV8 had less than 5% parts interchangeability with the original car.   The MGB was a relatively modern design at the time of its introduction. It utilized a  monocoque  structure that reduced both weight and manufacturing costs as well as adding chassis strength. This was a considerable improvement in comparison to that of the traditional  body-on-frame  construction used on the earlier MGA and  T-type  models as well as the MGB's rival, the Triumph TR series. The design included wind-up windows and a comfortable driver's compartment, with plenty of legroom and a parcel shelf behind the seats.   The MGB's performance was brisk for the period, with a 060 mph (96 km/h) time of just over 11 seconds, aided by the relatively light weight of the car. Handling was one of the MGB's strong points. The 3-bearing 1798 cc  B-Series  engine produced 95 hp (71 kW) at 5400 rpm. The engine was upgraded in October 1964 to a five-bearing crankshaft in an effort to improve reliability. A majority of MGBs were exported to United States. In 1974, as US air pollution emission standards became more rigorous, US-market MGBs were de-tuned for compliance. As well as a marked reduction in performance, the MGB gained an inch in ride height and the distinctive rubber bumpers which came to replace the chrome for all markets.   The MGB was one of the first cars to feature controlled  crumple zones  designed to protect the driver and passenger in a 30 mph (48 km/h) impact with an immovable barrier (200 ton). [ 1 ]   See:   1967 MGB 30mph frontal impact into a concrete block, Abingdon in 1967 (scroll down)     [ edit ]   MGB Roadster     MGB Roadster           Production   1962-1980  399,070 made       Body style(s)   2-door  roadster       Engine(s)   1798 cc  B-Series   I4       Length   3886 mm (153 in)  4019 mm (158.2 in) rubber bumper version [ 2 ]       Width   1524 mm (60 in) [ 2 ]       Height   1219 mm (48 in)  1295 mm (51 in) rubber bumper version [ 2 ]       The roadster was the first of the MGB range to be produced. The body was a pure two-seater but a small rear seat was a rare optional extra at one point. By making better use of space the MGB was able to offer more passenger and luggage accommodation than the earlier MGA while being 3 inches (75 mm) shorter overall. The suspension was also softer, giving a smoother ride, and the larger engine gave a slightly higher top speed. Wheel diameter dropped from 15 to 14 inches (360 mm).     [ edit ]   Mark II          1973 MG MGB roadster (North America)       In late 1967, sufficient changes were introduced for the factory to define a Mark II model. Changes included synchromesh on all 4 gears with revised ratios, an optional  Borg-Warner   automatic  gearbox (except in the US), a new rear axle and an alternator in place of the  dynamo . To accommodate the new gearboxes there were significant changes to the sheet metal in the floorpan, and a new flat-topped transmission tunnel. All models are rear-wheel drive. To meet US safety regulations, later North American tourers got three windscreen wipers instead of just two (to sweep the required percentage of the glass), and also received a plastic and foam rubber covered ""safety""  dashboard , dubbed the ""Abingdon pillow"". Other markets continued with the steel dashboard. Rubery Owen  ROstyle  wheels were introduced to replace the previous pressed steel versions in 1969 and reclining seats were standardized in 1970. 1969 also saw a new front grille, recessed, in black aluminium. The more traditional-looking polished grille returned in 1972 with a black ""honeycomb"" insert. 1970 saw split rear bumpers with the number-plate in between, 1971 returned to the earlier five-piece style.     [ edit ]   Mark III   Further changes in 1972 brought about the Mark III. The main changes were to the interior with a new  fascia  and improved heater.          1977 North America-spec MG MGB       In 1974, in order to meet US impact regulations, US models had the chrome bumper overriders replaced with large rubber ones, and in the second half of 1974 the chrome bumpers were replaced altogether. A new, steel-reinforced black rubber bumper at the front incorporated the grille area as well, giving a major restyling to the B's nose, and a matching rear bumper completed the change. New US headlight height regulations also meant that the headlamps were now too low. Rather than redesign the front of the car, British Leyland raised the car's suspension by 1-inch (25 mm). This, in combination with the new, far heavier bumpers resulted in significantly poorer handling. For the 1975 model year only, the front  anti-roll bar  was deleted from the standard car as a cost-saving measure (though it was still available as an option). The damage done by the British Leyland response to US legislation was partially alleviated by further revisions to the suspension geometry in 1977, when a rear anti-roll bar was made standard equipment on all models.   US emissions regulations also reduced horsepower, and by the time of the B's demise in 1980, performance was decidedly lacklustre.                   1979 MG MGB (North America)                     Early 1970s MG MGB (North America)               [ edit ]   MGB GT     MGB GT           Production   1965-1980  125282 made       Body style(s)   2 door  coup       Engine(s)   1798 cc  B-Series   I4       Length   153 inches (3886 mm)  158 inches (4019 mm) rubber bumper version [ 2 ]       Width   60 inches (1524 mm) [ 2 ]       Height   50 inches (1238 mm)  51 inches (1295 mm) rubber bumper version [ 2 ]       The fixed-roof  MGB GT  was introduced in October 1965 and production continued until 1980, although export to the US ceased in 1974. The MGB GT sported a  Pininfarina -designed  hatchback  body. The new configuration was a  2+2  design but the new rear bench seat was very small and of limited use for adults or older children; however, there was more luggage space than in the roadster. The engine and gearbox were the same as those in the roadster. In fact relatively few components differed, although the MGB GT did receive different suspension springs and anti-roll bars. The MGB GT also featured a different windscreen which was more easily and inexpensively serviceable. Early prototypes such as the MGB Berlinette produced by the Belgian coach builder Jacques Coune utilized a raised windscreen in order to accommodate the fastback.   Acceleration of the GT was slightly slower than that of the roadster due to its increased weight, though handling improved due to significantly increased chassis rigidity and perhaps slightly better weight distribution. Top speed improved by 5 mph (8 km/h) to 105 mph (170 km/h) due to better aerodynamics.     [ edit ]   MGC     MGC & MGC GT           Production   1967-1969  9,002 made  (4544 MGC, 4458 MGC GT)       Body style(s)   2-door roadster  2-door  coupe       Engine(s)   2912 cc  C-Series   I6       The  MGC  was a 2912 cc,  straight-6  version of the MGB sold from 1967 through to 1969 with some sales running on into 1970, and given the code ADO52. It was intended as a replacement for the  Austin-Healey 3000  which would have been ADO51 but in that form, never got beyond the design proposal stage. The first engine to be considered was an Australian-designed six cylinder version of the BMC B-Series but the production versions used a 7 main bearing development of the Morris Engines designed  C-Series  that was also to be used for the new  Austin 3-litre  4-Door saloon. In the twin SU carburettor form used in the MGC the engine produced 145 bhp (108 kW) at 5250 rpm. [ 3 ]  The body shell needed considerable revision around the engine bay and to the floor pan, but externally the only differences were a distinctive bonnet bulge to accommodate the relocated radiator and a teardrop for  carburettor  clearance. It had different brakes from the MGB, 15 inch wheels, a lower geared rack and pinion and special  torsion bar  suspension with telescopic dampers. Like the MGB, it was available as a coup (GT) and roadster. An overdrive gearbox or three-speed automatic gearbox were available as options. The car was capable of 120 mph (193 km/h) and a 0-60 mph time of 10.0 seconds. [ 3 ]   The heavy engine (209 lb heavier than the 1798 cc MGB engine) and new suspension changed the vehicle's handling, and it received a very mixed response in the automotive press. The MGC was cancelled in 1969 after less than two years of production. Today the car is considered very collectible and the main causes of the poor reputation relating to handling have in the main been overcome by better tyres and subtle modification of suspension settings.       [ edit ]   MGB GT V8     MGB GT V8     Production   1973-1976  2591 made       Body style(s)   2 door  coupe       Engine(s)   3528 cc  Rover   V8       MG began offering the  MGB GT V8  in 1973 utilising the ubiquitous aluminium-block 3528 cc  Rover V8 engine , first fitted to the  Rover P5B . This engine had been used in the A-body platform Buick Special and Oldsmobile F-85 and was the lightest mass-production V8 in the world, with a dry weight of only 318 lb (144 kg), and was about 60 lb (27 kg) lighter than its 4-cylinder counterpart by the MOWOG (Morris-Wolseley Garages) foundry. Some improvements were made by MG-Rover, and the engine found a long-lived niche in the British motor industry. These cars were similar to those already being produced in significant volume by tuner  Ken Costello . MG even contracted Costello to build them a prototype MGB GT V8. However, the powerful 180 bhp (134 kW) engine used by Costello for his conversions was replaced for production by MG with a more modestly tuned version producing only 137 bhp(102 kW) at 5000 rpm. But 193 lbft (262 Nm) of torque helped it hit 60 mph (97 km/h) in around 8 seconds, and go on to a respectable 125 mph (201 km/h) top speed.   By virtue of its aluminium cylinder block and heads, the Rover V8 engine actually weighed approximately forty pounds less than MG's iron  four cylinder . Unlike the MGC, the MGB GT V8's increased power and torque did not require significant chassis changes or sacrificed handling.   Only GT versions of the  V8 -powered MGB were produced by the factory. Production ended in 1976.   MG never attempted to export the MGB GT V8 to the United States. They chose not to develop a left-hand-drive version or to seek US air pollution emission certification of the MGB GT V8, although the Rover V8 engine was offered in US-bound Rover models throughout the same period and beyond. British Leyland Motor Corporation management cited insufficient production capacity to support anticipated demand for the V8 engine in MGB GT, so they priced the MGB GT V8 high. [ citation needed ]   The MGB GT V8 was very warmly received by the automotive press, but British Leyland Motor Corporation was reportedly concerned that the MGB GT V8 would overshadow their other products, including the more expensive and less powerful  Triumph Stag .       [ edit ]   RV8     MG RV8           Production   1993-1995  2000 made       Body style(s)   2 seat sports/racer       Engine(s)   3946 cc  Rover   V8       Interest in small roadsters increased in the 1990s following the introduction of the  Mazda MX-5 , and MG (now owned by  Rover Group ) capitalized on this in 1992 by producing new body panels to create an updated version of the old car. The suspension was only slightly updated, sharing the old leaf sprung rear of the MGB. The boot lid and doors were shared with the original car, as were the rear drum brakes. However, the engine was the respected aluminum  Rover V8 , previously used in the MGB GT V8. A  limited-slip differential  was also fitted.   The interior was built to luxury standards, featuring  veneered  burr  elm  woodwork and  Connolly Leather . [ 4 ]   Performance was good, with 190 bhp (142 kW) at 4,750 rpm and 060 mph (96 km/h) in 5.9 s. Largely due to the rear drum brakes and rear leaf springs (perceived to be too old fashioned for a modern performance car), the RV8 was not popular with road testers at the time. However, this did not prevent the RV8 from being a moderate sales success, and it paved the way for the introduction of the modern  MGF  a few years later.   It also capitalized on an interest in British products in  Japan . A sizeable chunk of MG RV8 production went to that country.       [ edit ]   Racing performance     [ edit ]   Overall or class wins   The MGB was highly successful in international road competition events such as the  Monte Carlo Rally . In 1964 it won the GT category,  Sebring , the Spa 1000 km and the 1963, 1964 and 1965  Le Mans 24 hour  beating more powerful cars in the process.

(a href=""/exec/link.asp?658"">46.2-100)  Trailers can be registered annually, bi-annually or permanently.  The  trailer registration fee  is based on the gross weight of the trailer and the registration period selected. Insurance coverage for trailers depend on the  insurance  coverage of the vehicle pulling the trailer.   Check the Virginia State Police Website for safety  inspection requirements  .     A publication highlighting trailer safety tips entitled "" Towing a Trailer: Being Equipped for Safety "" is available through The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.     Permanent License Plates for Trailers     Permanent license plates are available for all private, for-hire and rental trailers, regardless of their weight, for a one-time fee.   A registration card will be issued for a trailer with permanent plates.   The license plate will not have a month and year decal unless it is on a rental trailer, nor will it have a month or year expiration.  Plates are embossed with the word ""Permanent"".  For trailers that have a gross weight of 4,000 pounds or less, you may choose a full size or small (motorcycle size) permanent license plate.   Permanent trailer plates for rental trailers will display an orange decal with a white ""R"" to designate the trailer as a rental.   There is no additional registration fee for as long as you own the trailer.  If ownership changes new plates will have to be purchased.   To order permanent plates, complete a  VSA-14  ""Application for Registration"" and check ""permanent"" for registration type.    Personalized messages are available for an additional one-time fee.  Permanent plates are neither transferable nor refundable.   If your permanent plate is lost, mutilated or illegible it can be replaced for a fee.  (a href=""/exec/link.asp?730"">46.2-692)       Local Vehicle Registration Program     DMV also collects the local vehicle registration fee for localities that participate in the  Local Vehicle Registration Program .

With not one, but two Ford pickup factories churning out almost equal numbers of F-Series trucks and UAW loyalists, having a Toyota pickup in the driveway can be asking for trouble. We were prepared for the worst when the bright red 2007 Nissan Titan arrived. Not only does this truck have the wrong badge for the Buy American crowd, but it's not shy, either. The Titan is tall and proud, with bold styling and lots of chrome up front. The big 5.6 liter V8 under the hood is far from subtle, too. So it was only a matter of time before someone noticed the thing. I was only a few miles from home when a white Ford F-150 pulled alongside with a man who looked like a retired autoworker behind the wheel.   He waved at me, to get my attention. I pretended not to notice, and he waved again. Steeling myself for the coming abuse, I finally made eye contact, and he gave me a thumbs-up and a big smile. Unlike the Honda Ridgeline and Toyota Tundra, the Titan seems to have had no trouble crossing the Buy American border. For 2007, flexible-fuel capability and a slight horsepower boost keep it up to date.     As it turned out, our big, in-your-face Nissan had no trouble making friends in the Motor City. ""Your truck is beautiful!"" a woman in a Ford Econoline rolled down her window to shout as we drove past. The Titan is a tall, broad-shouldered truck, with blocky, chiseled lines that stand out. It looks the part of a Tough Truck. The design hides a practical heart as well; the tall seating position and cutaway front fenders improve visibility to the front. The cargo box is also as much about utility as styling; there's a small, water-resistant cargo bin just aft of the left rear wheel, and a built-in adjustable cargo tiedown rack is standard equipment. The Titan also features a standard spray-on bedliner and an available power rear window in crew cab models.     The rugged good looks carry over to the interior, which stands out from the classic pickup-truck cabin with an abundance of strong horizontal and vertical surfaces, high-shouldered door panels and a tall center console. The cab is spacious, with plenty of head- and shoulder-room. Adjustable pedals make this big truck comfortable for a variety of drivers. Legroom in the crew cab rivals that of the ""super-size"" cabs available from other manufacturers, with over 40 inches of legroom. The rear seats also fold flat, opening up generous space inside the cab for cargo--enough for an antique bureau, as it turned out. Additional storage space is provided in the available overhead console. The décor involves perhaps too much gray plastic, but that just makes it easy to keep clean. The Titan's interior layout is artistic, and right on the border between too gimmicky and practical. I found myself hunting for switchgear even after spending a few days with the truck. My only major complaint was that the sideview mirrors are too small for trailer towing.     The Titan arrived on the day that I had to tow the old Chevrolet pickup I'm restoring home from the paint shop, so it wasn't long before its workin' skills were put to the test. At the trailer rental shop, the load-in guys (who always check out the trucks I bring in) thought it was a good-looking rig, too. We hooked up a 2000-pound car hauler, and the Titan's 5.6 liter V8 specs barely even noticed the load. Horsepower has been boosted to 317 for 2007 thanks to changes to the intake system. With the old Chevy loaded, total trailer weight was about 6000 pounds, well within the Titan's 9400-pound towing capacity. The five-speed automatic transmission handles the additional work of getting a trailer up to speed smoothly well, though Nissan's typical twitch throttle made for a few jerky starts. Once underway, whether laden or not, the Titan's drivetrain is strong and confident, with just the right amount of toughness for a proper full-size truck. The available flex-fuel version will accept blends of ethanol and gasoline in a common tank, to enable buyers to take advantage of renewable domestic fuels where available.     There's a typical pickup truck solid axle at the rear, but up front, a carlike double wishbone suspension offers relatively nimble handling. The chassis is also up to the task of handling heavy loads; the sturdy fully boxed frame riding underneath is comparable to what's found under many 3/4 ton pickups. Lateral stability was good, even with a heavy trailer out back. The standard anti-lock brakes brought all of that weight to a stop with ease. All-wheel drive is available, of course; our Titan's shift-on-the-fly 4x4 made short work of slippery late-winter roads. Nissan continues to offer the Off-Road package as well, and Titans that are going to see serious off-road duty will benefit from the lower gearing, locking rear differential, skid plates and larger off-road tires.     It's not hard to see why the Titan gets more respect than Toyota's Tundra; the styling is tough, and the truck is able to back up those rugged looks with a serious work ethic. Nissan knew all along what Toyota has only just discovered; a full-size truck has to look big and work big to get the attention of American truck buyers, and it made sure that the Titan has the right stuff. The powerful 5.6 liter V8, flexible-fuel capability and a born-to-work attitude put the Titan right in the heart of the personal-use pickup truck market. Titan pricing starts at $23,700 for a basic King Cab model and $26,550 for the Crew Cab. Our test truck was an all-wheel drive Crew Cab with XM satellite radio, the off-road package, towing package, DVD entertainment system and a thumpin' Rockford Fosgate sound system, and it stickered for $38,725.

The moment one walks through the doors at German Master Tech in Bend, Oregon, its meticulously kept, white floored shop currently home to an impressive lineup of detail and restoration in progress: the bright silver Porsche spec racer being built in the center of the room, the Porsche 911 S undergoing a full restoration and the variant of others, from BMWs to Ferraris, it is quickly understood why German Master Tech, with some of the finest European auto technicians and restoration specialists in the country, supports some of the finest European cars on the West Coast. This German-apprenticed, master-trained company, that refers to its work as a craft, is known to many by the unmatched service and support they provide their racing and restoration clients across the country, to others by the niche expedition preparation service they provide all-terrain vehicles, and still to their most dedicated customer, the fine European car enthusiast, German Master Tech is truly the one to many in this town.  German Master Techs President, a BMW Master Technician, Tim Morris, brings with him over 25 years experience in the industry and has been awarded several achievement and master technician status awards though BMW specialized factory schools. Tim has also achieved BMWs Center of Excellence Award twice and is a seven-time BMW Presidents Club Technician. German Master Techs co-founder and past partner, Jay Audia, won the 07 SCCA Regional Championships for GT2 in his German Master Tech-prepared Panoz. The companys third founder is one of Bends most passionate Porsche enthusiasts, John Audette.  Restorations have been a large part of our focus, said Morris, describing some of his companys award winning roots. From our very first restoration, a 58 BMW Isetta 300, which we took to the Forest Grove Concours d Elegance in 05 and won our class, in addition to taking home the Presidents Award, which was judged by Pacific Colleges President as the car the college student would most want to drive, said Morris. I drew on my past car show and restoration experience to pull off a surprise win. It was a good deal of timing and the right car, with the right colors. We stole the show with a micro car, it was great! Morris said standing next to his red Porsche hot rod parked inside his shop. Car shows and racing are my passions, he said with a smile. Our tuning business is the best around, continued Morris of the companys capabilities. The application of our developed performance packages to already great cars really creates a wow. German Master Tech provides full warranty BMW performance upgrades as a Dinan-authorized dealer, and Porsche performance programs that take the 911 to the next level. Our tuning business has led us to organized racing, which has been a life-long dream of mine. Included in German Master Techs list of champion racing cars are a 64 BMW 1800 TISA owned by Steve Walker of Salem. The 1800 TISA is BMWs first post-war racer based on a production car in regional vintage racing. A 911 Porsche racer owned by Bends Mark Powell will be racing in one of the West Coasts fastest growing amateur racing classes, Spec 911. Marks car is special as it ties together the whole business: a restoration with an extreme tuning package. German Master Tech has worked on all my cars, including a Range Rover, BMW, three Ferraris and a Porsche, said Ervin Richards, a long-time German Master Tech customer. I bring my cars here because they consistently do it better and because theyve always gone way beyond the call of duty in their service and support of my vehicles. If I can bring it to German Master Tech, said Richards, I will. To learn more about German Master Tech, contact them directly at 541.322.9647.

With not one, but two Ford pickup factories churning out almost equal numbers of F-Series trucks and UAW loyalists, having a Toyota pickup in the driveway can be asking for trouble. We were prepared for the worst when the bright red 2007 Nissan Titan arrived. Not only does this truck have the wrong badge for the Buy American crowd, but it's not shy, either. The Titan is tall and proud, with bold styling and lots of chrome up front. The big 5.6 liter V8 under the hood is far from subtle, too. So it was only a matter of time before someone noticed the thing. I was only a few miles from home when a white Ford F-150 pulled alongside with a man who looked like a retired autoworker behind the wheel.   He waved at me, to get my attention. I pretended not to notice, and he waved again. Steeling myself for the coming abuse, I finally made eye contact, and he gave me a thumbs-up and a big smile. Unlike the Honda Ridgeline and Toyota Tundra, the Titan seems to have had no trouble crossing the Buy American border. For 2007, flexible-fuel capability and a slight horsepower boost keep it up to date.     As it turned out, our big, in-your-face Nissan had no trouble making friends in the Motor City. ""Your truck is beautiful!"" a woman in a Ford Econoline rolled down her window to shout as we drove past. The Titan is a tall, broad-shouldered truck, with blocky, chiseled lines that stand out. It looks the part of a Tough Truck. The design hides a practical heart as well; the tall seating position and cutaway front fenders improve visibility to the front. The cargo box is also as much about utility as styling; there's a small, water-resistant cargo bin just aft of the left rear wheel, and a built-in adjustable cargo tiedown rack is standard equipment. The Titan also features a standard spray-on bedliner and an available power rear window in crew cab models.     The rugged good looks carry over to the interior, which stands out from the classic pickup-truck cabin with an abundance of strong horizontal and vertical surfaces, high-shouldered door panels and a tall center console. The cab is spacious, with plenty of head- and shoulder-room. Adjustable pedals make this big truck comfortable for a variety of drivers. Legroom in the crew cab rivals that of the ""super-size"" cabs available from other manufacturers, with over 40 inches of legroom. The rear seats also fold flat, opening up generous space inside the cab for cargo--enough for an antique bureau, as it turned out. Additional storage space is provided in the available overhead console. The décor involves perhaps too much gray plastic, but that just makes it easy to keep clean. The Titan's interior layout is artistic, and right on the border between too gimmicky and practical. I found myself hunting for switchgear even after spending a few days with the truck. My only major complaint was that the sideview mirrors are too small for trailer towing.     The Titan arrived on the day that I had to tow the old Chevrolet pickup I'm restoring home from the paint shop, so it wasn't long before its workin' skills were put to the test. At the trailer rental shop, the load-in guys (who always check out the trucks I bring in) thought it was a good-looking rig, too. We hooked up a 2000-pound car hauler, and the Titan's 5.6 liter V8 specs barely even noticed the load. Horsepower has been boosted to 317 for 2007 thanks to changes to the intake system. With the old Chevy loaded, total trailer weight was about 6000 pounds, well within the Titan's 9400-pound towing capacity. The five-speed automatic transmission handles the additional work of getting a trailer up to speed smoothly well, though Nissan's typical twitch throttle made for a few jerky starts. Once underway, whether laden or not, the Titan's drivetrain is strong and confident, with just the right amount of toughness for a proper full-size truck. The available flex-fuel version will accept blends of ethanol and gasoline in a common tank, to enable buyers to take advantage of renewable domestic fuels where available.     There's a typical pickup truck solid axle at the rear, but up front, a carlike double wishbone suspension offers relatively nimble handling. The chassis is also up to the task of handling heavy loads; the sturdy fully boxed frame riding underneath is comparable to what's found under many 3/4 ton pickups. Lateral stability was good, even with a heavy trailer out back. The standard anti-lock brakes brought all of that weight to a stop with ease. All-wheel drive is available, of course; our Titan's shift-on-the-fly 4x4 made short work of slippery late-winter roads. Nissan continues to offer the Off-Road package as well, and Titans that are going to see serious off-road duty will benefit from the lower gearing, locking rear differential, skid plates and larger off-road tires.     It's not hard to see why the Titan gets more respect than Toyota's Tundra; the styling is tough, and the truck is able to back up those rugged looks with a serious work ethic. Nissan knew all along what Toyota has only just discovered; a full-size truck has to look big and work big to get the attention of American truck buyers, and it made sure that the Titan has the right stuff. The powerful 5.6 liter V8, flexible-fuel capability and a born-to-work attitude put the Titan right in the heart of the personal-use pickup truck market. Titan pricing starts at $23,700 for a basic King Cab model and $26,550 for the Crew Cab. Our test truck was an all-wheel drive Crew Cab with XM satellite radio, the off-road package, towing package, DVD entertainment system and a thumpin' Rockford Fosgate sound system, and it stickered for $38,725.

Bobcatcompact excavators with advanced hydraulic systems can often outperform larger tractor loader backhoes, which are limited to only 180 degrees of workgroup movement. The house on a Bobcat compact excavator can continuously rotate 360 degrees. This allows for enhanced spoil placement, superior visibility and reduces repositioning for work in tighter spaces. A tracked undercarriage gives you additional benefits like superior flotation compared to a wheeled machine. Also, compact excavators use less fuel and can be hauled with lighter, more fuel-efficient trucks, keeping your hourly costs down.                                                                                              Independent boom swing Provides offset digging capabilities, enabling you to dig square holes, or on each side of a buried utility without repositioning the machine. Try that without repositioning your backhoe!

On a tractor loader backhoe, you have to lean around the boom to see the attachment.
