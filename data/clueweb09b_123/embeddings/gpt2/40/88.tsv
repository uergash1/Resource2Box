There was no common myth to this Greek god of the sky who ruled over the day and night sky including the stars. He apparently could not bear the sight of his children, the Titans, the one-eyed Cyclopes (SI klo peesz) and those with 50 heads and 100 arms, and hid them deep in the Earth. Gaia didn't like that so she caused a rebellion against Uranus which left him maimed and powerless. Cronus, a Titan, became the ruler of the universe only to be deposed later by Zeus.  Uranus Facts            Neptune     Neptune, Poseidon (po SI duhn) for the Greeks, was god over the seas and by using his trident (a spear with 3 points like a fork) he brought forth storms, hurricanes, and tides. He also controlled earthquakes.  Neptune Facts       Pluto     Pluto or Hades (HEY deez) ruled the underworld. He stole Persephone (pur SEF uh nee), the daughter of Demeter (dih MEE tur) the grain goddess, to be his wife. This angered the goddess and crops withered and failed. Through a compromise, the daughter spent only four months with Hades and while she was gone no crops grew which corresponded to winter.   The Cap of Hades made anyone who wore it invisible. This cap and a polished shield helped Perseus (PUR see uhs) to slay Medusa (muh DOO suh), the evil Gorgon woman, who had snakes for hair and turned you into stone if you looked directly at her.

September 2007 (13:44) |  Uranus & Neptun  |  Keine Kommentare       Astronomers who were making temperature maps of Neptune discovered that the region around the south pole is hotter than the rest of the planet. Why? Neptune has a year that is 165 Earth years long and the south pole of the planet is currently tilted towards the sun.  A Warm South Pole? Yes, on Neptune!

August 2007 (04:15) |  Uranus & Neptun  |  Keine Kommentare       A new series of images from the Hubble Space Telescope, the Keck II telescope, and ESO’s Very Large Telescope shows how the ring system around the distant planet Uranus appears at ever more oblique tilts as viewed from Earth - culminating in the rings being seen edge-on in three observing opportunities in 2007.

Welcome to Planets.net                                                                                                                                                                                                               A planet, as defined by the International Astronomical                              Union (IAU), is a celestial body orbiting a star or                              stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded                              by its own gravity, not massive enough to cause thermonuclear                              fusion in its core, and has cleared its neighbouring                              region of planetesimals                              The term planet is an ancient one, with ties to                              history, science, myth and religion. The planets were                              originally seen as a divine presence; as emissaries                              of the gods. Even today, many people continue to believe                              the movement of the planets affects their lives, although                              such a causation is rejected by the scientific community.                              As scientific knowledge improved, the human perception                              of the planets changed over time, incorporating a                              number of disparate objects. Even now there is no                              uncontested definition of what a planet is. In 2006,                              the IAU officially adopted a resolution defining planets                              within the Solar System. This definition has been                              both praised and criticised, and remains disputed                              by some scientists.                              Since the dawn of the space age, close observation                              by probes has found that Earth and the other planets                              share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes,                              tectonics and even hydrology. Since 1992, and the                              discovery of hundreds of extrasolar planets, scientists                              are beginning to observe similar features across the                              galaxy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Solar System                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Solar System or solar system[a]                                    consists of the Sun and the other celestial                                    objects gravitationally bound to it: the eight                                    planets, their 165 known moons,[1] three dwarf                                    planets (Ceres, Pluto, and Eris and their four                                    known moons), and billions of small bodies.

Beyond                                    the Kuiper belt lies the scattered disc, the                                    heliopause, and ultimately the hypothetical                                    Oort cloud.

The story is serialized in  The Atlantic Monthly , starting in 1869. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  The idea surfaces again in  Jules Verne 's  The Begum's Millions  (1879).   In 1903  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  (18571935) published      ( The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices ), which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch  spacecraft . He calculated the  orbital speed  required for a minimal  orbit  around the Earth at 8 km/s, and that a  multi-stage rocket  fueled by liquid  propellants  could be used to achieve this. He proposed the use of  liquid hydrogen  and  liquid oxygen , though other combinations can be used.   In 1928 Slovenian  Herman Potonik  (18921929) published his sole book,  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-Motor  ( The Problem of Space Travel  The Rocket Motor ), a plan for a breakthrough into space and a permanent human presence there. He conceived of a space station in detail and calculated its  geostationary orbit . He described the use of orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments. The book described geostationary satellites (first put forward by Tsiolkovsky) and discussed communication between them and the ground using radio, but fell short of the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays.   In a 1945  Wireless World  article the English science fiction writer  Arthur C. Clarke  (1917-2008) described in detail the possible use of  communications satellites  for mass communications. [ 3 ]  Clarke examined the logistics of satellite launch, possible  orbits  and other aspects of the creation of a network of world-circling satellites, pointing to the benefits of high-speed global communications. He also suggested that three  geostationary  satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet.     [ edit ]   History of artificial satellites   Further information:  Timeline of artificial satellites and space probes   See also:  Space Race   The first artificial satellite was  Sputnik 1 , launched by the  Soviet Union  on 4 October 1957, and initiating the  Soviet   Sputnik program , with  Sergei Korolev  as chief designer and  Kerim Kerimov  as his assistant. [ 4 ]  This in turn triggered the  Space Race  between the  Soviet Union  and the  United States .   Sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high  atmospheric layers  through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on  radio -signal distribution in the  ionosphere . Because the satellite's body was filled with pressurized  nitrogen ,  Sputnik 1  also provided the first opportunity for  meteoroid  detection, as a loss of internal pressure due to meteoroid penetration of the outer surface would have been evident in the temperature data sent back to Earth. The unanticipated announcement of  Sputnik 1' s success precipitated the  Sputnik crisis  in the  United States  and ignited the so-called  Space Race  within the  Cold War .   Sputnik 2  was launched on November 3, 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit, a  dog  named  Laika . [ 5 ]   In May, 1946,  Project RAND  had released the  Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship , which stated, ""A satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the Twentieth Century. [ 6 ]  The  United States  had been considering launching  orbital  satellites since 1945 under the  Bureau of Aeronautics  of the  United States Navy . The  United States Air Force 's Project RAND eventually released the above report, but did not believe that the satellite was a potential military weapon; rather, they considered it to be a tool for science, politics, and propaganda. In 1954, the Secretary of Defense stated, ""I know of no American satellite program."" [ 7 ]   On July 29, 1955, the  White House  announced that the U.S. intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as  Project Vanguard . On July 31, the Soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.   Following pressure by the  American Rocket Society , the  National Science Foundation , and the  International Geophysical Year , military interest picked up and in early 1955 the Air Force and Navy were working on  Project Orbiter , which involved using a  Jupiter C rocket  to launch a satellite. The project succeeded, and  Explorer 1  became the United States' first satellite on January 31, 1958. [ 8 ]   In June 1961, three-and-a-half years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the Air Force used resources of the  United States Space Surveillance Network  to catalog 115 Earth-orbiting satellites. [ 9 ]   The largest artificial satellite currently orbiting the Earth is the  International Space Station .     [ edit ]   Space Surveillance Network   The  United States Space Surveillance Network  (SSN) has been tracking space objects since 1957 when the Soviets opened the space age with the launch of Sputnik I. Since then, the SSN has tracked more than 26,000 space objects orbiting Earth. The SSN currently tracks more than 8,000 man-made orbiting objects. The rest have re-entered Earth's turbulent atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted the Earth. The space objects now orbiting Earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds. About seven percent of the space objects are operational satellites (i.e. ~560 satellites), the rest are  space debris . [ 10 ]   USSTRATCOM  is primarily interested in the active satellites, but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles. The SSN tracks space objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter (baseball size) or larger.     [ edit ]   Non-Military Satellite Services   There are three basic categories of non-military satellite services: [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Fixed Satellite Service   Fixed satellite services  handle hundreds of billions of voice, data, and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earths surface.     [ edit ]   Mobile Satellite Systems   Mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions, vehicles, ships, people and aircraft to other parts of the world and/or other mobile or stationary communications units, in addition to serving as navigation systems.     [ edit ]   Scientific Research Satellite (commercial and noncommercial)   Scientific research satellites provide us with meteorological information, land survey data (e.g., remote sensing), and other different scientific research applications such as earth science, marine science, and atmospheric research.     [ edit ]   Types           MILSTAR : A communication satellite         Anti-Satellite weapons/""Killer Satellites""  are satellites that are armed, designed to take out enemy warheads, satellites, other space assets. They may have particle weapons, energy weapons, kinetic weapons, nuclear and/or conventional missiles and/or a combination of these weapons.   Astronomical satellites  are satellites used for observation of distant planets, galaxies, and other outer space objects.   Biosatellites  are satellites designed to carry living organisms, generally for scientific experimentation.   Communications satellites  are satellites stationed in space for the purpose of  telecommunications . Modern communications satellites typically use  geosynchronous orbits ,  Molniya orbits  or  Low Earth orbits .   Miniaturized satellites  are satellites of unusually low weights and small sizes. [ 12 ]  New classifications are used to categorize these satellites: minisatellite (500200 kg), microsatellite (below 200 kg), nanosatellite (below 10 kg).   Navigational satellites  are satellites which use  radio  time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location. The relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground, combined with ever-improving electronics, allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time.   Reconnaissance satellites  are  Earth observation satellite  or  communications satellite  deployed for  military  or  intelligence  applications. Little is known about the full power of these satellites, as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classified.   Earth observation satellites  are satellites intended for non-military uses such as  environmental  monitoring,  meteorology ,  map making  etc. (See especially  Earth Observing System .)   Space stations  are man-made structures that are designed for  human beings  to live on in  outer space . A space station is distinguished from other manned  spacecraft  by its lack of major  propulsion  or  landing  facilities  instead, other vehicles are used as transport to and from the station. Space stations are designed for medium-term living in  orbit , for periods of  weeks ,  months , or even  years .   Tether satellites  are satellites which are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a  tether .   Weather satellites  are primarily used to monitor  Earth 's  weather  and  climate . [ 13 ]       [ edit ]   Orbit types             It has been suggested that this article or section be  merged  into  List of orbits . ( Discuss )       Main article:  List of orbits          Various earth orbits to scale; cyan represents low earth orbit, yellow represents medium earth orbit, the black dashed line represents geosynchronous orbit, the green dash-dot line the orbit of  Global Positioning System  (GPS) satellites, and the red dotted line the orbit of the  International Space Station  (ISS).       The first satellite,  Sputnik 1 , was put into orbit around  Earth  and was therefore in  geocentric orbit . By far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 2456 artificial satellites orbiting the  Earth . Geocentric orbits may be further classified by their  altitude ,  inclination  and  eccentricity .   The commonly used altitude classifications are  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO),  Medium Earth Orbit  (MEO) and  High Earth Orbit  (HEO). Low Earth orbit is any orbit below 2000 km, and Medium Earth Orbit is any orbit higher than that but still below the altitude for  geosynchronous orbit  at 35786 km. High Earth Orbit is any orbit higher than the altitude for geosynchronous orbit.     [ edit ]   Centric classifications     Galactocentric orbit : An orbit about the center of a  galaxy .  Earth 's  sun  follows this type of orbit about the  galactic center  of the  Milky Way .   Heliocentric orbit : An  orbit  around the  Sun . In our  Solar System , all  planets ,  comets , and  asteroids  are in such orbits, as are many artificial satellites and pieces of  space debris .  Moons  by contrast are not in a  heliocentric orbit  but rather orbit their parent planet.   Geocentric orbit : An orbit around the planet  Earth , such as the  Moon  or  artificial satellites . Currently there are approximately 2465 artificial satellites orbiting the  Earth .   Areocentric orbit : An orbit around the planet  Mars , such as  moons  or  artificial satellites .       [ edit ]   Altitude classifications     Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) :  Geocentric orbits  ranging in altitude from 02000  km  (01240  miles )   Medium Earth Orbit  (MEO) :  Geocentric orbits  ranging in altitude from 2000  km  (1240  miles ) to just below  geosynchronous orbit  at 35786  km  (22240  miles ). Also known as an  intermediate circular orbit .   High Earth Orbit  (HEO) :  Geocentric orbits  above the altitude of  geosynchronous orbit  35786  km  (22240  miles ).            Orbital Altitudes of several significant satellites of earth.         [ edit ]   Inclination classifications     Inclined orbit : An orbit whose  inclination  in reference to the  equatorial plane  is not zero degrees.    Polar orbit : An  orbit  that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution. Therefore it has an  inclination  of (or very close to) 90  degrees .   Polar  sun synchronous orbit : A nearly  polar orbit  that passes the  equator  at the same local time on every pass. Useful for  image  taking satellites because  shadows  will be nearly the same on every pass.           [ edit ]   Eccentricity classifications     Circular orbit : An  orbit  that has an  eccentricity  of 0 and whose path traces a  circle .    Hohmann transfer orbit : An orbital maneuver that moves a  spacecraft  from one  circular orbit  to another using two engine  impulses . This maneuver was named after  Walter Hohmann .       Elliptic orbit : An  orbit  with an  eccentricity  greater than 0 and less than 1 whose orbit traces the path of an  ellipse .    Geosynchronous transfer orbit : An  elliptic orbit  where the  perigee  is at the  altitude  of a  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) and the  apogee  at the  altitude  of a  geosynchronous orbit .   Geostationary transfer orbit : An  elliptic orbit  where the  perigee  is at the  altitude  of a  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) and the  apogee  at the  altitude  of a  geostationary orbit .   Molniya orbit : A highly  elliptic orbit  with  inclination  of 63.4 and  orbital period  of half of a  sidereal day  (roughly 12 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a designated area of the  planet .   Tundra orbit : A highly  elliptic orbit  with  inclination  of 63.4 and  orbital period  of one  sidereal day  (roughly 24 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a designated area of the  planet .       Hyperbolic orbit : An  orbit  with the eccentricity greater than 1. Such an orbit also has a  velocity  in excess of the  escape velocity  and as such, will escape the gravitational pull of the  planet  and continue to travel  infinitely .   Parabolic orbit : An  orbit  with the eccentricity equal to 1. Such an orbit also has a  velocity  equal to the  escape velocity  and therefore will escape the gravitational pull of the  planet  and travel until its  velocity   relative  to the  planet  is 0. If the speed of such an orbit is increased it will become a  hyperbolic orbit .    Escape orbit  (EO) : A high-speed  parabolic orbit  where the object has  escape velocity  and is moving away from the  planet .   Capture orbit : A high-speed  parabolic orbit  where the object has  escape velocity  and is moving toward the  planet .           [ edit ]   Synchronous classifications     Synchronous orbit : An orbit where the satellite has an  orbital period  equal to the average  rotational period  (earth's is: 23  hours , 56  minutes , 4.091  seconds ) of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body. To a ground observer such a satellite would trace an  analemma  (figure 8) in the sky.   Semi-synchronous orbit  (SSO) : An  orbit  with an  altitude  of approximately 20200 km (12544.2 miles) and an  orbital period  equal to one-half of the average  rotational period  (earth's is approximately 12 hours) of the body being orbited   Geosynchronous orbit  (GEO) : Orbits with an altitude of approximately 35786 km (22240 miles). Such a satellite would trace an  analemma  (figure 8) in the sky.    Geostationary orbit  (GSO) : A  geosynchronous orbit  with an  inclination  of zero. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky. [ 14 ]     Clarke orbit : Another name for a  geostationary orbit . Named after scientist and writer  Arthur C. Clarke .       Supersynchronous orbit : A disposal / storage orbit above GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift west. Also a  synonym  for Disposal orbit.   Subsynchronous orbit : A drift orbit close to but below GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift east.   Graveyard orbit : An orbit a few hundred kilometers above  geosynchronous  that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation.    Disposal orbit : A  synonym  for  graveyard orbit .   Junk orbit : A  synonym  for  graveyard orbit .           Areosynchronous orbit : A  synchronous orbit  around the planet  Mars  with an  orbital period  equal in length to Mars'  sidereal day , 24.6229  hours .   Areostationary orbit  (ASO) : A  circular   areosynchronous orbit  on the  equatorial plane  and about 17000  km (10557  miles ) above the surface. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.   Heliosynchronous orbit : An  heliocentric orbit  about the  Sun  where the satellite's  orbital period  matches the  Sun 's period of  rotation . These orbits occur at a radius of 24,360  Gm  (0,1628  AU ) around the  Sun , a little less than half of the  orbital radius  of  Mercury .       [ edit ]   Special classifications     Sun-synchronous orbit : An orbit which combines  altitude  and  inclination  in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the  planets 's surface at the same local  solar time . Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for  imaging ,  spy , and  weather satellites .   Moon orbit : The  orbital characteristics  of  earth 's  moon . Average  altitude  of 384403 kilometres (238857 mi),  elliptical - inclined orbit .       [ edit ]   Pseudo-orbit classifications     Horseshoe orbit : An  orbit  that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a certain  planet  but is actually in  co-orbit  with the  planet . See asteroids  3753  (Cruithne) and  2002 AA 29 .   Exo-orbit : A maneuver where a  spacecraft  approaches the height of  orbit  but lacks the  velocity  to sustain it.    Suborbital spaceflight : A  synonym  for  exo-orbit .       Lunar transfer orbit  (LTO)   Prograde orbit : An  orbit  with an inclination of less than 90. Or rather, an orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary.   Retrograde orbit : An  orbit  with an  inclination  of more than 90. Or rather, an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet. Apart from those in  sun-synchronous orbit , few satellites are launched into  retrograde orbit  because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a  prograde orbit . This is because when the rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of  velocity  equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch  latitude .   Halo orbit  and  Lissajous orbit : Orbits ""around""  Lagrangian points .       [ edit ]   Satellite Modules   The satellites functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics. Looking at the anatomy of a typical satellite, one discovers two modules. [ 11 ]  Note that some novel architectural concepts such as  Fractionated Spacecraft  somewhat upset this taxonomy.     [ edit ]   Spacecraft bus or service module   This first module consist of five subsystems:     The Structural Subsystems     The structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure, shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage, and controls the satellites spin functions.     The Telemetry Subsystems     The telemetry subsystem monitors the on-board equipment operations, transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station, and receives the earth control stations commands to perform equipment operation adjustments.     The Power Subsystems     The power subsystem consists of solar panels and backup batteries that generate power when the satellite passes into the earths shadow. Nuclear power sources ( Radioisotope thermoelectric generator 's) have been used in several successful satellite programs including the  Nimbus program  (1964-1978). [ 15 ]     The Thermal Control Subsystems     The thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellites body (e.g.  Optical Solar Reflector )     The Attitude and Orbit Controlled Control Subsystems     Main article:  Attitude control   The attitude and orbit controlled subsystem consists of small rocket thrusters that keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas positioning in the right directions.     [ edit ]   Communication Payload   The second major module is the communication payload, which is made up of transponders. A transponders is capable of :     Receiving uplinked radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations (antennas).   Amplifying received radio signals   Sorting the input signals and directing the output signals through input/output signal multiplexers to the proper downlink antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations (antennas).       [ edit ]   Launch-capable countries   Main article:  Timeline of first orbital launches by nationality          Launch of the first  British   Skynet  military satellite.       This list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit, including production of the necessary launch vehicle. Note: many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites  which relatively speaking, does not require much economic, scientific and industrial capacity  but are unable to launch them, instead relying on foreign launch services. This list does not consider those numerous countries, but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously, and the date this capability was first demonstrated. Does not include consortium satellites or multi-national satellites.

North Korea  (1998) and  Iraq  (1989) have claimed orbital launches (satellite and warhead accordingly), but these claims are unconfirmed.   In addition to the above, countries such as  South Africa ,  Spain ,  Italy ,  Germany ,  Canada ,  Australia ,  Argentina ,  Egypt  and private companies such as  OTRAG , have developed their own launchers, but have not had a successful launch.   As of 2009, only eight countries from the list above (  Russia  and  Ukraine  instead of  USSR , also  USA ,  Japan ,  China ,  India ,  Israel  and  Iran ) and one regional organization (the  European Space Agency , ESA) have independently launched satellites on their own indigenously developed launch vehicles. (The launch capabilities of the  United Kingdom  and  France  now fall under the  ESA .)   Several other countries, including  South Korea ,  Brazil ,  Pakistan ,  Romania ,  Taiwan ,  Indonesia ,  Kazakhstan ,  Australia ,  Malaysia [ citation needed ]  and  Turkey , are at various stages of development of their own small-scale launcher capabilities.   It is scheduled that in summer or autumn of 2009  South Korea  will launch a  KSLV  rocket (created with assistance of Russia).     [ edit ]   Launch capable private entities   On September 28th, 2008, the private aerospace firm SpaceX successfully launched its Falcon 1 rocket in to orbit. This marked the first time that a privately built liquid-fueled booster was able to reach orbit. [ 16 ]  The rocket carried a prism shaped 1.5 m (5 ft) long payload mass simulator that was set into orbit. The dummy satellite, known as Ratsat, will remain in orbit for between five and ten years before burning up in the atmosphere.

The first Italian-launched was  San Marco 1 , launched on 15 December 1964 on a U.S.  Scout rocket  from Wallops Island (VA,USA) with an Italian Launch Team trained by NASA. [ 20 ]  Australia's launch project ( WRESAT ) involved a donated U.S. missile and U. S. support staff as well as a joint launch facility with the  United Kingdom . [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Attacks on satellites   For more details on this topic, see  Anti-satellite weapon .   In recent times satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   Satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth.  Russia , the  United States  and  China  have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites. [ 24 ]  In 2007 the  Chinese  military shot down an aging weather satellite, [ 24 ]  followed by the  US Navy  shooting down a  defunct spy satellite  in February 2008. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Jamming   Due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions they are prone to  jamming  by land-based transmitters. Such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter's range. GPS satellites are potential targets for jamming, [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming.

It is a dull blue colour, mainly       consisting of gas with a possible rocky core. Uranus has a faint ring       system and at least 27 moons orbiting it. The planet is unusual because it       orbits the Sun on its side, possibly the result of a collision during the       formation of the Solar System.

A full size model of the Earth observation satellite  ERS 2       In the context of  spaceflight , a  satellite  is an  object  which has been placed into  orbit  by  human  endeavor.

The story is serialized in  The Atlantic Monthly , starting in 1869. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  The idea surfaces again in  Jules Verne 's  The Begum's Millions  (1879).   In 1903  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  (18571935) published      ( The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices ), which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch  spacecraft . He calculated the  orbital speed  required for a minimal  orbit  around the Earth at 8 km/s, and that a  multi-stage rocket  fueled by liquid  propellants  could be used to achieve this. He proposed the use of  liquid hydrogen  and  liquid oxygen , though other combinations can be used.   In 1928 Slovenian  Herman Potonik  (18921929) published his sole book,  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-Motor  ( The Problem of Space Travel  The Rocket Motor ), a plan for a breakthrough into space and a permanent human presence there. He conceived of a space station in detail and calculated its  geostationary orbit . He described the use of orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments. The book described geostationary satellites (first put forward by Tsiolkovsky) and discussed communication between them and the ground using radio, but fell short of the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays.   In a 1945  Wireless World  article the English science fiction writer  Arthur C. Clarke  (1917-2008) described in detail the possible use of  communications satellites  for mass communications. [ 3 ]  Clarke examined the logistics of satellite launch, possible  orbits  and other aspects of the creation of a network of world-circling satellites, pointing to the benefits of high-speed global communications. He also suggested that three  geostationary  satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet.     [ edit ]   History of artificial satellites   Further information:  Timeline of artificial satellites and space probes   See also:  Space Race   The first artificial satellite was  Sputnik 1 , launched by the  Soviet Union  on 4 October 1957, and initiating the  Soviet   Sputnik program , with  Sergei Korolev  as chief designer and  Kerim Kerimov  as his assistant. [ 4 ]  This in turn triggered the  Space Race  between the  Soviet Union  and the  United States .   Sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high  atmospheric layers  through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on  radio -signal distribution in the  ionosphere . Because the satellite's body was filled with pressurized  nitrogen ,  Sputnik 1  also provided the first opportunity for  meteoroid  detection, as a loss of internal pressure due to meteoroid penetration of the outer surface would have been evident in the temperature data sent back to Earth. The unanticipated announcement of  Sputnik 1' s success precipitated the  Sputnik crisis  in the  United States  and ignited the so-called  Space Race  within the  Cold War .   Sputnik 2  was launched on November 3, 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit, a  dog  named  Laika . [ 5 ]   In May, 1946,  Project RAND  had released the  Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship , which stated, ""A satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the Twentieth Century. [ 6 ]  The  United States  had been considering launching  orbital  satellites since 1945 under the  Bureau of Aeronautics  of the  United States Navy . The  United States Air Force 's Project RAND eventually released the above report, but did not believe that the satellite was a potential military weapon; rather, they considered it to be a tool for science, politics, and propaganda. In 1954, the Secretary of Defense stated, ""I know of no American satellite program."" [ 7 ]   On July 29, 1955, the  White House  announced that the U.S. intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as  Project Vanguard . On July 31, the Soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.   Following pressure by the  American Rocket Society , the  National Science Foundation , and the  International Geophysical Year , military interest picked up and in early 1955 the Air Force and Navy were working on  Project Orbiter , which involved using a  Jupiter C rocket  to launch a satellite. The project succeeded, and  Explorer 1  became the United States' first satellite on January 31, 1958. [ 8 ]   In June 1961, three-and-a-half years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the Air Force used resources of the  United States Space Surveillance Network  to catalog 115 Earth-orbiting satellites. [ 9 ]   The largest artificial satellite currently orbiting the Earth is the  International Space Station .     [ edit ]   Space Surveillance Network   The  United States Space Surveillance Network  (SSN) has been tracking space objects since 1957 when the Soviets opened the space age with the launch of Sputnik I. Since then, the SSN has tracked more than 26,000 space objects orbiting Earth. The SSN currently tracks more than 8,000 man-made orbiting objects. The rest have re-entered Earth's turbulent atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted the Earth. The space objects now orbiting Earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds. About seven percent of the space objects are operational satellites (i.e. ~560 satellites), the rest are  space debris . [ 10 ]   USSTRATCOM  is primarily interested in the active satellites, but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles. The SSN tracks space objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter (baseball size) or larger.     [ edit ]   Non-Military Satellite Services   There are three basic categories of non-military satellite services: [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Fixed Satellite Service   Fixed satellite services  handle hundreds of billions of voice, data, and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earths surface.     [ edit ]   Mobile Satellite Systems   Mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions, vehicles, ships, people and aircraft to other parts of the world and/or other mobile or stationary communications units, in addition to serving as navigation systems.     [ edit ]   Scientific Research Satellite (commercial and noncommercial)   Scientific research satellites provide us with meteorological information, land survey data (e.g., remote sensing), and other different scientific research applications such as earth science, marine science, and atmospheric research.     [ edit ]   Types           MILSTAR : A communication satellite         Anti-Satellite weapons/""Killer Satellites""  are satellites that are armed, designed to take out enemy warheads, satellites, other space assets. They may have particle weapons, energy weapons, kinetic weapons, nuclear and/or conventional missiles and/or a combination of these weapons.   Astronomical satellites  are satellites used for observation of distant planets, galaxies, and other outer space objects.   Biosatellites  are satellites designed to carry living organisms, generally for scientific experimentation.   Communications satellites  are satellites stationed in space for the purpose of  telecommunications . Modern communications satellites typically use  geosynchronous orbits ,  Molniya orbits  or  Low Earth orbits .   Miniaturized satellites  are satellites of unusually low weights and small sizes. [ 12 ]  New classifications are used to categorize these satellites: minisatellite (500200 kg), microsatellite (below 200 kg), nanosatellite (below 10 kg).   Navigational satellites  are satellites which use  radio  time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location. The relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground, combined with ever-improving electronics, allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time.   Reconnaissance satellites  are  Earth observation satellite  or  communications satellite  deployed for  military  or  intelligence  applications. Little is known about the full power of these satellites, as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classified.   Earth observation satellites  are satellites intended for non-military uses such as  environmental  monitoring,  meteorology ,  map making  etc. (See especially  Earth Observing System .)   Space stations  are man-made structures that are designed for  human beings  to live on in  outer space . A space station is distinguished from other manned  spacecraft  by its lack of major  propulsion  or  landing  facilities  instead, other vehicles are used as transport to and from the station. Space stations are designed for medium-term living in  orbit , for periods of  weeks ,  months , or even  years .   Tether satellites  are satellites which are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a  tether .   Weather satellites  are primarily used to monitor  Earth 's  weather  and  climate . [ 13 ]       [ edit ]   Orbit types             It has been suggested that this article or section be  merged  into  List of orbits . ( Discuss )       Main article:  List of orbits          Various earth orbits to scale; cyan represents low earth orbit, yellow represents medium earth orbit, the black dashed line represents geosynchronous orbit, the green dash-dot line the orbit of  Global Positioning System  (GPS) satellites, and the red dotted line the orbit of the  International Space Station  (ISS).       The first satellite,  Sputnik 1 , was put into orbit around  Earth  and was therefore in  geocentric orbit . By far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 2456 artificial satellites orbiting the  Earth . Geocentric orbits may be further classified by their  altitude ,  inclination  and  eccentricity .   The commonly used altitude classifications are  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO),  Medium Earth Orbit  (MEO) and  High Earth Orbit  (HEO). Low Earth orbit is any orbit below 2000 km, and Medium Earth Orbit is any orbit higher than that but still below the altitude for  geosynchronous orbit  at 35786 km. High Earth Orbit is any orbit higher than the altitude for geosynchronous orbit.     [ edit ]   Centric classifications     Galactocentric orbit : An orbit about the center of a  galaxy .  Earth 's  sun  follows this type of orbit about the  galactic center  of the  Milky Way .   Heliocentric orbit : An  orbit  around the  Sun . In our  Solar System , all  planets ,  comets , and  asteroids  are in such orbits, as are many artificial satellites and pieces of  space debris .  Moons  by contrast are not in a  heliocentric orbit  but rather orbit their parent planet.   Geocentric orbit : An orbit around the planet  Earth , such as the  Moon  or  artificial satellites . Currently there are approximately 2465 artificial satellites orbiting the  Earth .   Areocentric orbit : An orbit around the planet  Mars , such as  moons  or  artificial satellites .       [ edit ]   Altitude classifications     Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) :  Geocentric orbits  ranging in altitude from 02000  km  (01240  miles )   Medium Earth Orbit  (MEO) :  Geocentric orbits  ranging in altitude from 2000  km  (1240  miles ) to just below  geosynchronous orbit  at 35786  km  (22240  miles ). Also known as an  intermediate circular orbit .   High Earth Orbit  (HEO) :  Geocentric orbits  above the altitude of  geosynchronous orbit  35786  km  (22240  miles ).            Orbital Altitudes of several significant satellites of earth.         [ edit ]   Inclination classifications     Inclined orbit : An orbit whose  inclination  in reference to the  equatorial plane  is not zero degrees.    Polar orbit : An  orbit  that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution. Therefore it has an  inclination  of (or very close to) 90  degrees .   Polar  sun synchronous orbit : A nearly  polar orbit  that passes the  equator  at the same local time on every pass. Useful for  image  taking satellites because  shadows  will be nearly the same on every pass.           [ edit ]   Eccentricity classifications     Circular orbit : An  orbit  that has an  eccentricity  of 0 and whose path traces a  circle .    Hohmann transfer orbit : An orbital maneuver that moves a  spacecraft  from one  circular orbit  to another using two engine  impulses . This maneuver was named after  Walter Hohmann .       Elliptic orbit : An  orbit  with an  eccentricity  greater than 0 and less than 1 whose orbit traces the path of an  ellipse .    Geosynchronous transfer orbit : An  elliptic orbit  where the  perigee  is at the  altitude  of a  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) and the  apogee  at the  altitude  of a  geosynchronous orbit .   Geostationary transfer orbit : An  elliptic orbit  where the  perigee  is at the  altitude  of a  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) and the  apogee  at the  altitude  of a  geostationary orbit .   Molniya orbit : A highly  elliptic orbit  with  inclination  of 63.4 and  orbital period  of half of a  sidereal day  (roughly 12 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a designated area of the  planet .   Tundra orbit : A highly  elliptic orbit  with  inclination  of 63.4 and  orbital period  of one  sidereal day  (roughly 24 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a designated area of the  planet .       Hyperbolic orbit : An  orbit  with the eccentricity greater than 1. Such an orbit also has a  velocity  in excess of the  escape velocity  and as such, will escape the gravitational pull of the  planet  and continue to travel  infinitely .   Parabolic orbit : An  orbit  with the eccentricity equal to 1. Such an orbit also has a  velocity  equal to the  escape velocity  and therefore will escape the gravitational pull of the  planet  and travel until its  velocity   relative  to the  planet  is 0. If the speed of such an orbit is increased it will become a  hyperbolic orbit .    Escape orbit  (EO) : A high-speed  parabolic orbit  where the object has  escape velocity  and is moving away from the  planet .   Capture orbit : A high-speed  parabolic orbit  where the object has  escape velocity  and is moving toward the  planet .           [ edit ]   Synchronous classifications     Synchronous orbit : An orbit where the satellite has an  orbital period  equal to the average  rotational period  (earth's is: 23  hours , 56  minutes , 4.091  seconds ) of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body. To a ground observer such a satellite would trace an  analemma  (figure 8) in the sky.   Semi-synchronous orbit  (SSO) : An  orbit  with an  altitude  of approximately 20200 km (12544.2 miles) and an  orbital period  equal to one-half of the average  rotational period  (earth's is approximately 12 hours) of the body being orbited   Geosynchronous orbit  (GEO) : Orbits with an altitude of approximately 35786 km (22240 miles). Such a satellite would trace an  analemma  (figure 8) in the sky.    Geostationary orbit  (GSO) : A  geosynchronous orbit  with an  inclination  of zero. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky. [ 14 ]     Clarke orbit : Another name for a  geostationary orbit . Named after scientist and writer  Arthur C. Clarke .       Supersynchronous orbit : A disposal / storage orbit above GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift west. Also a  synonym  for Disposal orbit.   Subsynchronous orbit : A drift orbit close to but below GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift east.   Graveyard orbit : An orbit a few hundred kilometers above  geosynchronous  that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation.    Disposal orbit : A  synonym  for  graveyard orbit .   Junk orbit : A  synonym  for  graveyard orbit .           Areosynchronous orbit : A  synchronous orbit  around the planet  Mars  with an  orbital period  equal in length to Mars'  sidereal day , 24.6229  hours .   Areostationary orbit  (ASO) : A  circular   areosynchronous orbit  on the  equatorial plane  and about 17000  km (10557  miles ) above the surface. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.   Heliosynchronous orbit : An  heliocentric orbit  about the  Sun  where the satellite's  orbital period  matches the  Sun 's period of  rotation . These orbits occur at a radius of 24,360  Gm  (0,1628  AU ) around the  Sun , a little less than half of the  orbital radius  of  Mercury .       [ edit ]   Special classifications     Sun-synchronous orbit : An orbit which combines  altitude  and  inclination  in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the  planets 's surface at the same local  solar time . Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for  imaging ,  spy , and  weather satellites .   Moon orbit : The  orbital characteristics  of  earth 's  moon . Average  altitude  of 384403 kilometres (238857 mi),  elliptical - inclined orbit .       [ edit ]   Pseudo-orbit classifications     Horseshoe orbit : An  orbit  that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a certain  planet  but is actually in  co-orbit  with the  planet . See asteroids  3753  (Cruithne) and  2002 AA 29 .   Exo-orbit : A maneuver where a  spacecraft  approaches the height of  orbit  but lacks the  velocity  to sustain it.    Suborbital spaceflight : A  synonym  for  exo-orbit .       Lunar transfer orbit  (LTO)   Prograde orbit : An  orbit  with an inclination of less than 90. Or rather, an orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary.   Retrograde orbit : An  orbit  with an  inclination  of more than 90. Or rather, an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet. Apart from those in  sun-synchronous orbit , few satellites are launched into  retrograde orbit  because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a  prograde orbit . This is because when the rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of  velocity  equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch  latitude .   Halo orbit  and  Lissajous orbit : Orbits ""around""  Lagrangian points .       [ edit ]   Satellite Modules   The satellites functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics. Looking at the anatomy of a typical satellite, one discovers two modules. [ 11 ]  Note that some novel architectural concepts such as  Fractionated Spacecraft  somewhat upset this taxonomy.     [ edit ]   Spacecraft bus or service module   This first module consist of five subsystems:     The Structural Subsystems     The structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure, shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage, and controls the satellites spin functions.     The Telemetry Subsystems     The telemetry subsystem monitors the on-board equipment operations, transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station, and receives the earth control stations commands to perform equipment operation adjustments.     The Power Subsystems     The power subsystem consists of solar panels and backup batteries that generate power when the satellite passes into the earths shadow. Nuclear power sources ( Radioisotope thermoelectric generator 's) have been used in several successful satellite programs including the  Nimbus program  (1964-1978). [ 15 ]     The Thermal Control Subsystems     The thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellites body (e.g.  Optical Solar Reflector )     The Attitude and Orbit Controlled Control Subsystems     Main article:  Attitude control   The attitude and orbit controlled subsystem consists of small rocket thrusters that keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas positioning in the right directions.     [ edit ]   Communication Payload   The second major module is the communication payload, which is made up of transponders. A transponders is capable of :     Receiving uplinked radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations (antennas).   Amplifying received radio signals   Sorting the input signals and directing the output signals through input/output signal multiplexers to the proper downlink antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations (antennas).       [ edit ]   Launch-capable countries   Main article:  Timeline of first orbital launches by nationality          Launch of the first  British   Skynet  military satellite.       This list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit, including production of the necessary launch vehicle. Note: many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites  which relatively speaking, does not require much economic, scientific and industrial capacity  but are unable to launch them, instead relying on foreign launch services. This list does not consider those numerous countries, but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously, and the date this capability was first demonstrated. Does not include consortium satellites or multi-national satellites.     First launch by country     Country   Year of first launch   First satellite         Soviet Union  (   Russia )   1957 (1992)   Sputnik 1   ( Cosmos-2175 )         United States   1958   Explorer 1         France   1965   Astrix         Japan   1970   sumi         China   1970   Dong Fang Hong I         United Kingdom   1971   Prospero X-3         India   1980   Rohini         Israel   1988   Ofeq 1         Ukraine   1995   Sich-1         Iran   2009   Omid 1       France ,  United Kingdom  and  Ukraine  launched their first satellites by own launchers from foreign  spaceports .   North Korea  (1998) and  Iraq  (1989) have claimed orbital launches (satellite and warhead accordingly), but these claims are unconfirmed.   In addition to the above, countries such as  South Africa ,  Spain ,  Italy ,  Germany ,  Canada ,  Australia ,  Argentina ,  Egypt  and private companies such as  OTRAG , have developed their own launchers, but have not had a successful launch.   As of 2009, only eight countries from the list above (  Russia  and  Ukraine  instead of  USSR , also  USA ,  Japan ,  China ,  India ,  Israel  and  Iran ) and one regional organization (the  European Space Agency , ESA) have independently launched satellites on their own indigenously developed launch vehicles. (The launch capabilities of the  United Kingdom  and  France  now fall under the  ESA .)   Several other countries, including  South Korea ,  Brazil ,  Pakistan ,  Romania ,  Taiwan ,  Indonesia ,  Kazakhstan ,  Australia ,  Malaysia [ citation needed ]  and  Turkey , are at various stages of development of their own small-scale launcher capabilities.   It is scheduled that in summer or autumn of 2009  South Korea  will launch a  KSLV  rocket (created with assistance of Russia).     [ edit ]   Launch capable private entities   On September 28th, 2008, the private aerospace firm SpaceX successfully launched its Falcon 1 rocket in to orbit. This marked the first time that a privately built liquid-fueled booster was able to reach orbit. [ 16 ]  The rocket carried a prism shaped 1.5 m (5 ft) long payload mass simulator that was set into orbit. The dummy satellite, known as Ratsat, will remain in orbit for between five and ten years before burning up in the atmosphere.

The same goes for  Australia , who launched on-board a donated  Redstone  rocket. The first Italian-launched was  San Marco 1 , launched on 15 December 1964 on a U.S.  Scout rocket  from Wallops Island (VA,USA) with an Italian Launch Team trained by NASA. [ 20 ]  Australia's launch project ( WRESAT ) involved a donated U.S. missile and U. S. support staff as well as a joint launch facility with the  United Kingdom . [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Attacks on satellites   For more details on this topic, see  Anti-satellite weapon .   In recent times satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   Satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth.  Russia , the  United States  and  China  have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites. [ 24 ]  In 2007 the  Chinese  military shot down an aging weather satellite, [ 24 ]  followed by the  US Navy  shooting down a  defunct spy satellite  in February 2008. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Jamming   Due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions they are prone to  jamming  by land-based transmitters. Such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter's range. GPS satellites are potential targets for jamming, [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming.
