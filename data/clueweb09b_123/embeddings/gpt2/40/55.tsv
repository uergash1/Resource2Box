The primary innovation was the development of a network of small overlapping cell sites supported by a call switching infrastructure that tracks users as they moved through a network and pass their call from one site to another without dropping the connection. Bell Labs installed the first commercial cellular network in Chicago in the 1970s. [ 2 ]   Japan's first commercial mobile phone service was launched by  NTT  in 1978. By November 2007, the total number of mobile phone subscriptions in the world had reached 3.3 billion, or half of the human population (although some users have multiple subscriptions, or inactive subscriptions), which also makes the mobile phone the most widely spread technology and the most common electronic device in the world. [ 3 ]   The first mobile phone to enable internet connectivity and wireless email, the  Nokia Communicator , was released in 1996, creating a new category of multi-use devices called smartphones. In 1999 the first mobile internet service was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan under the i-Mode service. By 2007 over 798 million people around the world accessed the internet or equivalent mobile internet services such as WAP and i-Mode at least occasionally using a mobile phone rather than a personal computer.     [ edit ]   Cellular systems     See also:  Cellular frequencies     Mobile phones send and receive  radio  signals with any number of  cell site  base stations fitted with  microwave   antennas . These sites are usually mounted on a tower, pole or building, located throughout populated areas, then connected to a cabled communication network and switching system. The phones have a low-power  transceiver  that transmits voice and data to the nearest cell sites, normally not more than 8 to 13 km (approximately 5 to 8 miles) away.   When the mobile phone or data device is turned on, it registers with the  mobile telephone exchange , or switch, with its unique identifiers, and can then be alerted by the mobile switch when there is an incoming telephone call. The handset constantly listens for the strongest signal being received from the surrounding base stations, and is able to  switch seamlessly  between sites. As the user moves around the network, the "" handoffs "" are performed to allow the device to switch sites without interrupting the call.   Cell sites  have relatively low-power (often only one or two watts) radio transmitters which broadcast their presence and relay communications between the mobile handsets and the switch. The switch in turn connects the call to another subscriber of the same  wireless service provider  or to the  public telephone network , which includes the networks of other wireless carriers. Many of these sites are camouflaged to blend with existing environments, particularly in scenic areas.   The dialogue between the handset and the cell site is a stream of digital data that includes digitised audio (except for the first generation analog networks). The technology that achieves this depends on the system which the  mobile phone operator  has adopted. The technologies are grouped by generation. The first-generation systems started in 1979 with Japan, are all analog and include AMPS and NMT. Second-generation systems, started in 1991 in Finland, are all digital and include GSM, CDMA and TDMA.   The nature of cellular technology renders many phones vulnerable to 'cloning': anytime a cell phone moves out of  coverage  (for example, in a road tunnel), when the signal is re-established, the phone sends out a 're-connect' signal to the nearest cell-tower, identifying itself and signalling that it is again ready to transmit. With the proper equipment, it's possible to intercept the re-connect signal and encode the data it contains into a 'blank' phone -- in all respects, the 'blank' is then an exact duplicate of the real phone and any calls made on the 'clone' will be charged to the original account.   Third-generation (3G) networks, which are still being deployed, began in Japan in 2001. They are all digital, and offer high-speed data access in addition to voice services and include  W-CDMA  (known also as  UMTS ), and CDMA2000 EV-DO. China will launch a third generation technology on the TD-SCDMA standard. Operators use a mix of predesignated  frequency bands  determined by the network requirements and local regulations.   In an effort to limit the potential harm from having a transmitter close to the user's body, the first fixed/mobile cellular phones that had a separate transmitter, vehicle-mounted antenna, and handset (known as  car phones  and  bag phones ) were limited to a maximum 3 watts  Effective Radiated Power . Modern  handheld  cellphones which must have the transmission antenna held inches from the user's skull are limited to a maximum transmission power of 0.6 watts ERP. Regardless of the potential biological effects, the reduced transmission range of modern handheld phones limits their usefulness in rural locations as compared to car/bag phones, and handhelds require that cell towers be spaced much closer together to compensate for their lack of transmission power.   Some handhelds include an optional auxiliary antenna port on the back of the phone, which allows it to be connected to a large external antenna and a 3 watt cellular booster. Alternately in fringe-reception areas, a  cellular repeater  may be used, which uses a long distance high-gain  dish antenna  or  yagi antenna  to communicate with a cell tower far outside of normal range, and a repeater to rebroadcast on a small short-range local antenna that allows any cellphone within a few meters to function properly.     [ edit ]   Tariff models     See also:  GSM services#Voice charges     When cellular telecoms services were launched, phones and calls were very expensive and early mobile operators (carriers) decided to charge for all air time consumed by the mobile phone user. This resulted in the concept of charging callers for outbound calls and also for receiving calls. As mobile phone call charges diminished and phone adoption rates skyrocketed, more modern operators decided not to charge for incoming calls. Thus some markets have ""Receiving Party Pays"" models (also known as ""Mobile Party Pays""), in which both outbound and received calls are charged, and other markets have ""Calling Party Pays"" models, by which only making calls produces costs, and receiving calls is free. An exception to this is  international roaming tariffs , by which receiving calls are normally also charged. [ citation needed ]   The European market adopted a ""Calling Party Pays"" model throughout the GSM environment and soon various other GSM markets also started to emulate this model. As Receiving Party Pays systems have the undesired effect of phone owners keeping their phones turned off to avoid receiving unwanted calls, the total voice usage rates (and profits) in Calling Party Pays countries outperform those in Receiving Party Pays countries. [ citation needed ]  To avoid the problem of users keeping their phone turned off, most Receiving Party Pays countries have either switched to Calling Party Pays, or their carriers offer additional incentives such as a large number of monthly minutes at a sufficiently discounted rate to compensate for the inconvenience.   In most countries today, the person receiving a mobile phone call pays nothing. However, in  Hong Kong , Canada, and the United States, one can be charged per minute, for incoming as well as outgoing calls. In the United States and Canada, a few carriers are beginning to offer unlimited received phone calls. For the Chinese  mainland , it was reported that both of its two operators will adopt the caller-pays approach as early as January 2007. [ 4 ]   The asymmetry of Receiving Party Pays vs Calling Party Pays means a person in a RPP country (such as the US) calling a CPP country (e.g., Europe) pays both the calling charge and the receiving charge and the international toll, while the recipient pays nothing as usual. This is generally reflected in a significantly higher rate to mobile numbers (e.g., 25c/minute vs 3c/minute to a landline). Going the other way there is no difference in rate because the recipient pays the receiving charge. This can make people in CPP countries reluctant to call mobile numbers in RPP countries. There is further asymmetry in that an RPP user can choose a carrier with cheaper incoming minutes, while a CPP user cannot choose a carrier with cheaper RPP-to-CPP rates because these are quoted nationally rather than per carrier. This allows carriers in CPP countries to charge higher rates than would be tolerated in RPP countries.   While some systems of payment are  'pay-as-you-go'  where conversation time is purchased and added to a phone unit via an Internet account or in shops or ATMs, other systems are more traditional ones where bills are paid by regular intervals. Pay as you go (also known as ""pre-pay"") accounts were invented simultaneously in Portugal and Italy and today form more than half of all mobile phone subscriptions. USA, Canada, Costa Rica, Japan and Finland are among the rare countries left where most phones are still contract-based.   One possible alternative is a sim-lock free mobile phone. Sim-lock free mobile phones allow portability between networks so users can use sim cards from various networks and not need to have their phone unlocked.     [ edit ]   Impacts     [ edit ]   Human health and behaviour       Main article:  Mobile phone radiation and health       Since the introduction of mobile phones, concerns (both scientific and public) have been raised about the potential health impacts from regular use. [ 5 ]  But by 2008, American mobile phones transmitted and received more text messages than phone calls. [ 6 ]  Numerous studies have reported no significant relationship between mobile phone use and health, but the effect of mobile phone usage on health continues to be an area of public concern.   For example, at the request of some of their customers,  Verizon  created usage controls that meter service and can switch phones off, so that children could get some sleep. [ 6 ]  There have also been attempts to limit use by persons operating moving trains or automobiles, coaches when writing to potential players on their teams, and movie theater audiences. [ 6 ]  By one measure, nearly 40% of automobile drivers aged 16 to 30 years old text while driving, and by another, 40% of teenagers said they could text blindfolded. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Mobile phone dermatitis   According to  Reuters , The British Association of Dermatologists is warning of a rash occurring on peoples ears or cheeks caused by an allergic reaction from the  nickel  surface commonly found on mobile devices exteriors. There is also a theory it could even occur on the fingers if someone spends a lot of time  text messaging  on metal menu buttons. Earlier this year Lionel Bercovitch of  Brown University  in  Providence ,  Rhode Island , and colleagues tested 22 popular handsets from eight different manufacturers and found nickel on 10 of the devices. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Safety concerns   As of 2007, several airlines are experimenting with base station and antenna systems installed to the aeroplane, allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft's base station. [ 8 ]  Thus, they would not attempt connection to the ground base stations as during take off and landing. [ citation needed ]  Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline  Qantas  is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration in the autumn of 2007. [ citation needed ]   Emirates  has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights. [ citation needed ]  However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use of cell phones and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane.   On March 20, 2008, an Emirates flight was the first time voice calls have been allowed in-flight on commercial airline flights. The breakthrough came after the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the United Arab Emirates-based General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) granted full approval for the AeroMobile system to be used on Emirates. Passengers were able to make and receive voice calls as well as use text messaging. The system automatically came into operation as the Airbus A340-300 reached cruise altitude. Passengers wanting to use the service received a text message welcoming them to the AeroMobile system when they first switched their phones on. The approval by EASA has established that GSM phones are safe to use on airplanes, as the AeroMobile system does not require the modification of aircraft components deemed ""sensitive,"" nor does it require the use of modified phones.   In any case, there are inconsistencies between practices allowed by different airlines and even on the same airline in different countries. For example,  Northwest Airlines  may allow the use of mobile phones immediately after landing on a domestic flight within the US, whereas they may state ""not until the doors are open"" on an international flight arriving in the Netherlands. In April 2007 the US  Federal Communications Commission  officially prohibited passengers' use of cell phones during a flight. [ 9 ]   In a similar vein, signs are put up in many countries, such as Canada, the UK and the U.S., at  petrol stations  prohibiting the use of mobile phones, due to possible safety issues. [ citation needed ]   18 studies have been conducted on the link between cell phones and brain cancer; A review of these studies found that cell phone use of 10 years or more ""give a consistent pattern of an increased risk for acoustic neuroma and glioma"" [ 10 ] . The tumors are found mostly on the side of the head that the mobile phone is in contact with. In July 2008, Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, warned about the radiation from mobile phones. He stated that there was no definitive proof of the link between mobile phones and brain tumors but there was enough studies that mobile phone usage should be reduced as a precaution [ 11 ] . Studies are also being done on children and how mobile phone radiation affects their brains. When children start using mobile phones at a young age, they will have more years to deal with mobile phone radiation than adults will who started using mobile phones at a later age. Also, childrens brains are still developing and radiation can affect the growth of the brain easier than adults. Brains of children under 8 years of age, in fact, absorb three times the amount of radiation that adults brains do. To reduce the amount of radiation being absorbed hands free devices can be used or texting could supplement calls. Calls could also be shortened or limit mobile phone usage in rural areas. Radiation is found to be higher in areas that are located away from mobile phone towers [ 12 ] .     [ edit ]   Etiquette   Most schools in the  United States  and  Europe  and  Canada  have prohibited mobile phones in the classroom, or in school due to the large number of class disruptions that result from their use, and the potential for cheating via text messaging [ citation needed ] . In the UK, possession of a mobile phone in an examination can result in immediate disqualification from that subject or from all that student's subjects. This still applies even if the mobile phone was not turned on at the time. The  JCQ  also requires schools to display notices of the unauthorised use of mobiles, on both the inside and outside of exam rooms.  [ 13 ] . Mobile phones can also be used for bullying and threats to other students, or displaying inappropriate material in school.   A working group made up of Finnish telephone companies, public transport operators and communications authorities has launched a campaign to remind mobile phone users of courtesy, especially when using mass transitwhat to talk about on the phone, and how to. In particular, the campaign wants to impact loud mobile phone usage as well as calls regarding sensitive matters. [ 14 ]   Many US cities with subway transit systems underground are studying or have implemented mobile phone reception in their underground tunnels for their riders. Boston, Massachusetts has investigated such usage in their tunnels, although there is a question of usage etiquette and also how to fairly award contracts to carriers. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   The issue of mobile communication and etiquette has also become an issue of academic interest. The rapid adoption of the device has resulted in the intrusion of telephony into situations where it was previously not used. This has exposed the implicit rules of courtesy and opened them to reevaluation. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   Use by drivers       Main articles:  Mobile phones and driving safety  and  Handsfree       The use of mobile phones by people who are driving has become increasingly common, either as part of their job, as in the case of delivery drivers who are calling a client, or by commuters who are chatting with a friend. While many drivers have embraced the convenience of using their cellphone while driving, some jurisdictions have made the practice against the law, such as  Australia , the Canadian provinces of  Quebec ,  Ontario ,  Nova Scotia , and  Newfoundland and Labrador  as well as the United Kingdom, consisting of a zero-tolerance system operated in Scotland and a warning system operated in England,  Wales , and  Northern Ireland . Officials from these jurisdictions argue that using a mobile phone while driving is an impediment to vehicle operation that can increase the risk of  road traffic accidents .   Studies have found vastly different  relative risks  (RR). Two separate studies using case-crossover analysis each calculated RR at 4, [ 18 ] [ 19 ]  while an epidemiological  cohort study  found RR, when adjusted for crash-risk exposure, of 1.11 for men and 1.21 for women. [ 20 ]   A simulation study from the  University of Utah  Professor David Strayer compared drivers with a  blood alcohol content  of 0.08% to those conversing on a cell phone, and after controlling for driving difficulty and time on task, the study concluded that cell phone drivers exhibited greater impairment than intoxicated drivers.  [ 21 ]  Meta-analysis by The  Canadian Automobile Association [ 22 ]  and The  University of Illinois [ 23 ]  found that response time while using both hands-free and hand-held phones was approximately 0.5  standard deviations  higher than normal driving (i.e., an average driver, while talking on a cell phone, has response times of a driver in roughly the 40th percentile).   Driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than driving while using a hand-held phone, as concluded by case-crossover studies. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]  epidemiological studies, [ 20 ]  simulation studies, [ 21 ]  and meta-analysis [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . Even with this information,  California  recently passed a cell phone law that requires drivers who are 18 years of age or older to use a hands-free device while using the phone in the vehicle. Moreover, this law also restricts drivers under the age of 18 from using a mobile phone. This law went into effect on July 1, 2008 with a $20 fine for the first offense and $50 fines for each subsequent conviction. The consistency of increased crash risk between hands-free and hand-held phone use is at odds with legislation in over 30 countries that prohibit hand-held phone use but allow hands-free. Scientific literature is mixed on the dangers of talking on a phone versus those of talking with a passenger, with the Accident Research Unit at the  University of Nottingham  finding that the number of utterances was usually higher for mobile calls when compared to blindfolded and non-blindfolded passengers, [ 24 ]  but the  University of Illinois  meta-analysis concluding that passenger conversations were just as costly to driving performance as cell phone ones. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Environmental impacts          Cellular antenna disguised to look like a tree       Like all high structures, cellular antenna masts pose a hazard to low flying  aircraft . Towers over a certain height or towers that are close to  airports  or  heliports  are normally required to have  warning lights . There have been reports that warning lights on cellular masts, TV-towers and other high structures can attract and confuse  birds . US authorities estimate that millions of birds are killed near communication towers in the country each year. [ 25 ]   Some cellular antenna towers have been camouflaged to make them less obvious on the horizon, and make them look more like a tree.   An example of the way mobile phones and mobile networks have sometimes been perceived as a threat is the widely reported and later discredited claim that mobile phone masts are associated with the  Colony Collapse Disorder  (CCD) which has reduced bee hive numbers by up to 75% in many areas, especially near cities in the US. The Independent newspaper cited a scientific study claiming it provided evidence for the theory that mobile phone masts  are  a major cause in the collapse of bee populations, with controlled experiments demonstrating a rapid and catastrophic effect on individual hives near masts. [ 26 ]  Mobile phones were in fact not covered in the study, and the original researchers have since emphatically disavowed any connection between their research, mobile phones, and CCD, specifically indicating that the Independent article had misinterpreted their results and created ""a horror story"". [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  While the initial claim of damage to bees was widely reported, the corrections to the story were almost non-existent in the media.     See also:  Electronic waste     There are more than 500 million used mobile phones in the US sitting on shelves or in landfills  [ 30 ] , and it is estimated that over 125 million will be discarded this year alone.  [ 31 ]  The problem is growing at a rate of more than two million phones per week, putting tons of toxic waste into landfills daily. Several companies offer to buy back and recycle mobile phones from users. In the United States many unwanted but working mobile phones are donated to women's shelters to allow emergency communication.     [ edit ]   Usage     [ edit ]   By civilians          This Railfone found on some  Amtrak  trains in North America uses cellular technology.         See also:  List of mobile network operators     An increasing number of countries, particularly in Europe, now have more mobile phones than people. According to the figures from Eurostat, the European Union's in-house statistical office,  Luxembourg  had the highest  mobile phone penetration rate  at 158 mobile subscriptions per 100 people, closely followed by  Lithuania  and Italy. [ 32 ]  In  Hong Kong  the penetration rate reached 139.8% of the population in July 2007. [ 33 ]  Over 50 countries have mobile phone subscription penetration rates higher than that of the population and the Western European average penetration rate was 110% in 2007 (source Informa 2007). Canada currently has the lowest rates of mobile phone penetrations in the industrialised world at 58%.   There are over five hundred million active mobile phone accounts in China, as of 2007, but the total penetration rate there still stands below 50%. [ 34 ]  The total number of mobile phone subscribers in the world was estimated at 2.14 billion in 2005. [ 35 ]  The subscriber count reached 2.7 billion by end of 2006 according to Informa [ citation needed ] , and 3.3 billion by November, 2007 [ 3 ] , thus reaching an equivalent of over half the planet's population. Around 80% of the world's population has access to mobile phone coverage, as of 2006. This figure is expected to increase to 90% by the year 2010. [ 36 ]   In some  developing countries  with little ""landline"" telephone  infrastructure , mobile phone use has quadrupled in the last decade. [ 37 ]  The rise of mobile phone technology in developing countries is often cited as an example of the  leapfrog effect . Many remote regions in the third world went from having no telecommunications infrastructure to having satellite based communications systems. At present, Africa has the largest growth rate of cellular subscribers in the world, [ 38 ]  its markets expanding nearly twice as fast as Asian markets. [ 39 ]  The availability of  prepaid  or  'pay-as-you-go'  services, where the subscriber is not committed to a long term contract, has helped fuel this growth in Africa as well as in other continents.   On a numerical basis, India is the largest growth market, adding about 6 million mobile phones every month. [ 40 ]  With 256.55 million total landline and mobile phones, market penetration in the country is still low at 22.52%. India expects to reach 500 million subscribers by the end of 2010. Simultaneously, landline phone ownership is decreasing gradually and accounts for approximately 40 million connections.   There are three major technical standards for the current generation of mobile phones and networks, and two major standards for the next generation 3G phones and networks. All European and African countries and many Asian countries have adopted a single system,  GSM , which is the only technology available on all continents and in most countries and covers over 74% of all subscribers on mobile networks. In many countries, such as the United States, Australia,  Brazil , Canada,  Costa Rica , India,, South Korea, and  Vietnam , GSM co-exists with other internationally adopted standards such as  CDMA  and TDMA, as well as national standards such as  iDEN  in the USA and PDC in Japan. Over the past five years several dozen mobile operators (carriers) have abandoned networks on TDMA and CDMA technologies, switching over to GSM.   With third generation (3G) networks, which are also known as IMT-2000 networks, about three out of four networks are on the  W-CDMA  (also known as  UMTS ) standard, usually seen as the natural evolution path for GSM and TDMA networks. One in four 3G networks is on the CDMA2000 1x EV-DO technology. Some analysts count a previous stage in CDMA evolution, CDMA2000 1x RTT, as a 3G technology whereas most standardization experts count only CDMA2000 1x EV-DO as a true 3G technology. Because of this difference in interpreting what is 3G, there is a wide variety in subscriber counts. As of June 2007, on the narrow definition there are 200 million subscribers on 3G networks. By using the more broad definition, the total subscriber count of 3G phone users is 475 million.     [ edit ]   Culture and customs          Cellular phones allow people to communicate from almost anywhere at their leisure.       Between the 1980s and the 2000s, the mobile phone has gone from being an expensive item used by the business elite to a pervasive, personal communications tool for the general population. In most countries, mobile phones outnumber land-line phones, with fixed landlines numbering 1.3 billion but mobile subscriptions 3.3 billion at the end of 2007.   In many markets from Japan and South Korea , to Scandinavia, to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, most children age 8-9 have mobile phones and the new accounts are now opened for customers aged 6 and 7. Where mostly parents tend to give hand-me-down used phones to their youngest children, in Japan already new cameraphones are on the market whose target age group is under 10 years of age, introduced by KDDI in February 2007. The USA also lags on this measure, as in the US so far, about half of all children have mobile phones. [ 41 ]  In many  young adults ' households it has supplanted the land-line phone. Mobile phone usage is banned in some countries, such as  North Korea  and restricted in some other countries such as  Burma . [ 42 ]   Given the high levels of societal mobile phone service penetration, it is a key means for people to communicate with each other. The  SMS  feature spawned the "" texting "" sub-culture amongst younger users. In December 1993, the first person-to-person SMS text message was transmitted in Finland. Currently, texting is the most widely used data service; 1.8 billion users generated $80 billion of revenue in 2006 (source ITU). Many phones offer  Instant Messenger  services for simple, easy texting. Mobile phones have Internet service (e.g.  NTT DoCoMo 's  i-mode ), offering text messaging via e-mail in Japan, South Korea, China, and India. Most mobile internet access is much different from computer access, featuring alerts, weather data, e-mail, search engines, instant messages, and game and music downloading; most mobile internet access is hurried and short.   The mobile phone can be a  fashion   totem  custom-decorated to reflect the owner's personality. [ 43 ]  This aspect of the mobile telephony business is, in itself, an industry, e.g.  ringtone  sales amounted to $3.5 billion in 2005. [ 44 ]          The use of a mobile phone is prohibited in some train company carriages       Mobile phone use can be an important matter of social discourtesy: phones ringing during funerals or weddings; in toilets, cinemas and theatres. Some  book shops ,  libraries ,  bathrooms ,  cinemas , doctors' offices and  places of worship  prohibit their use, so that other patrons will not be disturbed by conversations. Some facilities install  signal-jamming equipment  to prevent their use, although in many countries, including the US, such equipment is illegal. Some new  auditoriums  have installed wire mesh in the walls to make a  Faraday cage , which prevents signal penetration without violating signal jamming laws. [ citation needed ]   Trains, particularly those involving long-distance services, often offer a ""quiet carriage"" where phone use is prohibited, much like the designated non-smoking carriage of the past. In the UK however many users tend to ignore this as it is rarely enforced, especially if the other carriages are crowded and they have no choice but to go in the ""quiet carriage"". [ citation needed ]  In Japan, it is generally considered impolite to talk using a phone on any train -- e-mailing is generally the mode of mobile communication. Mobile phone usage on local  public transport  is also increasingly seen as a nuisance; the city of  Graz , for instance, has mandated a total ban of mobile phones on its tram and bus network in 2008 (though texting and emailing is still allowed). [ 45 ] [ 46 ]   Mobile phone use on aircraft  is starting to be allowed with several airlines already offering the ability to use phones during flights. Mobile phone use during flights used to be prohibited and many airlines still claim in their in-plane announcements that this prohibition is due to possible interference with aircraft radio communications. Shut-off mobile phones do not interfere with aircraft avionics; the concern is partially based on the crash of  Crossair Flight 498 . The recommendation why phones should not be used during take-off and landing, even on planes that allow calls or messaging, is so that passengers pay attention to the crew for any possible accident situations, as most aircraft accidents happen on take-off and landing.     [ edit ]   By government agencies     [ edit ]   Law enforcement       Main article:  Lawful interception       Law enforcement have used mobile phone evidence in a number of different ways. Evidence about the physical location of an individual at a given time can be obtained by triangulating the individual's cellphone between several cellphone towers. This triangulation technique can be used to show that an individual's cellphone was at a certain location at a certain time. The concerns over  terrorism  and terrorist use of technology prompted an inquiry by the  British House of Commons   Home Affairs Select Committee  into the use of evidence from mobile phone devices, prompting leading mobile telephone forensic specialists to identify forensic techniques available in this area. [ 47 ]  NIST have published guidelines and procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information present on mobile phones can be found under the NIST Publication SP800-101. [ 48 ]   In the UK in 2000 it was claimed that recordings of mobile phone conversations made on the day of the  Omagh bombing  were crucial to the police investigation. In particular, calls made on two mobile phones which were tracked from south of the Irish border to Omagh and back on the day of the bombing, were considered of vital importance. [ 49 ]   Further example of criminal investigations using mobile phones is the initial location and ultimate identification of the terrorists of the  2004 Madrid train bombings . In the attacks, mobile phones had been used to detonate the bombs. However, one of the bombs failed to detonate, and the  SIM  card in the corresponding mobile phone gave the first serious lead about the terrorists to investigators. By tracking the whereabouts of the SIM card and correlating other mobile phones that had been registered in those areas, police were able to locate the terrorists. [ 50 ]     [ edit ]   Disaster response   The Finnish government decided in 2005 that the fastest way to warn citizens of disasters was the mobile phone network. In Japan, mobile phone companies provide  immediate notification  of  earthquakes  and other  natural disasters  to their customers free of charge  [ 51 ] . In the event of an emergency,  disaster response  crews can locate trapped or injured people using the signals from their mobile phones. An interactive menu accessible through the phone's  Internet browser  notifies the company if the user is safe or in distress. [ citation needed ]  In Finland rescue services suggest hikers carry mobile phones in case of emergency even when deep in the forests beyond  cellular coverage , as the radio signal of a cellphone attempting to connect to a base station can be detected by overflying rescue aircraft with special detection gear. Also, users in the United States can sign up through their provider for free text messages when an  AMBER Alert  goes out for a missing person in their area.   However, most mobile phone networks operate close to capacity during normal times and spikes in call volumes caused by widespread emergencies often overload the system just when it is needed the most. Examples reported in the media where this have occurred include the  September 11, 2001 attacks , the  2003 Northeast blackouts , the  2005 London Tube bombings ,  Hurricane Katrina , the  2006 Hawaii earthquake , and the  2007 Minnesota bridge collapse .   Under FCC regulations, all mobile telephones must be capable of dialing  emergency telephone numbers , regardless of the presence of a SIM card or the payment status of the account.

It was originally known as the  Atari VCS , for  V ideo  C omputer  S ystem , and the name ""Atari 2600"" was first used in  1982 , after the release of the more advanced  Atari 5200 . The 2600 was typically bundled with two  joystick  controllers and a cartridge game.      [ Top ]  History    [ Top ]  Development and market considerations    Atari  had spun off an engineering think-tank in 1975 called Cyan Engineering to research next-generation video game systems, and had been working on a prototype known as ""Stella"" (named after one of the engineer's bicycles) for some time. Unlike prior generations of machines which used custom logic to play a small number of games, Stella was essentially a combination of a complete  CPU , the famous  6502  in a cut-down version, combined with a display and sound chip of their own design known as the  TIA , for  T elevision  I nterface  A daptor . At first the design was not going to be cartridge based, but after seeing a ""fake"" cartridge system on another machine they realized they could place the games on cartridges essentially for the price of the connector and packaging.  In August 1976  Fairchild Semiconductor  released their own cartridge based system basically ""out of the blue"", the  Channel F . Stella was still not ready for production, but it was clear that it needed to be before there were a number of ""me too"" products filling up the market – which had happened after they invented  PONG . Atari simply didn't have the cash flow to complete the system quickly, given that sales of their own PONG systems were cooling.  Nolan Bushnell  eventually turned to  Warner Communications , and sold the company to them in  1976  for $28 million on the promise that Stella would be productized as soon as possible.  Key to the eventual success of the machine was the hiring of  Jay Miner , a chip designer who managed to squeeze an entire breadboard of equipment making up the TIA into a single chip. Once that was completed and debugged the system was ready for shipping.  By the time it was released in  1977 , the development had cost about US$100 million.    [ Top ]  Launch and runaway success    The initial price was $199 with a library of 6 titles. In a play to compete directly with the Channel F, Atari named the machine VCS, as the Channel F was at that point known as the  VES , for  Video Entertainment System . When Fairchild learned of Atari's naming they quicky changed their unit to become the Channel F. However both units were now in the midst of the  video game crash of 1977 ; PONG clones faced with the extinction of their market due to these newer and more powerful machines simply dumped their boxes for ever-lower prices. Soon many of the companies were out of business, and both Fairchild and Atari were selling to a public that were completely burnt out on PONG. In 1977 Atari sold only 250,000 VCS's, 550,000 in 1978 but from a production run of 800,000 which led to massive debt, requiring further support from Warner. This led directly to the disagreements that caused Atari founder  Nolan Bushnell  to leave the company in  1978 .  Once the public realized it was possible to play video games other than PONG, and programmers learned how to push its hardware's capabilities, the 2600 gained popularity. Fairchild had by this point given up, thinking they were a passed fad, thereby handing the entire quickly growing market to Atari. By  1979 , the 2600 was the best selling  Christmas  present (and console), mainly because of its exclusive content, and a million were sold that year.  Atari then licensed the smash  arcade  hit  Space Invaders  by  Taito , which greatly increased the unit's popularity when it was released in May  1980 , doubling sales again to over 2 million units. The 2600 and its cartridges were the main factor behind Atari grossing more than $2 billion in profits in 1980. Sales then doubled again for the next two years, with almost 8 million units selling in 1982.    [ Top ]  Growth pains and decline    During this period Atari continued to grow until it had one of the largest  R&D  divisions in  Silicon Valley . They spent much of their R&D budget on projects that seemed rather out of place at a videogame, or even home computer, company, projects many of which never saw the light of day. Meanwhile several attempts to bring out newer consoles failed for one reason or another, although their  home computer  systems, the  Atari 8-bit family  sold reasonably if not spectacularily. Warner was more than happy anyway, as it seemed to have no end to the sales of the 2600, and Atari was responsible for over half of the company's income.    The programmers of many of Atari's biggest hits grew disgruntled with the company for not crediting game developers. For example, Rick Mauer, the programmer of Atari 2600  Space Invaders , received no credit and made only $11,000 for his efforts, in spite of the cartridge grossing more than $100 million in sales. Some programmers hid their names in obscure places in the game (a practice known as "" Easter eggs "", which continues in software development to this day), but many left the company and formed their own independent software companies. The most prominent and longest-lasting of these third-party developers was  Activision , founded in 1980, whose titles quickly became more popular than those of Atari itself. Atari attempted to block third-party development for the 2600 in court but failed, and soon other publishers, such as Imagic and  Coleco  entered the market.  Atari suffered from image problems when the Mystique company produced a number of pornographic games for the 2600.  The most notorious of these,  Custer's Revenge  caused a large number of protests from women's groups and  Native American  groups.  Atari then sued Mystique in court over the release of the game.  Atari continued to scoop up licenses during the shelf life of the 2600, the most prominent of which included  Pac-Man  and  E.T. (video game) . Public disappointment with these latter two titles is sometimes cited as a big reason for the  video game crash of 1983 . Suddenly Atari's growth meant it was losing massive amounts of money during the crash, at one point about $10,000 a day. Warner quickly grew tired of supporting the now-headless company, and started looking for buyers in  1984 .    [ Top ]  The console that refused to die    Although not formally discontinued, the 2600 was de-emphasized for two years after Warner's 1984 sale of Atari to  Commodore International  founder  Jack Tramiel , who wanted to concentrate on  home computers . A new version of the 2600 was released in  1986  in a smaller, cost-reduced form factor with a modernized  Atari 7800 -like appearance, along with a resurgence in software development both from Atari and from third parties. The Atari 2600 continued to sell in the USA and Europe until  1989 , and continued to sell in  PAL  version in Asian nations until the early 1990s. Over its lifetime, an estimated 25 million units were shipped, and its  video game library  reportedly numbers more than 900 titles.  At the turn of the millennium, 25 years+ after the launch of the Atari 2600, new video games are still made for it by hobbyists, and the console and its old and new games are very popular with collectors because of its significant impact on video game and consumer electronics history and also due to its nostalgic value for many people. In addition, modern Atari 2600 clones remain on the market. One example is the Atari Classics 10-in-1 TV Game, manufactured by Jakks Pacific, which simulates, more or less accurately, the basic electronics of the 2600 console, and includes ROMs from 10 cartridges, into a single Atari-brand-look-a-like joystick with  composite video  outputs for connecting directly to modern televisions or VCRs.    [ Top ] Description    The basic layout of the 2600 is fairly similar to most consoles and home computers of the era. The CPU was the  MOS Technology 6507 , a cut-down version of the 6502, running at 1.19  MHz  in the 2600.  The 6507 included less memory pins — 13 instead of 16 — to fit into a smaller 28-pin package.  Smaller packaging was, and still is, an important factor in overall system cost, and since memory was very expensive at the time, the 6507's small 8  KB  memory space wasn't going to be used up anyway. In fact memory was so expensive they couldn't imagine using up even 4K, and when they got a deal on 24-pin connectors for the cartridge socket, they were only too happy to thereby limit the games to 4K. ¹  The console had 128  bytes  of  RAM  (working storage) that was used by the system to store game state data, i.e. data identifying where the player was in the game, what the score was, etc. RAM was so expensive that there was simply no way to have a ""screen buffer"", a portion of memory that holds the pattern to be drawn to the screen, at least not with the  resolution  they wanted. Instead they decided to have enough memory for only one line of the display at a time, when the TV completed drawing that line, the game was expected to quickly stuff the next line into the TIA while the TV was resetting for the next line.  This is part of the reason that black lines can be seen on the left side of the screen when playing 2600 games.   It was a side-effect of this system, known to 2600 programmers as  racing the beam , that made the 2600 one of the most complex machines in the world to program. Nevertheless it was that same complexity that actually made the system incredibly flexible, and when authors discovered the ""tricks"" the games soon started to gain in power far beyond what the original designers had ever imagined.  The computers in most homes  today  are much more powerful than the 2600.  The CPU of a typical  PC  for home use today is  clocked  at more than 1 GHz, or roughly 1000 times the 1.19 MHz clock rate of the 2600.  Also, the 2600's CPU processed 8 bits of data per ""clock tick"", while modern PC CPUs handle 32 or more bits per (much faster) tick. Most computers today have 256  megabytes  or more of RAM, which is 2,097,152 times the amount of RAM in the 2600. Also, the Atari had no on board  secondary storage , whereas such storage in the form of  hard disk  drives on today's systems will often have a capacity of 100  GB  or so.  (¹ The cartridge connector's 24 pins were allocated to one supply voltage line, two ground lines, 8 data lines, and 13 address lines. However, the uppermost address line was used as a so-called  chip select  for the cartridge's ROM chip, leaving only 12 address lines for the chip's game program.

CB103055         SOLD OUT             Best Electronics has been  selling to Atari 520ST / 1040ST / 1040STE / Mega / MegaSTE / TT and Falcon  Owners and using the Excellent Atari ST HDDRIVER 8 Software Package in house to  prepare All of the Atari ST / Falcon Hard Drives we have sold for near 10 years  now.  It has been our Bench mark ST Hard Drive prep program.  Compared  to the original Atari HD ST Hard Drive program  (has not  been updated or supported for 8 - 10 years now)  and the Old Bench mark  ICD Hard Drive prep Software  (has not been updated or  supported for at least 5 to 7 years) , the HDDRIVER 8 has gone thru  constant upgrades and updates over the last 10 years.  I think when we  first starting to sell the HDDRIVER 7 program years ago, it was on Rev. 7.0  version and currently version is Rev. 8.16.  The German HDDRIVER 8 author  has constantly updated this excellent Hard Drive prep program from the very  first very small Atari Megafile 20 Meg Hard Drives and small SCSI TT Hard drives  to the State of the art Giga Byte very large Hard Drives sold today.    Every time something new came out for the Atari ST computers, including some of  the ST updated Clones and ST /  Falcon Accelerator boards, the HDDRIVER 8  program was upgraded to support these new St products / New Hard Drives.   One of the reasons why we  like the HDDRIVER 8 hard drive program so much, is it is a  very easy to  use ST program and has one of the fastest auto boot up ST hard drive programs we  have seen.  In the 10 years of using the program in house we have only had  one or two Non Atari made hard drive mechs we could not format, I think they had  a defect on the hard drive motherboards.  With its easy to use intuitive  drop down GEM menus, a beginner who had never even formatted an Atari ST Hard  Drive to the Atari ST Hard Drive expert who likes to set his own Hard Drive  internal settings will find the HDDRIVER 8 program Very easy to use.  In  the past years the HDDRIVER program was supplied with a Owners Manual, now has  an on board Read Me file on the 3 1/2 ST Disk and there is    Now     Free   On Line Internet Support and Information in English for Registered HDDRIVER 8  Owners at the HDDRIVER 8 web site in Germany.        CB103057     $49.95      Atari 520ST/520STFM/1040ST/Mega 2 - 4/Stacy/MegaSTE/TT External SCSI Hard Drive!

clueweb09-enwp01-48-15630	"                     Optimus Maximus keyboard          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Oled keyboard )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article's  factual accuracy  may be compromised due to out-of-date information . Please help  improve the article  by updating it. There may be information on the  talk page .       The  Optimus Maximus keyboard , previously just ""Optimus keyboard"", is a  keyboard  developed by the  Art. Lebedev Studio , a Russian design studio headed by  Artemy Lebedev . Each of its keys is a  display  which can dynamically change to adapt to the  keyboard layout  in use or to show the function of the key. Pre-orders began on  20 May   2007  for a limited production run from December 2007 to January 2008, with a second batch expected to arrive in February 2008. It first started shipping the week of February 21, 2008.           Contents       1   Overview     1.1   Optimus mini three   1.2   Optimus Aux   1.3   Production schedule   1.4   Variations       2   Similar keyboards   3   Special features   4   Reviews   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Overview           Photoshop  layout (Mac, prototype rendering)               Quake III Arena  layout. The production model uses the same 48x48 display for all keys including the space bar, unlike this rendering.       The design featured on the studio's website received attention on the web when it was featured on  Slashdot  on  14 July   2005 , and afterwards for a few weeks on other technology websites. The original release date was ""end of 2006"", however production issues caused the  Optimus mini three  to be developed first, with the full keyboard delayed until the end of 2007. The keyboard was number 10 in the  Wired Magazine  2006  Vaporware Awards [ 1 ]  and number 4 on the list in 2007 [ 2 ]  due to its numerous delays and feature reductions.   The Optimus allows for greater  user interaction , by dynamically displaying the current function of the keys. For example, when the user presses the  shift key , the pictures would change to upper-case versions. It would also make switching between different keyboard layouts (such as  English  and  Cyrillic ) rapid, and could make the switch to alternative layouts such as  Dvorak  easier for people who only have a  QWERTY  keyboard with no possibility of rearranging the keys. To demonstrate this concept, there are computer renderings showing example layouts for  Quake III Arena  and  Adobe Photoshop .   A newly-revealed (as of January 3, 2008) patent application filed on March 13, 2007 suggests that  Apple Inc.  may be working on a similar dynamically changeable OLED keyboard. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus mini three   Main article:  Optimus mini three   Art. Lebedev Studio has released a smaller three-key version of their keyboard, named  Optimus mini three . Each of the keys is larger than a standard key. The mini three can be adjusted, through the configuration software, to either a horizontal or vertical orientation.   Initial reviews have been mixed. The keyboard functions as advertised, but it has been criticized for inordinately high CPU usage, slow response time, and buggy configuration software. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus Aux   On  July 21 ,  2008 ,  Engadget  posted about a new version of the keyboard, named Optimus Pultius. It features 15 OLED keys in a three-by-five arrangement and a USB port. It is expected to be released in late 2008 or early 2009. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On  September 19 , 2008, Engadget also reported that the Pultius had been renamed to the Aux [ 8 ]  and included a new rendering of the rear side showing that there would be two USB ports instead of one. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Production schedule   Some reports indicate that the keyboards started shipping on February 21, 2008. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Variations   Variations with fewer OLED keys will also be available, each upgradeable by replacing static keys with OLED keys after purchase. For keyboards with less than a full complement of OLED ""active keys"", additional keys can be purchased and installed. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Similar keyboards   The patent for this ""Display Keyboard"" ( U.S. Patent 5,818,361   ) is held by inventor Elkin Acevedo. [1]  However, the first programmable LCD keyboard  [2]  was developed in the mid-1980s in Germany. This keyboard, sold under the LCBoard name in the U.S. until 1999, contained many of the features of the Optimus keyboard including monochrome graphic icons on each keyboard key, macro programming, context sensitive and application dependent switching between functions.     [ edit ]   Special features   Art. Lebedev Studio is expecting to manufacture the keyboard with these features: [3]     A plastic body (width: 537 mm, depth: 173 mm, height: 38 mm)   Extra-durable  polymer   plastic  keys (20.220.2 mm, visible area 10.110.1 mm)   4848  pixel  screens,  Highcolor  mode (65 536 colors, 10 FPS)   OLED  (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screen for keys   USB 2.0  (or 1.1) connectivity   4-5 year lifetime   A  key-saver  mode   Support for animation on keys at 10  FPS  minimum   Ability to form a mosaic using a combination of key images   Compatibility with  Windows XP ,  Windows Vista  and  Mac OS X  10.5.1 (and higher).   An  SDK  for complete display customization   Swappable keys and support for keys without displays   32  MB   SD card  for storing basic layouts   Non-stop glow time at nominal brightness of 20,000 hours, after which display quality will diminish   An ambient light sensor which can be used to automatically adjust display brightness   A  viewing angle  of 160       [ edit ]   Reviews   Engadget  has published early impressions of the keyboard, approving of the quality of the displays, the build quality of the keyboard, and the customisation software. However, they note that the keys' high resistance means that it is tiring to type on (exhausting the author in ""30 seconds to a minute""), and therefore ""it's better off used as an absurdly configurable Swiss army knife"".

The  Optimus Maximus keyboard , previously just ""Optimus keyboard"", is a  keyboard  developed by the  Art. Lebedev Studio , a Russian design studio headed by  Artemy Lebedev . Each of its keys is a  display  which can dynamically change to adapt to the  keyboard layout  in use or to show the function of the key. Pre-orders began on  20 May   2007  for a limited production run from December 2007 to January 2008, with a second batch expected to arrive in February 2008. It first started shipping the week of February 21, 2008.           Contents       1   Overview     1.1   Optimus mini three   1.2   Optimus Aux   1.3   Production schedule   1.4   Variations       2   Similar keyboards   3   Special features   4   Reviews   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Overview           Photoshop  layout (Mac, prototype rendering)               Quake III Arena  layout. The production model uses the same 48x48 display for all keys including the space bar, unlike this rendering.       The design featured on the studio's website received attention on the web when it was featured on  Slashdot  on  14 July   2005 , and afterwards for a few weeks on other technology websites. The original release date was ""end of 2006"", however production issues caused the  Optimus mini three  to be developed first, with the full keyboard delayed until the end of 2007. The keyboard was number 10 in the  Wired Magazine  2006  Vaporware Awards [ 1 ]  and number 4 on the list in 2007 [ 2 ]  due to its numerous delays and feature reductions.   The Optimus allows for greater  user interaction , by dynamically displaying the current function of the keys. For example, when the user presses the  shift key , the pictures would change to upper-case versions. It would also make switching between different keyboard layouts (such as  English  and  Cyrillic ) rapid, and could make the switch to alternative layouts such as  Dvorak  easier for people who only have a  QWERTY  keyboard with no possibility of rearranging the keys. To demonstrate this concept, there are computer renderings showing example layouts for  Quake III Arena  and  Adobe Photoshop .   A newly-revealed (as of January 3, 2008) patent application filed on March 13, 2007 suggests that  Apple Inc.  may be working on a similar dynamically changeable OLED keyboard. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus mini three   Main article:  Optimus mini three   Art. Lebedev Studio has released a smaller three-key version of their keyboard, named  Optimus mini three . Each of the keys is larger than a standard key. The mini three can be adjusted, through the configuration software, to either a horizontal or vertical orientation.   Initial reviews have been mixed. The keyboard functions as advertised, but it has been criticized for inordinately high CPU usage, slow response time, and buggy configuration software. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus Aux   On  July 21 ,  2008 ,  Engadget  posted about a new version of the keyboard, named Optimus Pultius. It features 15 OLED keys in a three-by-five arrangement and a USB port. It is expected to be released in late 2008 or early 2009. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On  September 19 , 2008, Engadget also reported that the Pultius had been renamed to the Aux [ 8 ]  and included a new rendering of the rear side showing that there would be two USB ports instead of one. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Production schedule   Some reports indicate that the keyboards started shipping on February 21, 2008. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Variations   Variations with fewer OLED keys will also be available, each upgradeable by replacing static keys with OLED keys after purchase. For keyboards with less than a full complement of OLED ""active keys"", additional keys can be purchased and installed. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Similar keyboards   The patent for this ""Display Keyboard"" ( U.S. Patent 5,818,361   ) is held by inventor Elkin Acevedo. [1]  However, the first programmable LCD keyboard  [2]  was developed in the mid-1980s in Germany. This keyboard, sold under the LCBoard name in the U.S. until 1999, contained many of the features of the Optimus keyboard including monochrome graphic icons on each keyboard key, macro programming, context sensitive and application dependent switching between functions.     [ edit ]   Special features   Art. Lebedev Studio is expecting to manufacture the keyboard with these features: [3]     A plastic body (width: 537 mm, depth: 173 mm, height: 38 mm)   Extra-durable  polymer   plastic  keys (20.220.2 mm, visible area 10.110.1 mm)   4848  pixel  screens,  Highcolor  mode (65 536 colors, 10 FPS)   OLED  (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screen for keys   USB 2.0  (or 1.1) connectivity   4-5 year lifetime   A  key-saver  mode   Support for animation on keys at 10  FPS  minimum   Ability to form a mosaic using a combination of key images   Compatibility with  Windows XP ,  Windows Vista  and  Mac OS X  10.5.1 (and higher).   An  SDK  for complete display customization   Swappable keys and support for keys without displays   32  MB   SD card  for storing basic layouts   Non-stop glow time at nominal brightness of 20,000 hours, after which display quality will diminish   An ambient light sensor which can be used to automatically adjust display brightness   A  viewing angle  of 160       [ edit ]   Reviews   Engadget  has published early impressions of the keyboard, approving of the quality of the displays, the build quality of the keyboard, and the customisation software. However, they note that the keys' high resistance means that it is tiring to type on (exhausting the author in ""30 seconds to a minute""), and therefore ""it's better off used as an absurdly configurable Swiss army knife"".

clueweb09-enwp01-59-05801	"                     Keyboard (computing)          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Multimedia keyboard )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (October 2008)       For other uses, see  Keyboard .   In  computing , a  keyboard  is an  input device , partially modeled after the  typewriter keyboard , which uses an arrangement of buttons or  keys , which act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. A keyboard typically has characters  engraved  or  printed  on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written  symbol . However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce  letters ,  numbers  or  signs  ( characters ), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or computer commands.   In normal usage, the keyboard is used to type text and numbers into a  word processor ,  text editor  or other program. In a modern computer, the interpretation of keypresses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all keypresses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either with regular keyboards or by using special  gaming keyboards , which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as  Windows '  Control-Alt-Delete  combination, which brings up a task window or shuts down the machine.

The internationally-common 102/105 key keyboards have a smaller 'left shift' key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Gaming and multimedia   Keyboards with extra keys, such as multimedia keyboards, have special keys for accessing music, web and other oft-used programs, a  mute  button,  volume  buttons or  knob  and standby (sleep) button.  Gaming  keyboards have extra function keys, which can be programmed with keystroke macros. For example, 'ctrl+shift+y' could be a keystroke that is frequently used in a certain computer game. Shortcuts marked on color-coded keys are used for some software applications and for specialized for uses including word processing,  video editing ,  graphic design  and  audio editing .     [ edit ]   Thumb-sized   Smaller keyboards have been introduced for laptops, PDAs, cellphones or users who have a limited workspace. The size of a standard keyboard is dictated by the practical consideration that the keys must be large enough to be easily pressed by fingers. To reduce the size of the keyboard, the numeric keyboard to the right of the alphabetic keyboard can be removed, or the size of the keys can be reduced, which makes it harder to enter text. Another way to reduce the size of the keyboard is to reduce the number of keys and use  chording   keyer , i.e. pressing several keys simultaneously. For example, the  GKOS keyboard  has been designed for small wireless devices. Other two-handed alternatives more akin to a  game controller , such as the  AlphaGrip , are also used as a way to input data and text. Another way to reduce the size of a keyboard is to use smaller buttons and pack them closer together. Such keyboards, often called a "" thumbboard "" (thumbing) are used in some  personal digital assistants  such as the  Palm Treo  and  BlackBerry  and some  Ultra-Mobile PCs  such as the  OQO .     [ edit ]   Numeric   Numeric keyboards contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, and several function keys (e.g. End, Delete, etc.). They are often used to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboard-equipped laptops or with smaller keyboards that do not have a numeric keypad.     [ edit ]   Non-standard or special-use types     [ edit ]   Chorded          A  foldable  keyboard.       A keyset or  chorded keyboard  is a computer input device that allows the user to enter characters or commands formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a ""chord"" on a piano. The large number of combinations available from a small number of keys allows text or commands to be entered with one hand, leaving the other hand free to do something else. A secondary advantage is that it can be built into a device (such as a pocket-sized computer) that is too small to contain a normal sized keyboard. A chorded keyboard designed to be used while held in the hand is called a keyer.     [ edit ]   Virtual   Virtual keyboards, such as the I-Tech Virtual  Laser Keyboard , project an image of a full-size keyboard onto a surface.  Sensors  in the projection unit identify which key is being ""pressed"" and relay the signals to a computer or  personal digital assistant . There is also a virtual keyboard, the On-Screen Keyboard, for use on Windows.     [ edit ]   Touchscreens   Touchscreens, such as with the  iPhone  and the  OLPC  laptop, can be used as a keyboard. (The  OLPC  initiative's second computer will be effectively two tablet touchscreens hinged together like a book. It can be used as a convertible  Tablet PC  where the keyboard is one half-screen (one side of the book) which turns into a touchscreen virtual keyboard.)     [ edit ]   Foldable   Foldable keyboards are made of soft plastic which can be rolled or folded over for travel. When in use, the keyboard can conform to uneven surfaces, and it is more resistant to liquids than a standard keyboard. Some models can be fully immersed in water, making them popular in hospitals and laboratories, as they can be disinfected.     [ edit ]   Layout     [ edit ]   Alphabetic   Main article:  Keyboard layout          The 104-key PC  US   English   QWERTY  keyboard layout evolved from the standard  typewriter  keyboard, with extra keys for computing.              The  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  layout arranges keys so that frequently used keys are easiest to press, which reduces muscle fatigue when typing common English.       There are a number of different arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different  keyboard layouts  arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, either because they are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting,  computer programming , or other purposes. Most of the more common keyboard layouts ( QWERTY -based and similar) were designed in the era of the mechanical typewriters, so their ergonomics had to be slightly compromised in order to tackle some of the mechanical limitations of the typewriter. As the letter-keys were attached to levers that needed to move freely, inventor  Christopher Sholes  developed the QWERTY layout to reduce the likelihood of jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, QWERTY layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as the  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  are not in widespread use.   The QWERTZ layout is fairly widely used in Germany and much of Central Europe. The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped, and most special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters. Another situation takes place with national layouts. Keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release the space for  ; similarly, those for French and other European languages may have a special key for the character   . The AZERTY layout is used in France, Belgium and some neighbouring countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout in that the A and Q are swapped, the Z and W are swapped, and the M is moved from the right of N to the right of L (where colon/semicolon is on a US keyboard). The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters.   Keyboards designed for non-English speaking markets may have special keys to switch between non-English typing and the Roman alphabet and vice-versa. In Japan, keyboards often can be switched between Japanese and the Roman alphabet, and the character  (the Yen currency) is used instead of ""\"". In Israel, keyboards can often be switched between Hebrew and English. In bilingual regions of Canada and in the French-speaking province of Quebec, keyboards can often be switched between an English and a French-language keyboard; while both keyboards share the same QWERTY alphabetic layout, the French-language keyboard enables the user to type accented vowels such as """" or """" with a single keystroke. Using keyboards for other languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the keys, because the standard keyboard layouts do not share even similar characters of different languages (see the example in the figure above).     [ edit ]   Key types     [ edit ]   Alphanumeric          A  Hebrew keyboard  lets the user type in both  Hebrew  and the  Latin alphabet .       Alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys are used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed at the same time as some modifier keys.   The  Space bar  is a horizontal bar in the lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses in addition to its normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.     [ edit ]   Modifiers          A  Space-cadet keyboard  has many modifier keys.       Modifier keys  are special keys that modify the normal action of another key, when the two are pressed in combination. For example, <Alt> + <F4> in Microsoft Windows will close the program in an active window. In contrast, pressing just <F4> will probably do nothing, unless assigned a specific function in a particular program. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing. The most widely-used modifier keys include the  Control key ,  Shift key  and the  Alt key . The  AltGr key  is used to access additional symbols for keys, that have three symbols printed on them. On the Macintosh and Apple keyboards, the modifier keys are the  Option key  and  Command key , respectively. On MIT computer keyboards, the  Meta key  is used as a modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a  Windows key . Compact  keyboard layouts  often use a  Fn key . "" Dead keys "" allow placement of a  diacritic  mark, such as an accent, on the following letter (e.g., the  Compose key ).   The  Enter/Return key  typically causes a command line, window form or dialog box to operate its default function, which is typically to finish an ""entry"" and begin the desired process. In word processing applications, pressing the enter key ends a paragraph and starts a new one.     [ edit ]   Navigation and typing mode   Navigation keys include a variety of keys which move the cursor to different positions on the screen.  Arrow keys  are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the ' Page Up and Page Down keys ', scroll the page up and down. The  Home  key is used to return the cursor to the beginning of the line where the cursor is located; the  End key  puts the cursor at the end of the line. The  Tab key  advances the cursor to the next tab stop.   The  Insert key  is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The  Delete key  discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position ""back"" towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The  Backspace  key deletes the preceding character.   Lock keys  lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numpad. The lock keys include  Scroll lock ,  Num lock  (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and  Caps lock .     [ edit ]   System commands   The  SysRq  /  Print screen  commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a ""panic"" button to recover from crashes. The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but nowadays it usually puts a screenshot in the  clipboard . The  Break key/Pause key  no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teletype users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection. In programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties.   The  Escape key  (often abbreviated Esc) is used to initiate an escape sequence. As most computer users no longer are concerned with the details of controlling their computer's peripherals, the task for which the escape sequences were originally designed, the escape key was appropriated by application programmers, most often to mean Stop. This use continues today in Microsoft Windows's use of escape as a shortcut in dialog boxes for No, Quit, Exit, Cancel, or Abort. A common application today of the Esc key is as a shortcut key for the Stop button in many web browsers. On machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the ""start"" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows XP and Windows Vista.   The  Menu key  or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards. It is used launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 keyboard shortcut).     [ edit ]   Miscellaneous   Many, but not all, computer keyboards have a  numeric keypad  to the right of the alphabetic keyboard. On  Japanese/Korean keyboards , there may be  Language input keys . Some keyboards have  power management keys  (e.g.,  Power key ,  Sleep key  and  Wake key ); internet keys to access a web browser or  E-mail ; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls.     [ edit ]   Technology     [ edit ]   Key switches          Keyboards on laptops such as this  Sony   VAIO  usually have a shorter travel distance for the keystroke and a reduced set of keys.       "" Dome-switch "" keyboards (sometimes incorrectly referred to as a  membrane keyboards ) are the most common type in use in the 2000s. When a key is pressed, it pushes down on a rubber dome sitting beneath the key. A  conductive  contact on the underside of the dome touches (and hence connects) a pair of conductive lines on the circuit below. This bridges the gap between them and allows  electric current  to flow (the open  circuit  is closed). A scanning signal is emitted by the chip along the pairs of lines in the  matrix circuit  which connects to all the keys. When the signal in one pair becomes different, the chip generates a ""make code"" corresponding to the key connected to that pair of lines.   Keycaps  are also required for most types of keyboards; while modern keycaps are typically surface-marked, they can also be  2-shot molded,  or engraved, or they can be made of transparent material with printed paper inserts   Keys on older IBM keyboards were made with a  ""buckling spring""  mechanism, in which a coil spring under the key buckles under pressure from the user's finger, pressing a rubber dome, whose inside is coated with conductive graphite, which connects two leads below, completing a circuit. This produces a clicking sound, and gives physical feedback for the typist indicating that the key has been depressed. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] When a key is pressed and the circuit is completed, the code generated is sent to the computer either via a keyboard cable (using on-off electrical pulses to represent  bits ) or over a  wireless  connection.   A chip inside the computer receives the signal bits and decodes them into the appropriate keypress. The computer then decides what to do on the basis of the key pressed (e.g. display a character on the screen, or perform some action). When the key is released, a break code (different from the make code) is sent to indicate the key is no longer pressed. If the break code is missed (e.g. due to a keyboard switch) it is possible for the keyboard controller to believe the key is pressed down when it is not, which is why pressing then releasing the key again will release the key (since another break code is sent). Other types of keyboards function in a similar manner, the main differences being how the individual key-switches work. For more on this subject refer to the article on  keyboard technology .   Certain key presses are special, namely  Ctrl-Alt-Delete  and  SysRq , but what makes them special is a function of software. In the PC architecture, the keyboard controller (the component in the computer that receives the make and break codes) sends the computer's CPU a hardware  interrupt  whenever a key is pressed or released. The CPU's interrupt routine which handles these interrupts usually just places the key's code in a queue, to be handled later by other code when it gets around to it, then returns to whatever the computer was doing before. The special keys cause the interrupt routine to take a different ""emergency"" exit instead. This more trusted route is much harder to intercept.   The layout of a keyboard can be changed by remapping the keys. When you remap a key, you tell the computer a new meaning for the pressing of that key. Keyboard remapping is supported at a driver-level configurable within the operating system, or as add-ons to the existing programs. For Windows, Microsoft provides a downloadable tool called  Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator , and there are several other software programs, including  SharpKeys  and  KeyTweak .     [ edit ]   Control processor   The modern PC keyboard has more than just switches. It also includes a control processor and indicator lights to provide feedback to the user about what state the keyboard is in. Depending on the sophistication of the controller's programming, the keyboard may also offer other special features. The processor is usually a single chip  8048   microcontroller  variant. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs and it processes the incoming keystrokes and sends the results down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to a receiver in the main computer box. It also controls the illumination of the "" caps lock "", "" num lock "" and "" scroll lock "" lights.   A common test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the ""caps lock"" key. The keyboard sends the key code to the  keyboard driver  running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the  shift ,  alt  and  control  state of the keyboard.   When pressing a keyboard key, the key ""bounces"" like a ball against its contacts several times before it settles into firm contact. When released, it bounces some more until it reverts to the uncontacted state. If the computer were watching for each pulse, it would see many keystrokes for what the user thought was just one. To resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard (or computer) "" debounces "" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one ""confirmed"" keystroke that (usually) corresponds to what is typically a solid contact.   Some low-quality keyboards suffer problems with  rollover  (that is, when multiple keys are pressed in quick succession); some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. This is undesirable for  games  (designed for multiple keypresses, e.g. casting a spell while holding down keys to run) and undesirable for extremely fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys). A common side effect of this shortcoming is called ""phantom key blocking"": on some keyboards, pressing three keys simultaneously sometimes resulted in a 4th keypress being registered. Modern keyboards prevent this from happening by blocking the 3rd key in certain key combinations, but while this prevents phantom input, it also means that when two keys are depressed simultaneously, many of the other keys on the keyboard will not respond until one of the two depressed keys is lifted. With better keyboards designs, this seldom happens in office programs, but it remains a problem in games even on expensive keyboards, due to wildly different and/or configurable key/command layouts in different games.     [ edit ]   Connection types   There are several ways of connecting a keyboard using cables, including the standard AT connector commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the  PS/2  and the  USB  connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary  Apple Desktop Bus  for its keyboard connector.   Wireless  keyboards have become popular for their increased user freedom. A wireless keyboard often includes a required combination transmitter and receiver unit that attaches to the computer's keyboard port (see  Connection types  above). The wireless aspect is achieved either by  radio frequency  (RF) or by  infrared  (IR) signals sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer. A wireless keyboard may use an industry standard RF, called  Bluetooth . With Bluetooth, the transceiver may be built into the computer. However, a wireless keyboard needs batteries to work and may pose a security problem due to the risk of data "" eavesdropping "" by hackers. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Alternative text-entering methods          An on-screen keyboard controlled with the mouse can be used by users with limited mobility.       Optical character recognition  (OCR) is preferable to rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a  Linotype -composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of  character  codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example,  Google Book Search ) and promises more for the future.   Speech recognition  converts speech into machine-readable text (that is, a string of character codes). The technology has already reached an impressive state and is already implemented in  various software products . For certain uses (e.g., transcription of medical or legal dictation; journalism; writing essays or novels) it is starting to replace the keyboard; however, it does not threaten to replace keyboards entirely anytime soon. It can, however, interpret commands (for example, ""close window"" or ""undo that"") in addition to text. Therefore, it has theoretical potential to replace keyboards entirely (whereas OCR replaces them only for a certain kind of task).   Pointing devices  can be used to enter text or characters in contexts where using a physical keyboard would be inappropriate or impossible. These accessories typically present characters on a display, in a layout that provides fast access to the more frequently used characters or character combinations. Popular examples of this kind of input are  Graffiti ,  Dasher  and on-screen  virtual keyboards . FITALY ( http://www.FITALY.com ) is a stylus/one-finger keyboard that can yield 50+ WPM. The key is to stare at the keyboard, not the screen (as in traditional touch typing). No memorization of layout is required. It is engineered for rapid text input (e.g., some 85% of English words are visible at the center of the keyboard). It is available for many mobile and laptop devices.     [ edit ]   Other issues     [ edit ]   Keystroke hacking   Keystroke logging  (often called keylogging) is a method of capturing and recording user keystrokes. While it is used legitimately to measure employee productivity on certain clerical tasks, or by law enforcement agencies to find out about illegal activities, it is also used by hackers for law-breaking. Hackers use keyloggers as a means to obtain passwords or encryption keys and thus bypassing other security measures.   Keystroke logging can be achieved by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computers operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.   Anti-spyware  applications are able to detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by  anti-spyware  programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a  firewall  does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured.  Network monitors  (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from ""phoning home"" with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window.  [ 5 ]   Electromagnetic waves released every time key is pressed on the keyboard can be detected by a nearby antenna and interpreted by computer software to work out exactly what was typed.  [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Physical injury          Proper ergonomic design of computer keyboard desks is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries, which can develop over time and can lead to long-term disability. [ 7 ]       The use of any keyboard may cause serious injury (that is,  carpal tunnel syndrome  or other  repetitive strain injury ) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks to get up and walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.   Some  Adaptive technology  ranging from special keyboards, mouse replacements and pen tablet interfaces to  speech recognition  software can reduce the risk of injury. Pause software reminds the user to pause frequently. Switching to a much more ergonomic keyboard layout such as  Dvorak [ citation needed ]  or  Colemak  may reduce the risk of injury. Switching to a much more ergonomic mouse, such as a vertical mouse or joystick mouse may provide relief. Switching from using a mouse to using a stylus pen with graphic tablet or a  trackpad  such as a  Smart Cat  trackpad can lessen the repetitive strain on the arms and hands.

clueweb09-enwp01-59-18760	"                     Optimus Maximus keyboard          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Optimus Keyboard )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    The  factual accuracy  of this article or section may be compromised due to out-of-date information.   You can  improve the article  by updating it. There may be information on the  talk page .       The  Optimus Maximus keyboard , previously just ""Optimus keyboard"", is a  keyboard  developed by the  Art. Lebedev Studio , a Russian design studio headed by  Artemy Lebedev . Each of its keys is a  display  which can dynamically change to adapt to the  keyboard layout  in use or to show the function of the key. Pre-orders began on  20 May   2007  for a limited production run from December 2007 to January 2008, with a second batch expected to arrive in February 2008. It first started shipping the week of February 21, 2008.           Contents       1   Overview     1.1   Optimus mini three   1.2   Optimus Aux   1.3   Production schedule   1.4   Variations       2   Similar keyboards   3   Special features   4   Reviews   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Overview           Photoshop  layout (Mac, prototype rendering)               Quake III Arena  layout. The production model uses the same 48x48 display for all keys including the space bar, unlike this rendering.       The design featured on the studio's website received attention on the web when it was featured on  Slashdot  on  14 July   2005 , and afterwards for a few weeks on other technology websites. The original release date was ""end of 2006"", however production issues caused the  Optimus mini three  to be developed first, with the full keyboard delayed until the end of 2007. The keyboard was number 10 in the  Wired Magazine  2006  Vaporware Awards [ 1 ]  and number 4 on the list in 2007 [ 2 ]  due to its numerous delays and feature reductions.   The Optimus allows for greater  user interaction , by dynamically displaying the current function of the keys. For example, when the user presses the  shift key , the pictures would change to upper-case versions. It would also make switching between different keyboard layouts (such as  English  and  Cyrillic ) rapid, and could make the switch to alternative layouts such as  Dvorak  easier for people who only have a  QWERTY  keyboard with no possibility of rearranging the keys. To demonstrate this concept, there are computer renderings showing example layouts for  Quake III Arena  and  Adobe Photoshop .   A newly-revealed (as of January 3, 2008) patent application filed on March 13, 2007 suggests that  Apple Inc.  may be working on a similar dynamically changeable OLED keyboard. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus mini three       Main article:  Optimus mini three       Art. Lebedev Studio has released a smaller three-key version of their keyboard, named  Optimus mini three . Each of the keys is larger than a standard key. The mini three can be adjusted, through the configuration software, to either a horizontal or vertical orientation.   Initial reviews have been mixed. The keyboard functions as advertised, but it has been criticized for inordinately high CPU usage, slow response time, and buggy configuration software. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus Aux   On  July 21 ,  2008 ,  Engadget  posted about a new version of the keyboard, named Optimus Pultius. It features 15 OLED keys in a three-by-five arrangement and a USB port. It is expected to be released in late 2008 or early 2009. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On  September 19 , 2008, Engadget also reported that the Pultius had been renamed to the Aux [ 8 ]  and included a new rendering of the rear side showing that there would be two USB ports instead of one. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Production schedule   Some reports indicate that the keyboards started shipping on February 21, 2008. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Variations   Variations with fewer OLED keys will also be available, each upgradeable by replacing static keys with OLED keys after purchase. For keyboards with less than a full complement of OLED ""active keys"", additional keys can be purchased and installed. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Similar keyboards   The patent for this ""Display Keyboard"" ( U.S. Patent 5,818,361   ) is held by inventor Elkin Acevedo. [1]  However, the first programmable LCD keyboard  [2]  was developed in the mid-1980s in Germany. This keyboard, sold under the LCBoard name in the U.S. until 1999, contained many of the features of the Optimus keyboard including monochrome graphic icons on each keyboard key, macro programming, context sensitive and application dependent switching between functions.     [ edit ]   Special features   Art. Lebedev Studio is expecting to manufacture the keyboard with these features: [3]     A plastic body (width: 537 mm, depth: 173 mm, height: 38 mm)   Extra-durable  polymer   plastic  keys (20.220.2 mm, visible area 10.110.1 mm)   4848  pixel  screens,  Highcolor  mode (65 536 colors, 10 FPS)   OLED  (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screen for keys   USB 2.0  (or 1.1) connectivity   4-5 year lifetime   A  key-saver  mode   Support for animation on keys at 10  FPS  minimum   Ability to form a mosaic using a combination of key images   Compatibility with  Windows XP ,  Windows Vista  and  Mac OS X  10.5.1 (and higher).   An  SDK  for complete display customization   Swappable keys and support for keys without displays   32  MB   SD card  for storing basic layouts   Non-stop glow time at nominal brightness of 20,000 hours, after which display quality will diminish   An ambient light sensor which can be used to automatically adjust display brightness   A  viewing angle  of 160       [ edit ]   Reviews   Engadget  has published early impressions of the keyboard, approving of the quality of the displays, the build quality of the keyboard, and the customisation software. However, they note that the keys' high resistance means that it is tiring to type on (exhausting the author in ""30 seconds to a minute""), and therefore ""it's better off used as an absurdly configurable Swiss army knife"".

The design featured on the studio's website received attention on the web when it was featured on  Slashdot  on  14 July   2005 , and afterwards for a few weeks on other technology websites. The original release date was ""end of 2006"", however production issues caused the  Optimus mini three  to be developed first, with the full keyboard delayed until the end of 2007. The keyboard was number 10 in the  Wired Magazine  2006  Vaporware Awards [ 1 ]  and number 4 on the list in 2007 [ 2 ]  due to its numerous delays and feature reductions.   The Optimus allows for greater  user interaction , by dynamically displaying the current function of the keys. For example, when the user presses the  shift key , the pictures would change to upper-case versions. It would also make switching between different keyboard layouts (such as  English  and  Cyrillic ) rapid, and could make the switch to alternative layouts such as  Dvorak  easier for people who only have a  QWERTY  keyboard with no possibility of rearranging the keys. To demonstrate this concept, there are computer renderings showing example layouts for  Quake III Arena  and  Adobe Photoshop .   A newly-revealed (as of January 3, 2008) patent application filed on March 13, 2007 suggests that  Apple Inc.  may be working on a similar dynamically changeable OLED keyboard. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus mini three       Main article:  Optimus mini three       Art. Lebedev Studio has released a smaller three-key version of their keyboard, named  Optimus mini three . Each of the keys is larger than a standard key. The mini three can be adjusted, through the configuration software, to either a horizontal or vertical orientation.   Initial reviews have been mixed. The keyboard functions as advertised, but it has been criticized for inordinately high CPU usage, slow response time, and buggy configuration software. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus Aux   On  July 21 ,  2008 ,  Engadget  posted about a new version of the keyboard, named Optimus Pultius. It features 15 OLED keys in a three-by-five arrangement and a USB port. It is expected to be released in late 2008 or early 2009. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On  September 19 , 2008, Engadget also reported that the Pultius had been renamed to the Aux [ 8 ]  and included a new rendering of the rear side showing that there would be two USB ports instead of one. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Production schedule   There are reports as of the 21st of February 2008, that the keyboards have started to ship. [1]     [ edit ]   Variations   Variations with fewer OLED keys will also be available, each upgradeable by replacing static keys with OLED keys after purchase. For keyboards with less than a full complement of OLED ""active keys"", additional keys can be purchased and installed. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Similar keyboards   The patent for this ""Display Keyboard"" ( U.S. Patent 5,818,361   ) is held by inventor Elkin Acevedo. [2]  However, the first programmable LCD keyboard  [3]  was developed in the mid-1980s in Germany. This keyboard, sold under the LCBoard name in the U.S. until 1999, contained many of the features of the Optimus keyboard including monochrome graphic icons on each keyboard key, macro programming, context sensitive and application dependent switching between functions.     [ edit ]   Special Features   Art. Lebedev Studio is expecting to manufacture the keyboard with these features: [4]     A plastic body (width: 537 mm, depth: 173 mm, height: 38 mm)   Extra-durable  polymer   plastic  keys (20.220.2 mm, visible area 10.110.1 mm)   4848  pixel  screens,  Highcolor  mode (65 536 colors, 10 FPS)   OLED  (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screen for keys   USB 2.0  (or 1.1) connectivity   4-5 year lifetime   A  key-saver  mode   Support for animation on keys at 10  FPS  per second minimum   Ability to form a mosaic using a combination of key images   Compatibility with  Windows XP ,  Windows Vista  and  Mac OS X  10.5.1 (and higher).   An  SDK  for complete display customization   Swappable keys and support for keys without displays   32  MB   SD card  for storing basic layouts   Non-stop glow time at nominal brightness of 20,000 hours, after which display quality will diminish   An ambient light sensor which can be used to automatically adjust display brightness   A  viewing angle  of 160       [ edit ]   Reviews   Engadget  has published early impressions of the keyboard, approving of the quality of the displays, the build quality of the keyboard, and the customisation software. However, they note that the keys' high resistance means that it is tiring to type on (exhausting the author in ""30 seconds to a minute""), and therefore ""it's better off used as an absurdly configurable Swiss army knife"".

Experiments in constructing electronic instruments began as early as the 1890s, when Thaddeus Cahill constructed the Telharmonium; it was first exhibited in 1906, and attempts to manufacture it continued sporadically until the venture failed shortly before World War I. During the 1920s and 1930s many electronic instruments were invented, among them the Theremin (1924) and the Ondes martenot (1928); although they were used by some composers of the time (among them Honegger, Milhaud and Messiaen), only the Ondes martenot remains in use. Experimental projects involving the manipulation of gramophone records to produce pieces of music began around the same time; a later, sophisticated example of this technique is Cage's  Imaginary Landscape no.1  (1939), but the concept was not widely used. In the early days the technology of electronic music was evolving far more quickly than its aesthetics; many composers were reluctant to work in a field without traditions. It was not until after World War II that musicians began to formulate codes of practice: the electronic music tradition began at this time.   The first radical experiments were made by Pierre Schaeffer at the RTF studios in Paris in 1948. He worked with recordings of pre-existing sound which he manipulated and modified in playback, constructing pieces out of chains of noises. The use of natural, or concrete, sound sources caused this style to be named  musique concrte . Schaeffer's first compositions, the  Etudes , were realized in 1948; with others, including Pierre Henri, he developed a detailed syntax for the genre in the 1950s. At the same time, at the WDR studio in Cologne, Werner Meyer Eppler and Herbert Eimert were developing  Elektronische Musik , using test equipment - oscillators as sound sources, modified by filters and modulators - rather than pre-recorded sound. Early compositions by Eimert, Goeyvaerts and others, were followed by Stockhausen's  Studie I  (1953) and  Studie II  (1954), the most sophisticated pieces of electronic music to that date. The aesthetics and techniques of such works were discussed in such journals as  Die Reihe , and controversies arose between the supporters of the Paris and Cologne schools. These were effectively reconciled when Stockhausen's  Gesang der Jnglinge  (1956) used both techniques, establishing them as twin facets of one genre.   During the 1950s and 1960s electronic music studios were founded in major cities in Europe, the USA and Japan, and such composers as Berio, Babbitt, Luening and Varse used electronic techniques in their work. Although composers continued to create works in the studio for dissemination on tape they also began to explore the use of electronics in performance. Works like Cage's  Atlas eclipticalis  (1961-2) and Stockhausen's  Mixtur  (1964),  Kurzwellen  (1968) and  Mantra  (1970), require conventional instruments and various electronic techniques. During the 1960s groups devoted to the concert presentation of live electronic music were established; these included Musica Elettronica Viva and the Sonic Arts Union.   In the 1960s, when the voltage-controlled  Synthesizer  became widely available (in systems manufactured first in the USA by Moog, Buchla and others), composers were able to work with portable machines for the first time. Around the same time programs for  Computers  were developed that facilitated the digital synthesis and manipulation of sound and the storage of information about sounds and structures. University departments at Princeton and Stanford, and such institutions as IRCAM in Paris established studios where computer synthesis could be explored. IRCAM's director, Pierre Boulez, produced one of the most effective works using electronic means,  Rpons  (1980), in which the sounds of an orchestra are modified by computer analysis and synthesis. In the 1980s many works were produced suggesting that the medium, though still in places uncharted, continues to provide a stimulus to composers. By the mid-1980s digital synthesizers, smaller and more powerful than their analogue ancestors and offering the facility of linkage to home computer systems, have brought facilities previously only available in the most advanced studios into the composer's workroom.                                Britannica Concise Encyclopedia:     electronic music         Home  >  Library  >  Miscellaneous  >  Britannica Concise Encyclopedia            Any music involving electronic processing (e.g., recording and editing on tape) and whose reproduction involves the use of loudspeakers. In the late 1940s, magnetic tape began to be used, especially in France, to modify natural sounds (playing them backward, at different speeds, etc.), creating the genre known as  musique concrte . By the early 1950s, composers in Germany and the U.S. were employing assembled conglomerations of  oscillator s, filters, and other equipment to produce entirely new sounds. The development of voltage-controlled oscillators and filters led, in the 1950s, to the first  synthesizer s, which effectively standardized the assemblages and made them more flexible. No longer relying on tape editing, electronic music could now be created in real time. Since their advent in the late 1970s, personal computers have been used to control the synthesizers. Digital sampling — composing with music and sounds electronically extracted from other recordings — has largely replaced the use of oscillators as a sound source.

Initially, a distinction must be made between the technological development of electronic instruments and the music conceived to utilize the inherent advantages of these instruments. Experiments in electronic tone production began soon after the invention of the vacuum tube (see  electron tube ). The first important instrument, the theremin, invented by the Russian Leon Theremin in 1920, used interference beats of two oscillators to produce sine-wave tones. The Ondes Martinot, invented in 1928, and the Trautonium, invented in 1930, were of similar design. The earliest pieces of electronic music used recorded sounds that were then electronically altered to create sonic collages. This style, called  musique concrete,  was developed in Paris in 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer. The invention of the tape recorder in the late 1940s gave composers new means for modifying recorded sounds, including splicing (cutting the tape to create new juxtapositions of sound), speed variation (which changes the pitch of the recorded sound), and mixing (which allowed two or more different recordings to be played back at the same time). In popular music, Les  Paul  was one of the pioneers of electronic music, inventing the first solid-body electric guitar in 1946 and recording music in the 1950s in an eight-track recording studio of his own design. Controlling aspects of the musical sound by means of voltage regulation eventually led to the invention of synthesizers, devices that could produce and modify sound for musical applications. Among the earliest of these was the RCA synthesizer developed in the late 1950s and used extensively by composer Milton  Babbitt  in many of his electronic works. In the 1950s various studios that specialized in the production of electro-acoustic music were developed, including the West German Radio Studio in Cologne, associated with composer Karlheinz  Stockhausen , the Italian Radio Studio in Milan, associated with Luciano  Berio  and Bruno  Maderna , and the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, associated with Otto Luening, Vladimir  Ussachevsky , Mario Davidovsky, and Babbitt. During the 1960s synthesizers were made widely available by companies such as Moog and Buchla and found widespread usage in rock music. Popular groups such as the  Beatles  and the Beach Boys began experiments in multitrack recording, years after the innovations of Paul, that enabled several different recordings to be synchronized on the same tape. Eventually synthesizers switched from voltage control to digital control. In 1983 the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) standard was agreed on by synthesizer manufacturers (see  computer music ). This digital code enables different electronic devices to communicate a variety of information to each other and allows computer control of synthesizer output. MIDI can also be used to control a wide range of equipment in addition to synthesizers; these include mixers, lights, and signal processors (devices that modify sounds by adding reverberation, by modifying pitch, and by other means). Today MIDI is widely used in both academic and popular musical production. In MIDI production, computers are often used as sequencers (devices that control the output of musical instruments and signal processors). Throughout the last three decades of the 20th cent. electronic music increasingly became a part of pop music compositions, eventually allowing a solo artist to compose, produce, and perform music that employs a full complement of instrumental sounds. In the 1980s MIDI was also used in the creation of the radio baton, a new instrument that allows players to control the nuances of the music played. Bibliography See P.

Electronic music  is music that employs  electronic musical instruments  and  electronic   music technology  in its production.  [ 1 ]  In general a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. [ 2 ]  Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the  telharmonium ,  Hammond organ , and the  electric guitar . Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the  Theremin ,  sound synthesizer , and  computer . [ 3 ]   Electronic music was once associated almost exclusively with Western  art music  but from the late 1960s on the availability of affordable music technology meant that music produced using electronic means became increasingly common in the popular domain. [ 4 ]  Today electronic music includes many varieties and ranges from experimental art music to popular forms such as  electronic dance music .

The ability to record sounds is often connected to the production of electronic music, but not absolutely necessary for it. The earliest known sound recording device was the phonautograph, patented in 1857 by  douard-Lon Scott de Martinville . It could record sounds visually, but was not meant to play them back. [ 5 ]   In 1878,  Thomas A. Edison  patented the phonograph, which used cylinders similar to  Scott 's device. Although cylinders continued in use for some time,  Emile Berliner  developed the disc phonograph in 1887. [ 6 ]   A significant invention, which was later to have a profound effect on electronic music, was  Lee DeForest 's triode  audion . This was the first thermionic valve, or  vacuum tube , invented in 1906, which led to the generation and amplification of electrical signals, radio broadcasting, and electronic computation, amongst other things.   Before electronic music, there was a growing desire for  composers  to use emerging technologies for musical purposes. Several instruments were created that employed electromechanical designs and they paved the way for the later emergence of electronic instruments. An electromechanical instrument called the  Telharmonium  (sometimes Teleharmonium or Dynamophone) was developed by  Thaddeus Cahill  in the years 1898-1912. However, simple inconvenience hindered the adoption of the Telharmonium, due to its immense size. The first electronic instrument is often viewed to be the  Theremin , invented by Professor  Leon Theremin  circa 19191920. [ 7 ]  Another early electronic instrument was the  Ondes Martenot , which was most famously used in the  Turangalla-Symphonie  by  Olivier Messiaen  as well as other works by him. It was also used by other, primarily French, composers such as  Andre Jolivet . [ citation needed ]       ""New Aesthetic of Music""       Main article:  Ferruccio Busoni       Just a year later, another significant contribution was made to the advent of experimental music. This was the 1907 publication of  Ferruccio Busoni 's  Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music , which discussed the use of electrical and other new sound sources in future music. He wrote of the future of microtonal scales in music, made possible by Cahill's Dynamophone:     Only a long and careful series of experiments, and a continued training of the ear, can render this unfamiliar material approachable and plastic for the coming generation, and for Art. [ 8 ]     Also in the  Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music , Busoni states:     Music as an art, our so-called occidental music, is hardly four hundred years old; its state is one of development, perhaps the very first stage of a development beyond present conception, and wewe talk of ""classics"" and ""hallowed traditions""! And we have talked of them for a long time! We have formulated rules, stated principles, laid down laws;we apply laws made for maturity to a child that knows nothing of responsibility! Young as it is, this child, we already recognize that it possesses one radiant attribute which signalizes it beyond all its elder sisters. And the lawgivers will not see this marvelous attribute, lest their laws should be thrown to the winds. This childit  floats on air ! It touches not the earth with its feet. It knows no law of gravitation. It is wellnigh incorporeal. Its material is transparent. It is sonorous air. It is almost Nature herself. It isfree! But freedom is something that mankind have never wholly comprehended, never realized to the full. They can neither recognize nor acknowledge it. They disavow the mission of this child; they hang weights upon it. This buoyant creature must walk decently, like anybody else. It may scarcely be allowed to leapwhen it were its joy to follow the line of the rainbow, and to break sunbeams with the clouds. [ 9 ]     Through this writing, as well as personal contact, Busoni had a profound effect on many musicians and composers, perhaps most notably on his pupil,  Edgard Varse , who said:     Together we used to discuss what direction the music of the future would, or rather, should take and could not take as long as the straitjacket of the tempered system. He deplored that his own keyboard instrument had conditioned our ears to accept only an infinitesimal part of the infinite gradations of sounds in nature. He was very much interested in the electrical instruments we began to hear about, and I remember particularly one he had read of called the Dynamophone. All through his writings one finds over and over again predictions about the music of the future which have since come true. In fact, there is hardly a development that he did not foresee, as for instance in this extraordinary prophecy: 'I almost think that in the new great music, machines will also be necessary and will be assigned a share in it. Perhaps industry, too, will bring forth her share in the artistic ascent. [ 10 ]         The Futurists       Main article:  Futurism               Luigi Russolo  with his assistant Ugo Piatti and their Intonarumori (noise machines)       In  Italy , the  Futurists  were coming at the changing aesthetic from a different angle, but one that also affected the world of classical music. A major thrust of the Futurist philosophy was to value ""noise,"" and to place artistic and expressive value on sounds that had previously not been considered even remotely musical. Balilla Pratella's ""Technical Manifesto of Futurist Music"" (1911) states that their credo is:     To present the musical soul of the masses, of the great factories, of the railways, of the transatlantic liners, of the battleships, of the automobiles and airplanes. To add to the great central themes of the musical poem the domain of the machine and the victorious kingdom of Electricity.| [ 11 ]     In 1914, futurist  Luigi Russolo  held the first ""art-of-noises"" concert in Milan on April 21. This used his Intonarumori, described by Russolo as ""acoustical noise-instruments, whose sounds (howls, roars, shuffles, gurgles, etc.) were hand-activated and projected by horns and megaphones."" [ 12 ]  In June, similar concerts were held in Paris.       The 19201930s   This decade brought a wealth of early electronic instruments. Along with the Theremin, there is the presentation of the  Ondes Martenot [ 13 ] , which was designed to reproduce the microtonal sounds found in Hindu music, [ citation needed ]  and the  Trautonium . Maurice Martenot invented the Ondes Martenot in 1928, and soon demonstrated it in Paris.   Another development, which aroused the interest of many composers, occurred in 19191920. In Leningrad, Leon Theremin (actually  Lev Termen ) built and demonstrated his Etherophone, which was later renamed the  Theremin . This led to the first compositions for electronic instruments, as opposed to noisemakers and re-purposed machines. In 1929,  Joseph Schillinger  composed  First Airphonic Suite for Theremin and Orchestra , premired with the  Cleveland Orchestra  with  Leon Theremin  as soloist.   In 1924,  Ottorino Respighi  composed  The Pines of Rome , which calls for the use of a phonograph recording of nightingales. However, at the time of composition, phonograph players were acoustical, not electric, and this is actually more along the lines of using a sound effect, and therefore cannot be considered an electroacoustic element in the composition.   The following year,  Antheil  first composed for mechanical devices, electrical noisemakers, motors and amplifiers in his unfinished opera,  Mr. Bloom , as a response to the ""art of noises"" of  Luigi Russolo ,  Marinetti  and the other Futurists. [ citation needed ]  And just one year later in 1926, was the premire of Antheil's  Ballet Mcanique , using car horns, airplane propellers, saws, and anvils (but no electronics).   Recording of sounds made a leap in 1927, when American inventor J. A. O'Neill developed a recording device that used magnetically coated ribbon. However, this was a commercial failure. Two years later,  Laurens Hammond  established his company for the manufacture of electronic instruments. He went on to produce the  Hammond organ , which was based on the principles of the  Telharmonium , along with other developments including early reverberation units. [ 14 ] [ citation needed ]   The method of photo-optic sound recording used in cinematography made it possible to obtain a visible image of a sound wave, as well as to realize the opposite goalsynthesizing a sound from an artificially drawn sound wave. The research work by the Russian optical engineer Evgeny Murzin [ citation needed ]  taken from 1937 to 1957 [ citation needed ]  made it possible to create a photoelectric synthesizera musical instrument that combined three processes: creation, recording, and playback of music. Murzin named his invention in honour of the composer Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin (ANS).

Whereas  Wire recorders  had been in use since 1898, the first practical tape recorder was called the  Magnetophon  (Angus 1984.) [ citation needed ]  It wasn't long before composers used the tape recorder to develop a new technique for composition called  Musique concrte . This technique involved editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. [ 15 ]  The first pieces of  musique concrte  were written by  Pierre Schaeffer , who later worked together with  Pierre Henry .   On  5 October   1948 ,  Radiodiffusion Franaise  (RDF) broadcast composer  Pierre Schaeffer 's  Etude aux chemins de fer . This was the first "" movement "" of  Cinq tudes de bruits , and marked the beginning of studio realizations and  musique concrte  (or  acousmatic music ). Schaeffer employed a disk-cutting  lathe , four turntables, a four-channel mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile recording unit.   Not long after this, Pierre Henry began collaborating with Schaeffer, a collaboration that was to have profound and lasting affects on the progression of electronic music. Also associated with Schaeffer,  Edgard Varse  began work on  Dserts  for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer's studio, and were later revised at Columbia University.   In 1950, Schaeffer gave the first public (non-broadcast) concert of musique concrte at the  Ecole Normale de Musique de Paris . ""Schaeffer used a PA  "

(May 2008)       An  electronic musical instrument  is a  musical instrument  that produces its sounds using  electronics . In contrast, the term  electric instrument  is used to mean instruments whose sound is produced mechanically, and only amplified or altered electronically - for example an  electric guitar .   An electronic instrument may include a  user interface  for controlling its sound, often by adjusting the  pitch ,  frequency , or duration of each  note . However, it is increasingly common for the user interface and sound-generating functions to be separated into a  music controller  ( input device ) and a  music synthesizer , respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as  MIDI  or  OSC .   All electric and electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of  audio signal processing  applications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called  sound effects ; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often hazy.   French  composer  and engineer  Edgard Varse  created a variety of compositions using  electronic horns , whistles, and tape. Most notably, he wrote  Pome lectronique  for the Phillips pavilion at the  Brussels World Fair  in 1958.   Electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. The development of new electronic musical instruments, controllers, and synthesizers continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research. Specialized conferences, notably the International Conference on  New interfaces for musical expression , have organized to report cutting edge work, as well as to provide a showcase for artists who perform or create music with new electronic music instruments, controllers, and synthesizers.

In the 18th-century, a number of acoustic instruments were adapted by composers in order to exploit the novelty of electricity. Thus, in the broadest sense, the first electrified musical instrument was the  Denis d'or , dating from 1753, followed shortly by the  Clavecin lectrique  by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste de Laborde in 1761. The former instrument consisted of a keyboard instrument of over 700 strings, electrified temporarily in order to enhance the instrument's sonic qualities. The later was a keyboard instrument the plectra of which were activated by electric circuitry.   In 1878,  Thomas A. Edison  patented the phonograph, which used cylinders similar to Scott's device. Although cylinders continued in use for some time,  Emile Berliner  developed the disc phonograph in 1887. [ 1 ]   A significant invention, which was later to have a profound effect on electronic music, was  Lee DeForest 's triode  audion . This was the first thermionic valve, or  vacuum tube , invented in 1906, which led to the generation and amplification of electrical signals, radio broadcastng, and electronic computation, amongst other things.     [ edit ]   Telharmonium          Telharmonium console by  Thaddeus Cahill  1897           Main article:  Telharmonium       The Telharmonium was the first music synthesizer. In 1897  Thaddeus Cahill  patented an instrument called the Telharmonium (or Teleharmonium, also known as the Dynamaphone). Using  tonewheels  to generate musical sounds as electrical signals by  additive synthesis , it was capable of producing any combination of notes and overtones, at any dynamic level. This technology was later used to design the  Hammond organ . Between 1901 and 1910 Cahill had three progressively larger and more complex versions made, the first weighing seven tons, the last in excess of 200 tons. Portability was managed only by rail and with the use of thirty boxcars. By 1912, public interest had waned, and Cahill's enterprise was bankrupt. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Theremin       Main article:  Theremin       Another development, which aroused the interest of many composers, occurred in 1919-1920. In Leningrad, Leon Theremin (actually  Lev Termen ) built and demonstrated his Etherophone, which was later renamed the  Theremin . This led to the first compositions for electronic instruments, as opposed to noisemakers and re-purposed machines.   Composers who ultimately utilized the Theremin included  Varse in his piece  Ecuatorial  (1934)while conductor  Leopold Stokowski  experimented with its use in arrangements from the classical repertory. [ citation needed ]  In 1929,  Joseph Schillinger  composed  First Airphonic Suite for Theremin and Orchestra , premired with the  Cleveland Orchestra  with  Leon Theremin  as soloist.     [ edit ]   Ondes Martenot           Ondes Martenot  created by  Maurice Martenot , 1928           Main article:  Ondes Martenot       The 1920s have been called the apex of the Mechanical Age and the dawning of the Electrical Age. In 1922, in Paris,  Darius Milhaud  began experiments with ""vocal transformation by phonograph speed change."" [ 3 ]  These continued until 1927.   This decade brought a wealth of early electronic instrumentsalong with the Theremin, there is the presentation of the  Ondes Martenot , which was designed to reproduce the microtonal sounds found in Hindu music, and the  Trautonium . Maurice Martenot invented the Ondes Martenot in 1928, and soon demonstrated it in Paris. Composers using the instrument ultimately include  Boulez ,  Honneger ,  Jolivet ,  Koechlin ,  Messiaen ,  Milhaud ,  Tremblay , and  Varse . In 1937, Messiaen wrote  Fte des belles eaux  for 6 ondes Martenot, and wrote solo parts for it in  Trois petites Liturgies de la Prsence Divine  (194344) and the  Turangalla-Symphonie  (194648/90).     [ edit ]   Trautonium          Mixtur- Trautonium , 1928 (revised 1952)           Main article:  Trautonium       The Trautonium was invented in 1928. It was based on the  subharmonic  scale, and the resulting sounds were often used to emulate bell or gong sounds, as in the 1950s Bayreuth productions of  Parsifal . In 1942, Richard Strauss used it for the bell- and gong-part in the Dresden premire of his  Japanese Festival Music . This new class of instruments, microtonal by nature, was only adopted slowly by composers at first, but by the early 1930s there was a burst of new works incorporating these and other electronic instruments.     [ edit ]   Hammond   Recording of sounds made a leap in 1927, when American inventor  J. A. O'Neill  developed a recording device that used magnetically coated ribbon. However, this was a commercial failure. Two years later,  Laurens Hammond  established his company for the manufacture of electronic instruments. He went on to produce the  Hammond organ , which was based on the principals of the  Telharmonium , along with other developments including early reverberation units. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Synthesizers   The most commonly used electronic instruments are  synthesizers , so-called because they artificially generate sound using techniques such as  additive ,  subtractive ,  FM  and  physical modelling synthesis  to create sounds.   Dr.  Robert Moog  introduced the first practical commercial modern music  synthesizer  with his  Moog synthesizer . This instrument used a series of tone generators with keys that would adjust the tone generators' pitch. Moog resolved to design and sell  Theremins  to gain enough money to engineer this synthesizer.   The first  digital synthesizers  were academic experiments in sound synthesis using digital computers.  FM synthesis  was developed for this purpose, as a way of generating complex sounds digitally with the smallest number of computational operations per sound sample.     [ edit ]   First electronic sound synthesizer       Main article:  Magnetophon       In 1935, another significant development was made in Germany. Allgemeine Elektrizitts Gesellschaft (AEG) demonstrated the first commercially produced  magnetic tape recorder , called the "" Magnetophon "".  Audio tape , which had the advantage of being fairly light as well as having good audio fidelity, ultimately replaced the bulkier wire recorders.   According to Dictionary.com Unabridged, the term ""electronic music"" (which, as defined in 2006 includes the tape recorder as an essential element: ""electronically produced sounds recorded on tape and arranged by the composer to form a musical composition"") first came into use during the 1930s [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Clavivox   in 1956 an important technological development was the invention of the  Clavivox   synthesizer  by  Raymond Scott  with subassembly by  Robert Moog .     [ edit ]   RCA Synthesizer          The RCA Mark II           Main article:  RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer       The  RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer  was the first programmable electronic music synthesizer and the flagship piece of equipment at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. Designed by Herbert Belar and Harry Olson at RCA, it was installed at Columbia University in 1957. Consisting of a room-sized array of interconnected sound synthesis components, much of the design of the machine was contributed by Vladimir Ussachevsky and Peter Mauzey.     [ edit ]   Mini-Moog          Robert Moog           Main article:  Minimoog       In 1970,  Charles Wuorinen  composed  Time's Encomium , the first Pulitzer Prize winner for an entirely electronic composition. Also in the 1970s, the  Mini-Moog  was created.   This was a small, integrated synthesizer that made analog synthesis easily available and affordable and became the most widely used synthesizer in both popular and electronic art music. [ 6 ]         [ edit ]   Synclavier       Main article:  Synclavier       Jon Appleton (with Jones and Alonso) invented the Dartmouth Digital Synthesizer, later to become the New England Digital Copt's  Synclavier . Barry Vercoe wrote Music 11, a next-generation music synthesis program (later evolving into  csound , which is still widely used).   In 1983,  Yamaha  introduced the first stand-alone digital synthesizer, the  DX-7 . It used frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis), first experimented with by  John Chowning  at Stanford during the late sixties. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Sound sequencer   These short few months were some of the most exciting in music history and technology, and the profundity of it was recognized at the time. It seems doubtful that electroacoustic music ever received such a wide audience again, unless one includes televised concerts by latter day rock and jazz fusion groups. Others were certainly active exploring new technology also. In that same year, 1951, former  jazz  composer  Raymond Scott  invented the first  sequencer , which consisted of hundreds of switches controlling stepping relays, timing solenoids, tone circuits and 16 individual oscillators.     [ edit ]   Computer music       Main article:  computer music       An important new development was the advent of computers for the purpose of composing music, as opposed to manipulating or creating sounds.  Iannis Xenakis  began what is called ""musique stochastique,"" or "" stochastic music ,"" which is a method of composing that employs mathematical probability systems. Different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters. Xenakis used graph paper and a ruler to aid in calculating the velocity trajectories of  glissandi  for his orchestral composition  Metastasis  (195354), but later turned to the use of computers to compose pieces like  ST/4  for string quartet and  ST/48  for orchestra (both 1962).   The impact of computers continued in 1956.  Lejaren Hiller  and  Leonard Isaacson  composed  Iliac Suite  for  string quartet , the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using  algorithmic  composition.

(May 2008)       An  electronic musical instrument  is a  musical instrument  that produces its sounds using  electronics . In contrast, the term  electric instrument  is used to mean instruments whose sound is produced mechanically, and only amplified or altered electronically - for example an  electric guitar .   An electronic instrument may include a  user interface  for controlling its sound, often by adjusting the  pitch ,  frequency , or duration of each  note . However, it is increasingly common for the user interface and sound-generating functions to be separated into a  music controller  ( input device ) and a  music synthesizer , respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as  MIDI  or  OSC .   All electric and electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of  audio signal processing  applications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called  sound effects ; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often hazy.   French  composer  and engineer  Edgard Varse  created a variety of compositions using  electronic horns , whistles, and tape. Most notably, he wrote  Pome lectronique  for the Phillips pavilion at the  Brussels World Fair  in 1958.   Electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. The development of new electronic musical instruments, controllers, and synthesizers continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research. Specialized conferences, notably the International Conference on  New interfaces for musical expression , have organized to report cutting edge work, as well as to provide a showcase for artists who perform or create music with new electronic music instruments, controllers, and synthesizers.

In the 18th-century, a number of acoustic instruments were adapted by composers in order to exploit the novelty of electricity. Thus, in the broadest sense, the first electrified musical instrument was the  Denis d'or , dating from 1753, followed shortly by the  Clavecin lectrique  by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste de Laborde in 1761. The former instrument consisted of a keyboard instrument of over 700 strings, electrified temporarily in order to enhance the instrument's sonic qualities. The later was a keyboard instrument the plectra of which were activated by electric circuitry.   In 1878,  Thomas A. Edison  patented the phonograph, which used cylinders similar to Scott's device. Although cylinders continued in use for some time,  Emile Berliner  developed the disc phonograph in 1887. [ 1 ]   A significant invention, which was later to have a profound effect on electronic music, was  Lee DeForest 's triode  audion . This was the first thermionic valve, or  vacuum tube , invented in 1906, which led to the generation and amplification of electrical signals, radio broadcastng, and electronic computation, amongst other things.     [ edit ]   Telharmonium          Telharmonium console by  Thaddeus Cahill  1897           Main article:  Telharmonium       The Telharmonium was the first music synthesizer. In 1897  Thaddeus Cahill  patented an instrument called the Telharmonium (or Teleharmonium, also known as the Dynamaphone). Using  tonewheels  to generate musical sounds as electrical signals by  additive synthesis , it was capable of producing any combination of notes and overtones, at any dynamic level. This technology was later used to design the  Hammond organ . Between 1901 and 1910 Cahill had three progressively larger and more complex versions made, the first weighing seven tons, the last in excess of 200 tons. Portability was managed only by rail and with the use of thirty boxcars. By 1912, public interest had waned, and Cahill's enterprise was bankrupt. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Theremin       Main article:  Theremin       Another development, which aroused the interest of many composers, occurred in 1919-1920. In Leningrad, Leon Theremin (actually  Lev Termen ) built and demonstrated his Etherophone, which was later renamed the  Theremin . This led to the first compositions for electronic instruments, as opposed to noisemakers and re-purposed machines.   Composers who ultimately utilized the Theremin included  Varse in his piece  Ecuatorial  (1934)while conductor  Leopold Stokowski  experimented with its use in arrangements from the classical repertory. [ citation needed ]  In 1929,  Joseph Schillinger  composed  First Airphonic Suite for Theremin and Orchestra , premired with the  Cleveland Orchestra  with  Leon Theremin  as soloist.     [ edit ]   Ondes Martenot           Ondes Martenot  created by  Maurice Martenot , 1928           Main article:  Ondes Martenot       The 1920s have been called the apex of the Mechanical Age and the dawning of the Electrical Age. In 1922, in Paris,  Darius Milhaud  began experiments with ""vocal transformation by phonograph speed change."" [ 3 ]  These continued until 1927.   This decade brought a wealth of early electronic instrumentsalong with the Theremin, there is the presentation of the  Ondes Martenot , which was designed to reproduce the microtonal sounds found in Hindu music, and the  Trautonium . Maurice Martenot invented the Ondes Martenot in 1928, and soon demonstrated it in Paris. Composers using the instrument ultimately include  Boulez ,  Honneger ,  Jolivet ,  Koechlin ,  Messiaen ,  Milhaud ,  Tremblay , and  Varse . In 1937, Messiaen wrote  Fte des belles eaux  for 6 ondes Martenot, and wrote solo parts for it in  Trois petites Liturgies de la Prsence Divine  (194344) and the  Turangalla-Symphonie  (194648/90).     [ edit ]   Trautonium          Mixtur- Trautonium , 1928 (revised 1952)           Main article:  Trautonium       The Trautonium was invented in 1928. It was based on the  subharmonic  scale, and the resulting sounds were often used to emulate bell or gong sounds, as in the 1950s Bayreuth productions of  Parsifal . In 1942, Richard Strauss used it for the bell- and gong-part in the Dresden premire of his  Japanese Festival Music . This new class of instruments, microtonal by nature, was only adopted slowly by composers at first, but by the early 1930s there was a burst of new works incorporating these and other electronic instruments.     [ edit ]   Hammond   Recording of sounds made a leap in 1927, when American inventor  J. A. O'Neill  developed a recording device that used magnetically coated ribbon. However, this was a commercial failure. Two years later,  Laurens Hammond  established his company for the manufacture of electronic instruments. He went on to produce the  Hammond organ , which was based on the principals of the  Telharmonium , along with other developments including early reverberation units. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Synthesizers   The most commonly used electronic instruments are  synthesizers , so-called because they artificially generate sound using techniques such as  additive ,  subtractive ,  FM  and  physical modelling synthesis  to create sounds.   Dr.  Robert Moog  introduced the first practical commercial modern music  synthesizer  with his  Moog synthesizer . This instrument used a series of tone generators with keys that would adjust the tone generators' pitch. Moog resolved to design and sell  Theremins  to gain enough money to engineer this synthesizer.   The first  digital synthesizers  were academic experiments in sound synthesis using digital computers.  FM synthesis  was developed for this purpose, as a way of generating complex sounds digitally with the smallest number of computational operations per sound sample.     [ edit ]   First electronic sound synthesizer       Main article:  Magnetophon       In 1935, another significant development was made in Germany. Allgemeine Elektrizitts Gesellschaft (AEG) demonstrated the first commercially produced  magnetic tape recorder , called the "" Magnetophon "".  Audio tape , which had the advantage of being fairly light as well as having good audio fidelity, ultimately replaced the bulkier wire recorders.   According to Dictionary.com Unabridged, the term ""electronic music"" (which, as defined in 2006 includes the tape recorder as an essential element: ""electronically produced sounds recorded on tape and arranged by the composer to form a musical composition"") first came into use during the 1930s [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Clavivox   in 1956 an important technological development was the invention of the  Clavivox   synthesizer  by  Raymond Scott  with subassembly by  Robert Moog .     [ edit ]   RCA Synthesizer          The RCA Mark II           Main article:  RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer       The  RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer  was the first programmable electronic music synthesizer and the flagship piece of equipment at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. Designed by Herbert Belar and Harry Olson at RCA, it was installed at Columbia University in 1957. Consisting of a room-sized array of interconnected sound synthesis components, much of the design of the machine was contributed by Vladimir Ussachevsky and Peter Mauzey.     [ edit ]   Mini-Moog          Robert Moog           Main article:  Minimoog       In 1970,  Charles Wuorinen  composed  Time's Encomium , the first Pulitzer Prize winner for an entirely electronic composition. Also in the 1970s, the  Mini-Moog  was created.   This was a small, integrated synthesizer that made analog synthesis easily available and affordable and became the most widely used synthesizer in both popular and electronic art music. [ 6 ]         [ edit ]   Synclavier       Main article:  Synclavier       Jon Appleton (with Jones and Alonso) invented the Dartmouth Digital Synthesizer, later to become the New England Digital Copt's  Synclavier . Barry Vercoe wrote Music 11, a next-generation music synthesis program (later evolving into  csound , which is still widely used).   In 1983,  Yamaha  introduced the first stand-alone digital synthesizer, the  DX-7 . It used frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis), first experimented with by  John Chowning  at Stanford during the late sixties. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Sound sequencer   These short few months were some of the most exciting in music history and technology, and the profundity of it was recognized at the time. It seems doubtful that electroacoustic music ever received such a wide audience again, unless one includes televised concerts by latter day rock and jazz fusion groups. Others were certainly active exploring new technology also. In that same year, 1951, former  jazz  composer  Raymond Scott  invented the first  sequencer , which consisted of hundreds of switches controlling stepping relays, timing solenoids, tone circuits and 16 individual oscillators.     [ edit ]   Computer music       Main article:  computer music       An important new development was the advent of computers for the purpose of composing music, as opposed to manipulating or creating sounds.  Iannis Xenakis  began what is called ""musique stochastique,"" or "" stochastic music ,"" which is a method of composing that employs mathematical probability systems. Different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters. Xenakis used graph paper and a ruler to aid in calculating the velocity trajectories of  glissandi  for his orchestral composition  Metastasis  (195354), but later turned to the use of computers to compose pieces like  ST/4  for string quartet and  ST/48  for orchestra (both 1962).   The impact of computers continued in 1956.  Lejaren Hiller  and  Leonard Isaacson  composed  Iliac Suite  for  string quartet , the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using  algorithmic  composition. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Hardware hacking       Main article:  circuit bending       It was within this period (1966-67) that  Reed Ghazala  discovered and began to teach "" circuit bending ""the application of the creative short circuit, a process of chance short-circuiting, creating experimental electronic instruments, exploring sonic elements mainly of timbre and with less regard to pitch or rhythm, and influenced by  John Cage s  aleatoric music  concept. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   MIDI technology       Main article:  Musical Instrument Digital Interface       In 1980, a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface by which new instruments could communicate control instructions with other instruments and the prevalent microcomputer. This standard was dubbed MIDI ( Musical Instrument Digital Interface ). A paper was authored by  Dave Smith  of  Sequential Circuits  and proposed to the  Audio Engineering Society  in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.   The advent of MIDI technology allows a single keystroke, control wheel motion, pedal movement, or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and in synchrony, with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer.   MIDI instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals. Acoustic sounds became reintegrated into studios via  sampling  and sampled-ROM-based instruments.   Miller Puckette  developed graphic signal-processing software for 4X called  Max  (after  Max Mathews ) and later ported it to  Macintosh  (with  Dave Zicarelli  extending it for  Opcode   [ 10 ] ) for real-time MIDI control, bringing algorithmic composition availability to most composers with modest computer programming background.

clueweb09-enwp01-34-16693	"                     Optimus Maximus keyboard          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    The  factual accuracy  of this article or section may be compromised due to out-of-date information.   You can  improve the article  by updating it. There may be information on the  talk page .       The  Optimus Maximus keyboard , previously just ""Optimus keyboard"", is a  keyboard  developed by the  Art. Lebedev Studio , a Russian design studio headed by  Artemy Lebedev . Each of its keys is a  display  which can dynamically change to adapt to the  keyboard layout  in use or to show the function of the key. Pre-orders began on  20 May   2007  for a limited production run from December 2007 to January 2008, with a second batch expected to arrive in February 2008. It first started shipping the week of February 21, 2008.           Contents       1   Overview     1.1   Optimus mini three   1.2   Optimus Aux   1.3   Production schedule   1.4   Variations       2   Similar keyboards   3   Special features   4   Reviews   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Overview           Photoshop  layout (Mac, prototype rendering)               Quake III Arena  layout. The production model uses the same 48x48 display for all keys including the space bar, unlike this rendering.       The design featured on the studio's website received attention on the web when it was featured on  Slashdot  on  14 July   2005 , and afterwards for a few weeks on other technology websites. The original release date was ""end of 2006"", however production issues caused the  Optimus mini three  to be developed first, with the full keyboard delayed until the end of 2007. The keyboard was number 10 in the  Wired Magazine  2006  Vaporware Awards [ 1 ]  and number 4 on the list in 2007 [ 2 ]  due to its numerous delays and feature reductions.   The Optimus allows for greater  user interaction , by dynamically displaying the current function of the keys. For example, when the user presses the  shift key , the pictures would change to upper-case versions. It would also make switching between different keyboard layouts (such as  English  and  Cyrillic ) rapid, and could make the switch to alternative layouts such as  Dvorak  easier for people who only have a  QWERTY  keyboard with no possibility of rearranging the keys. To demonstrate this concept, there are computer renderings showing example layouts for  Quake III Arena  and  Adobe Photoshop .   A newly-revealed (as of January 3, 2008) patent application filed on March 13, 2007 suggests that  Apple Inc.  may be working on a similar dynamically changeable OLED keyboard. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus mini three       Main article:  Optimus mini three       Art. Lebedev Studio has released a smaller three-key version of their keyboard, named  Optimus mini three . Each of the keys is larger than a standard key. The mini three can be adjusted, through the configuration software, to either a horizontal or vertical orientation.   Initial reviews have been mixed. The keyboard functions as advertised, but it has been criticized for inordinately high CPU usage, slow response time, and buggy configuration software. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus Aux   On  July 21 ,  2008 ,  Engadget  posted about a new version of the keyboard, named Optimus Pultius. It features 15 OLED keys in a three-by-five arrangement and a USB port. It is expected to be released in late 2008 or early 2009. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On  September 19 , 2008, Engadget also reported that the Pultius had been renamed to the Aux [ 8 ]  and included a new rendering of the rear side showing that there would be two USB ports instead of one. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Production schedule   Some reports indicate that the keyboards started shipping on February 21, 2008. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Variations   Variations with fewer OLED keys will also be available, each upgradeable by replacing static keys with OLED keys after purchase. For keyboards with less than a full complement of OLED ""active keys"", additional keys can be purchased and installed. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Similar keyboards   The patent for this ""Display Keyboard"" ( U.S. Patent 5,818,361   ) is held by inventor Elkin Acevedo. [1]  However, the first programmable LCD keyboard  [2]  was developed in the mid-1980s in Germany. This keyboard, sold under the LCBoard name in the U.S. until 1999, contained many of the features of the Optimus keyboard including monochrome graphic icons on each keyboard key, macro programming, context sensitive and application dependent switching between functions.     [ edit ]   Special features   Art. Lebedev Studio is expecting to manufacture the keyboard with these features: [3]     A plastic body (width: 537 mm, depth: 173 mm, height: 38 mm)   Extra-durable  polymer   plastic  keys (20.220.2 mm, visible area 10.110.1 mm)   4848  pixel  screens,  Highcolor  mode (65 536 colors, 10 FPS)   OLED  (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screen for keys   USB 2.0  (or 1.1) connectivity   4-5 year lifetime   A  key-saver  mode   Support for animation on keys at 10  FPS  minimum   Ability to form a mosaic using a combination of key images   Compatibility with  Windows XP ,  Windows Vista  and  Mac OS X  10.5.1 (and higher).   An  SDK  for complete display customization   Swappable keys and support for keys without displays   32  MB   SD card  for storing basic layouts   Non-stop glow time at nominal brightness of 20,000 hours, after which display quality will diminish   An ambient light sensor which can be used to automatically adjust display brightness   A  viewing angle  of 160       [ edit ]   Reviews   Engadget  has published early impressions of the keyboard, approving of the quality of the displays, the build quality of the keyboard, and the customisation software. However, they note that the keys' high resistance means that it is tiring to type on (exhausting the author in ""30 seconds to a minute""), and therefore ""it's better off used as an absurdly configurable Swiss army knife"".

In  computing , a  keyboard  is an  input device , partially modeled after the  typewriter keyboard , which uses an arrangement of buttons or  keys , which act as electronic switches. A keyboard typically has characters  engraved  or  printed  on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written  symbol . However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce  letters ,  numbers  or  signs  ( characters ), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or computer commands.   In normal usage, the keyboard is used to type text or numbers into a  word processor ,  text editor  or other program. In a modern computer, the interpretation of keypresses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all keypresses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either with regular keyboards or by using special  gaming keyboards , which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as  Windows '  Control-Alt-Delete  combination, which brings up a task window or shuts down the machine.

The internationally-common 102/105 key keyboards have a smaller 'left shift' key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Gaming and multimedia   Keyboards with extra keys, such as multimedia keyboards, have special keys for accessing music, web and other oft-used programs, a  mute  button,  volume  buttons or  knob  and standby (sleep) button.  Gaming  keyboards have extra function keys, which can be programmed with keystroke macros. For example, 'ctrl+shift+y' could be a keystroke that is frequently used in a certain computer game. Shortcuts marked on color-coded keys are used for some software applications and for specialized for uses including word processing,  video editing ,  graphic design  and  audio editing .     [ edit ]   Thumb-sized          Wireless keyboard with a  Windows  button and  multimedia  keys on the top.       Smaller keyboards have been introduced for laptops, PDAs, cellphones or users who have a limited workspace. The size of a standard keyboard is dictated by the practical consideration that the keys must be large enough to be easily pressed by fingers. To reduce the size of the keyboard, the numeric keyboard to the right of the alphabetic keyboard can be removed, or the size of the keys can be reduced, which makes it harder to enter text. Another way to reduce the size of the keyboard is to reduce the number of keys and use  chording   keyer , i.e. pressing several keys simultaneously. For example, the  GKOS keyboard  has been designed for small wireless devices. Other two-handed alternatives more akin to a  game controller , such as the  AlphaGrip , are also used as a way to input data and text. Another way to reduce the size of a keyboard is to use smaller buttons and pack them closer together. Such keyboards, often called a "" thumbboard "" (thumbing) are used in some  personal digital assistants  such as the  Palm Treo  and  BlackBerry  and some  Ultra-Mobile PCs  such as the  OQO .     [ edit ]   Numeric   Numeric keyboards contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, and several function keys (e.g. End, Delete, etc.). They are often used to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboard-equipped laptops or with smaller keyboards that do not have a numeric keypad.     [ edit ]   Non-standard or special-use types     [ edit ]   Chorded          A  foldable  keyboard.       A keyset or  chorded keyboard  is a computer input device that allows the user to enter characters or commands formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a ""chord"" on a piano. The large number of combinations available from a small number of keys allows text or commands to be entered with one hand, leaving the other hand free to do something else. A secondary advantage is that it can be built into a device (such as a pocket-sized computer) that is too small to contain a normal sized keyboard. A chorded keyboard designed to be used while held in the hand is called a keyer.     [ edit ]   Virtual   Virtual keyboards, such as the I-Tech Virtual  Laser Keyboard , project an image of a full-size keyboard onto a surface.  Sensors  in the projection unit identify which key is being ""pressed"" and relay the signals to a computer or  personal digital assistant . There is also a virtual keyboard, the On-Screen Keyboard, for use on Windows.     [ edit ]   Touchscreens   Touchscreens, such as with the  iPhone  and the  OLPC  laptop, can be used as a keyboard. (The  OLPC  initiative's second computer will be effectively two tablet touchscreens hinged together like a book. It can be used as a convertible  Tablet PC  where the keyboard is one half-screen (one side of the book) which turns into a touchscreen virtual keyboard.)     [ edit ]   Foldable   Foldable keyboards are made of soft plastic which can be rolled or folded over for travel. When in use, the keyboard can conform to uneven surfaces, and it is more resistant to liquids than a standard keyboard. Some models can be fully immersed in water, making them popular in hospitals and laboratories, as they can be disinfected.     [ edit ]   Layout     [ edit ]   Alphabetic   Main article:  Keyboard layout          The 104-key PC  US   English   QWERTY  keyboard layout evolved from the standard  typewriter  keyboard, with extra keys for computing.              The  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  layout arranges keys so that frequently used keys are easiest to press, which reduces muscle fatigue when typing common English.       There are a number of different arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different  keyboard layouts  arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, either because they are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting,  computer programming , or other purposes. Most of the more common keyboard layouts ( QWERTY -based and similar) were designed in the era of the mechanical typewriters, so their ergonomics had to be slightly compromised in order to tackle some of the mechanical limitations of the typewriter. As the letter-keys were attached to levers that needed to move freely, inventor  Christopher Sholes  developed the QWERTY layout to reduce the likelihood of jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, QWERTY layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as the  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  are not in widespread use.   The QWERTZ layout is fairly widely used in Germany and much of Central Europe. The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped, and most special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters. Another situation takes place with national layouts. Keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release the space for  ; similarly, those for French and other European languages may have a special key for the character   . The AZERTY layout is used in France, Belgium and some neighbouring countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout in that the A and Q are swapped, the Z and W are swapped, and the M is moved from the right of N to the right of L (where colon/semicolon is on a US keyboard). The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters.   Keyboards designed for non-English speaking markets may have special keys to switch between non-English typing and the Roman alphabet and vice-versa. In Japan, keyboards often can be switched between Japanese and the Roman alphabet, and the character  (the Yen currency) is used instead of ""\"". In Israel, keyboards can often be switched between Hebrew and English. In bilingual regions of Canada and in the French-speaking province of Quebec, keyboards can often be switched between an English and a French-language keyboard; while both keyboards share the same QWERTY alphabetic layout, the French-language keyboard enables the user to type accented vowels such as """" or """" with a single keystroke. Using keyboards for other languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the keys, because the standard keyboard layouts do not share even similar characters of different languages (see the example in the figure above).     [ edit ]   Key types     [ edit ]   Alphanumeric          A  Hebrew keyboard  lets the user type in both  Hebrew  and the  Latin alphabet .       Alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys are used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed at the same time as some modifier keys.   The  Space bar  is a horizontal bar in the lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses in addition to its normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.     [ edit ]   Modifiers          A  Space-cadet keyboard  has many modifier keys.       Modifier keys  are special keys that modify the normal action of another key, when the two are pressed in combination. For example, <Alt> + <F4> in Microsoft Windows will close the program in an active window. In contrast, pressing just <F4> will probably do nothing, unless assigned a specific function in a particular program. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing. The most widely-used modifier keys include the  Control key ,  Shift key  and the  Alt key . The  AltGr key  is used to access additional symbols for keys, that have three symbols printed on them. On the Macintosh and Apple keyboards, the modifier keys are the  Option key  and  Command key , respectively. On MIT computer keyboards, the  Meta key  is used as a modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a  Windows key . Compact  keyboard layouts  often use a  Fn key . "" Dead keys "" allow placement of a  diacritic  mark, such as an accent, on the following letter (e.g., the  Compose key ).   The  Enter/Return key  typically causes a command line, window form or dialog box to operate its default function, which is typically to finish an ""entry"" and begin the desired process. In word processing applications, pressing the enter key ends a paragraph and starts a new one.     [ edit ]   Navigation and typing mode   Navigation keys include a variety of keys which move the cursor to different positions on the screen.  Arrow keys  are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the ' Page Up and Page Down keys ', scroll the page up and down. The  Home  key is used to return the cursor to the beginning of the line where the cursor is located; the  End key  puts the cursor at the end of the line. The  Tab key  advances the cursor to the next tab stop.   The  Insert key  is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The  Delete key  discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position ""back"" towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The  Backspace  key deletes the preceding character.   Lock keys  lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numpad. The lock keys include  Scroll lock ,  Num lock  (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and  Caps lock .     [ edit ]   System commands   The  SysRq  /  Print screen  commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a ""panic"" button to recover from crashes. The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but nowadays it usually puts a screenshot in the  clipboard . The  Break key/Pause key  no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teletype users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection. In programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties.   The  Escape key  (often abbreviated Esc) is used to initiate an escape sequence. As most computer users no longer are concerned with the details of controlling their computer's peripherals, the task for which the escape sequences were originally designed, the escape key was appropriated by application programmers, most often to mean Stop. This use continues today in Microsoft Windows's use of escape as a shortcut in dialog boxes for No, Quit, Exit, Cancel, or Abort. A common application today of the Esc key is as a shortcut key for the Stop button in many web browsers. On machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the ""start"" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows XP and Windows Vista.   The  Menu key  or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards. It is used launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 keyboard shortcut).     [ edit ]   Miscellaneous   Many, but not all, computer keyboards have a  numeric keypad  to the right of the alphabetic keyboard. On  Japanese/Korean keyboards , there may be  Language input keys . Some keyboards have  power management keys  (e.g.,  Power key ,  Sleep key  and  Wake key ); internet keys to access a web browser or  E-mail ; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls.     [ edit ]   Technology     [ edit ]   Key switches          Keyboards on laptops such as this  Sony   VAIO  usually have a shorter travel distance for the keystroke and a reduced set of keys.       "" Dome-switch "" keyboards (sometimes incorrectly referred to as a  membrane keyboards ) are the most common type in use in the 2000s. When a key is pressed, it pushes down on a rubber dome sitting beneath the key. A  conductive  contact on the underside of the dome touches (and hence connects) a pair of conductive lines on the circuit below. This bridges the gap between them and allows  electric current  to flow (the open  circuit  is closed). A scanning signal is emitted by the chip along the pairs of lines in the  matrix circuit  which connects to all the keys. When the signal in one pair becomes different, the chip generates a ""make code"" corresponding to the key connected to that pair of lines.   Keycaps  are also required for most types of keyboards; while modern keycaps are typically surface-marked, they can also be  2-shot molded,  or engraved, or they can be made of transparent material with printed paper inserts   Keys on older IBM keyboards were made with a  ""buckling spring""  mechanism, in which a coil spring under the key buckles under pressure from the user's finger, pressing a rubber dome, whose inside is coated with conductive graphite, which connects two leads below, completing a circuit. This produces a clicking sound, and gives physical feedback for the typist indicating that the key has been depressed. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] When a key is pressed and the circuit is completed, the code generated is sent to the computer either via a keyboard cable (using on-off electrical pulses to represent  bits ) or over a  wireless  connection.   A chip inside the computer receives the signal bits and decodes them into the appropriate keypress. The computer then decides what to do on the basis of the key pressed (e.g. display a character on the screen, or perform some action). When the key is released, a break code (different from the make code) is sent to indicate the key is no longer pressed. If the break code is missed (e.g. due to a keyboard switch) it is possible for the keyboard controller to believe the key is pressed down when it is not, which is why pressing then releasing the key again will release the key (since another break code is sent). Other types of keyboards function in a similar manner, the main differences being how the individual key-switches work. For more on this subject refer to the article on  keyboard technology .   Certain key presses are special, namely  Ctrl-Alt-Delete  and  SysRq , but what makes them special is a function of software. In the PC architecture, the keyboard controller (the component in the computer that receives the make and break codes) sends the computer's CPU a hardware  interrupt  whenever a key is pressed or released. The CPU's interrupt routine which handles these interrupts usually just places the key's code in a queue, to be handled later by other code when it gets around to it, then returns to whatever the computer was doing before. The special keys cause the interrupt routine to take a different ""emergency"" exit instead. This more trusted route is much harder to intercept.   The layout of a keyboard can be changed by remapping the keys. When you remap a key, you tell the computer a new meaning for the pressing of that key. Keyboard remapping is supported at a driver-level configurable within the operating system, or as add-ons to the existing programs. For Windows, Microsoft provides a downloadable tool called  Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator , and there are several other software programs, including  SharpKeys  and  KeyTweak .     [ edit ]   Control processor   The modern PC keyboard has more than just switches. It also includes a control processor and indicator lights to provide feedback to the user about what state the keyboard is in. Depending on the sophistication of the controller's programming, the keyboard may also offer other special features. The processor is usually a single chip  8048   microcontroller  variant. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs and it processes the incoming keystrokes and sends the results down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to a receiver in the main computer box. It also controls the illumination of the "" caps lock "", "" num lock "" and "" scroll lock "" lights.   A common test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the ""caps lock"" key. The keyboard sends the key code to the  keyboard driver  running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the  shift ,  alt  and  control  state of the keyboard.   When pressing a keyboard key, the key ""bounces"" like a ball against its contacts several times before it settles into firm contact. When released, it bounces some more until it reverts to the uncontacted state. If the computer were watching for each pulse, it would see many keystrokes for what the user thought was just one. To resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard (or computer) "" debounces "" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one ""confirmed"" keystroke that (usually) corresponds to what is typically a solid contact.   Some low-quality keyboards suffer problems with  rollover  (that is, when multiple keys are pressed in quick succession); some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. This is undesirable for  games  (designed for multiple keypresses, e.g. casting a spell while holding down keys to run) and undesirable for extremely fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys). A common side effect of this shortcoming is called ""phantom key blocking"": on some keyboards, pressing three keys simultaneously sometimes resulted in a 4th keypress being registered. Modern keyboards prevent this from happening by blocking the 3rd key in certain key combinations, but while this prevents phantom input, it also means that when two keys are depressed simultaneously, many of the other keys on the keyboard will not respond until one of the two depressed keys is lifted. With better keyboards designs, this seldom happens in office programs, but it remains a problem in games even on expensive keyboards, due to wildly different and/or configurable key/command layouts in different games.     [ edit ]   Connection types   There are several ways of connecting a keyboard using cables, including the standard AT connector commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the  PS/2  and the  USB  connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary  Apple Desktop Bus  for its keyboard connector.   Wireless  keyboards have become popular for their increased user freedom. A wireless keyboard often includes a required combination transmitter and receiver unit that attaches to the computer's keyboard port (see  Connection types  above). The wireless aspect is achieved either by  radio frequency  (RF) or by  infrared  (IR) signals sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer. A wireless keyboard may use an industry standard RF, called  Bluetooth . With Bluetooth, the transceiver may be built into the computer. However, a wireless keyboard needs batteries to work and may pose a security problem due to the risk of data "" eavesdropping "" by hackers. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Alternative text-entering methods          An on-screen keyboard controlled with the mouse can be used by users with limited mobility.       Optical character recognition  (OCR) is preferable to rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a  Linotype -composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of  character  codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example,  Google Book Search ) and promises more for the future.   Speech recognition  converts speech into machine-readable text (that is, a string of character codes). The technology has already reached an impressive state and is already implemented in  various software products . For certain uses (e.g., transcription of medical or legal dictation; journalism; writing essays or novels) it is starting to replace the keyboard; however, it does not threaten to replace keyboards entirely anytime soon. It can, however, interpret commands (for example, ""close window"" or ""undo that"") in addition to text. Therefore, it has theoretical potential to replace keyboards entirely (whereas OCR replaces them only for a certain kind of task).   Pointing devices  can be used to enter text or characters in contexts where using a physical keyboard would be inappropriate or impossible. These accessories typically present characters on a display, in a layout that provides fast access to the more frequently used characters or character combinations. Popular examples of this kind of input are  Graffiti ,  Dasher  and on-screen  virtual keyboards . FITALY ( http://www.FITALY.com ) is a stylus/one-finger keyboard that can yield 50+ WPM. The key is to stare at the keyboard, not the screen (as in traditional touch typing). No memorization of layout is required. It is engineered for rapid text input (e.g., some 85% of English words are visible at the center of the keyboard). It is available for many mobile and laptop devices.     [ edit ]   Other issues     [ edit ]   Keystroke hacking   Keystroke logging  (often called keylogging) is a method of capturing and recording user keystrokes. While it is used legitimately to measure employee productivity on certain clerical tasks, or by law enforcement agencies to find out about illegal activities, it is also used by hackers for law-breaking. Hackers use keyloggers as a means to obtain passwords or encryption keys and thus bypassing other security measures.   Keystroke logging can be achieved by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computers operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.   Anti-spyware  applications are able to detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by  anti-spyware  programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a  firewall  does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured.  Network monitors  (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from ""phoning home"" with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window.  [ 5 ]   Electromagnetic waves released every time key is pressed on the keyboard can be detected by a nearby antenna and interpreted by computer software to work out exactly what was typed.  [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Physical injury          Proper ergonomic design of computer keyboard desks is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries, which can develop over time and can lead to long-term disability. [ 7 ]       The use of any keyboard may cause serious injury (that is,  carpal tunnel syndrome  or other  repetitive strain injury ) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks to get up and walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.   Some  Adaptive technology  ranging from special keyboards, mouse replacements and pen tablet interfaces to  speech recognition  software can reduce the risk of injury. Pause software reminds the user to pause frequently. Switching to a much more ergonomic keyboard layout such as  Dvorak [ citation needed ]  or  Colemak  may reduce the risk of injury. Switching to a much more ergonomic mouse, such as a vertical mouse or joystick mouse may provide relief. Switching from using a mouse to using a stylus pen with graphic tablet or a  trackpad  such as a  Smart Cat  trackpad can lessen the repetitive strain on the arms and hands.

(February 2007)       Das Keyboard  is a high-end mechanical computer  keyboard . Its most distinctive feature is that one version has no inscriptions on the keys; that is, the keys themselves are both completely  black  and blank. The name comes from the  German  word  das  ( the  in  German ) simply translated to ""The Keyboard"". Another reference to the German language is that the keyboard targets  ber - Geeks .           Contents       1   Criticism   2   History   3   See also   4   External links               [ edit ]   Criticism   The original Das Keyboard, which was made in the  Czech Republic , has received criticism from some who feel that it is essentially just an expensive version of a standard quality  dome-switch  (""membrane"") keyboard. The 'spongy' feel of the keys has also been unfavorably compared with keyboards using  mechanical  key switches; in addition, some feel the advantage of the weighted keys has been overstated. [ citation needed ]   Das Keyboard II, which sells for twenty dollars more than the original, addresses the above criticisms of the first version. It features gold-plated and clicky mechanical key switches made by  Cherry  which are similar, but not identical, to the "" buckling spring "" type key switches in the old IBM  Model M keyboard . Das Keyboard III, which was launched in July 2008 introduced two new models, the Ultimate (blank keys) and the Professional (traditional QWERTY inscriptions). The new glossy black look, blue LEDs and the addition of a USB hub make the keyboard much more up-to-date.

Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (October 2008)       The keyboard was designed by Daniel Guermeur, the founder of Metadot Corporation, an open source software company located in Austin, Texas, USA. Daniel Guermeur noticed that hunting and pecking was not very efficient for someone spending most of his days typing on a computer. He was looking for a radical solution which would prevent him from looking at the keys. Thus he had a Chinese factory make his first blank keyboard. After a few seconds of using it, the low-cost, rubber-membrane keyboard was giving atrocious tactile feedback so he decided that blank keys were not enough to type fast; the keyboard component quality was paramount as well. He then had another factory make the best quality keyboard they could deliver and added the blank keys. After few weeks of usage Daniel doubled his typing speed.   Friends and colleagues asked him many times where they could buy a blank keyboard like his, but this was a one-of-a-kind keyboard. After he noticed a wide interest in this blank typing device he decided to launch a new product line focusing exclusively on providing the best quality keyboard equipment available on the market. The first week after the launch of the first Das Keyboard, its website got several million hits and was mentioned numerous blogs and leading newspapers including Slashdot and the New York Times.

With our 'Cumulative Product Rating' system, in order for a product to receive a rating score, it must have a minimum number of ratings to qualify.                         This system is not intended to diminish the value of products with a low number of ratings and reviews, they're great, and hopefully very helpful, but if you want our advice, we want to make sure that the product you're thinking of buying has been rated and reviewed by enough shoppers like you to be a valuable indicator of product quality.

clueweb09-enwp00-45-13877	"                     Keyboard (computing)          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Computer keyboard keys )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (October 2008)       For other uses, see  Keyboard .   In  computing , a  keyboard  is an  input device , partially modeled after the  typewriter keyboard , which uses an arrangement of buttons or  keys , which act as electronic switches. A keyboard typically has characters  engraved  or  printed  on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written  symbol . However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce  letters ,  numbers  or  signs  ( characters ), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or computer commands.   In normal usage, the keyboard is used to type text or numbers into a  word processor ,  text editor  or other program. In a modern computer, the interpretation of keypresses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all keypresses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either with regular keyboards or by using special  gaming keyboards , which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as  Windows '  Control-Alt-Delete  combination, which brings up a task window or shuts down the machine.

The internationally-common 102/105 key keyboards have a smaller 'left shift' key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Gaming and multimedia   Keyboards with extra keys, such as multimedia keyboards, have special keys for accessing music, web and other oft-used programs, a  mute  button,  volume  buttons or  knob  and standby (sleep) button.  Gaming  keyboards have extra function keys, which can be programmed with keystroke macros. For example, 'ctrl+shift+y' could be a keystroke that is frequently used in a certain computer game. Shortcuts marked on color-coded keys are used for some software applications and for specialized for uses including word processing,  video editing ,  graphic design  and  audio editing .     [ edit ]   Thumb-sized          Wireless keyboard with a  Windows  button and  multimedia  keys on the top.       Smaller keyboards have been introduced for laptops, PDAs, cellphones or users who have a limited workspace. The size of a standard keyboard is dictated by the practical consideration that the keys must be large enough to be easily pressed by fingers. To reduce the size of the keyboard, the numeric keyboard to the right of the alphabetic keyboard can be removed, or the size of the keys can be reduced, which makes it harder to enter text. Another way to reduce the size of the keyboard is to reduce the number of keys and use  chording   keyer , i.e. pressing several keys simultaneously. For example, the  GKOS keyboard  has been designed for small wireless devices. Other two-handed alternatives more akin to a  game controller , such as the  AlphaGrip , are also used as a way to input data and text. Another way to reduce the size of a keyboard is to use smaller buttons and pack them closer together. Such keyboards, often called a "" thumbboard "" (thumbing) are used in some  personal digital assistants  such as the  Palm Treo  and  BlackBerry  and some  Ultra-Mobile PCs  such as the  OQO .     [ edit ]   Numeric   Numeric keyboards contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, and several function keys (e.g. End, Delete, etc.). They are often used to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboard-equipped laptops or with smaller keyboards that do not have a numeric keypad.     [ edit ]   Non-standard or special-use types     [ edit ]   Chorded          A  foldable  keyboard.       A keyset or  chorded keyboard  is a computer input device that allows the user to enter characters or commands formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a ""chord"" on a piano. The large number of combinations available from a small number of keys allows text or commands to be entered with one hand, leaving the other hand free to do something else. A secondary advantage is that it can be built into a device (such as a pocket-sized computer) that is too small to contain a normal sized keyboard. A chorded keyboard designed to be used while held in the hand is called a keyer.     [ edit ]   Virtual   Virtual keyboards, such as the I-Tech Virtual  Laser Keyboard , project an image of a full-size keyboard onto a surface.  Sensors  in the projection unit identify which key is being ""pressed"" and relay the signals to a computer or  personal digital assistant . There is also a virtual keyboard, the On-Screen Keyboard, for use on Windows.     [ edit ]   Touchscreens   Touchscreens, such as with the  iPhone  and the  OLPC  laptop, can be used as a keyboard. (The  OLPC  initiative's second computer will be effectively two tablet touchscreens hinged together like a book. It can be used as a convertible  Tablet PC  where the keyboard is one half-screen (one side of the book) which turns into a touchscreen virtual keyboard.)     [ edit ]   Foldable   Foldable keyboards are made of soft plastic which can be rolled or folded over for travel. When in use, the keyboard can conform to uneven surfaces, and it is more resistant to liquids than a standard keyboard. Some models can be fully immersed in water, making them popular in hospitals and laboratories, as they can be disinfected.     [ edit ]   Layout     [ edit ]   Alphabetic       Main article:  Keyboard layout              The 104-key PC  US   English   QWERTY  keyboard layout evolved from the standard  typewriter  keyboard, with extra keys for computing.              The  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  layout arranges keys so that frequently used keys are easiest to press, which reduces muscle fatigue when typing common English.       There are a number of different arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different  keyboard layouts  arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, either because they are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting,  computer programming , or other purposes. Most of the more common keyboard layouts ( QWERTY -based and similar) were designed in the era of the mechanical typewriters, so their ergonomics had to be slightly compromised in order to tackle some of the mechanical limitations of the typewriter. As the letter-keys were attached to levers that needed to move freely, inventor  Christopher Sholes  developed the QWERTY layout to reduce the likelihood of jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, QWERTY layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as the  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  are not in widespread use.   The QWERTZ layout is fairly widely used in Germany and much of Central Europe. The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped, and most special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters. Another situation takes place with national layouts. Keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release the space for  ; similarly, those for French and other European languages may have a special key for the character   . The AZERTY layout is used in France, Belgium and some neighbouring countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout in that the A and Q are swapped, the Z and W are swapped, and the M is moved from the right of N to the right of L (where colon/semicolon is on a US keyboard). The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters.   Keyboards designed for non-English speaking markets may have special keys to switch between non-English typing and the Roman alphabet and vice-versa. In Japan, keyboards often can be switched between Japanese and the Roman alphabet, and the character  (the Yen currency) is used instead of ""\"". In Israel, keyboards can often be switched between Hebrew and English. In bilingual regions of Canada and in the French-speaking province of Quebec, keyboards can often be switched between an English and a French-language keyboard; while both keyboards share the same QWERTY alphabetic layout, the French-language keyboard enables the user to type accented vowels such as """" or """" with a single keystroke. Using keyboards for other languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the keys, because the standard keyboard layouts do not share even similar characters of different languages (see the example in the figure above).     [ edit ]   Key types     [ edit ]   Alphanumeric          A  Hebrew keyboard  lets the user type in both  Hebrew  and the  Latin alphabet .       Alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys are used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed at the same time as some modifier keys.   The  Space bar  is a horizontal bar in the lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses in addition to its normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.     [ edit ]   Modifiers          A  Space-cadet keyboard  has many modifier keys.       Modifier keys  are special keys that modify the normal action of another key, when the two are pressed in combination. For example, <Alt> + <F4> in Microsoft Windows will close the program in an active window. In contrast, pressing just <F4> will probably do nothing, unless assigned a specific function in a particular program. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing. The most widely-used modifier keys include the  Control key ,  Shift key  and the  Alt key . The  AltGr key  is used to access additional symbols for keys, that have three symbols printed on them. On the Macintosh and Apple keyboards, the modifier keys are the  Option key  and  Command key , respectively. On MIT computer keyboards, the  Meta key  is used as a modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a  Windows key . Compact  keyboard layouts  often use a  Fn key . "" Dead keys "" allow placement of a  diacritic  mark, such as an accent, on the following letter (e.g., the  Compose key ).   The  Enter/Return key  typically causes a command line, window form or dialog box to operate its default function, which is typically to finish an ""entry"" and begin the desired process. In word processing applications, pressing the enter key ends a paragraph and starts a new one.     [ edit ]   Navigation and typing mode   Navigation keys include a variety of keys which move the cursor to different positions on the screen.  Arrow keys  are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the ' Page Up and Page Down keys ', scroll the page up and down. The  Home  key is used to return the cursor to the beginning of the line where the cursor is located; the  End key  puts the cursor at the end of the line. The  Tab key  advances the cursor to the next tab stop.   The  Insert key  is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The  Delete key  discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position ""back"" towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The  Backspace  key deletes the preceding character.   Lock keys  lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numpad. The lock keys include  Scroll lock ,  Num lock  (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and  Caps lock .     [ edit ]   System commands   The  SysRq  /  Print screen  commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a ""panic"" button to recover from crashes. The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but nowadays it usually puts a screenshot in the  clipboard . The  Break key/Pause key  no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teletype users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection. In programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties.   The  Escape key  (often abbreviated Esc) is used to initiate an escape sequence. As most computer users no longer are concerned with the details of controlling their computer's peripherals, the task for which the escape sequences were originally designed, the escape key was appropriated by application programmers, most often to mean Stop. This use continues today in Microsoft Windows's use of escape as a shortcut in dialog boxes for No, Quit, Exit, Cancel, or Abort. A common application today of the Esc key is as a shortcut key for the Stop button in many web browsers. On machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the ""start"" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows XP and Windows Vista.   The  Menu key  or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards. It is used launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 keyboard shortcut).     [ edit ]   Miscellaneous   Many, but not all, computer keyboards have a  numeric keypad  to the right of the alphabetic keyboard. On  Japanese/Korean keyboards , there may be  Language input keys . Some keyboards have  power management keys  (e.g.,  Power key ,  Sleep key  and  Wake key ); internet keys to access a web browser or  E-mail ; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls.     [ edit ]   Technology     [ edit ]   Key switches          Keyboards on laptops such as this  Sony   VAIO  usually have a shorter travel distance for the keystroke and a reduced set of keys.       "" Dome-switch "" keyboards (sometimes incorrectly referred to as a  membrane keyboards ) are the most common type in use in the 2000s. When a key is pressed, it pushes down on a rubber dome sitting beneath the key. A  conductive  contact on the underside of the dome touches (and hence connects) a pair of conductive lines on the circuit below. This bridges the gap between them and allows  electric current  to flow (the open  circuit  is closed). A scanning signal is emitted by the chip along the pairs of lines in the  matrix circuit  which connects to all the keys. When the signal in one pair becomes different, the chip generates a ""make code"" corresponding to the key connected to that pair of lines.   Keycaps  are also required for most types of keyboards; while modern keycaps are typically surface-marked, they can also be  2-shot molded,  or engraved, or they can be made of transparent material with printed paper inserts   Keys on older IBM keyboards were made with a  ""buckling spring""  mechanism, in which a coil spring under the key buckles under pressure from the user's finger, pressing a rubber dome, whose inside is coated with conductive graphite, which connects two leads below, completing a circuit. This produces a clicking sound, and gives physical feedback for the typist indicating that the key has been depressed. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] When a key is pressed and the circuit is completed, the code generated is sent to the computer either via a keyboard cable (using on-off electrical pulses to represent  bits ) or over a  wireless  connection.   A chip inside the computer receives the signal bits and decodes them into the appropriate keypress. The computer then decides what to do on the basis of the key pressed (e.g. display a character on the screen, or perform some action). When the key is released, a break code (different from the make code) is sent to indicate the key is no longer pressed. If the break code is missed (e.g. due to a keyboard switch) it is possible for the keyboard controller to believe the key is pressed down when it is not, which is why pressing then releasing the key again will release the key (since another break code is sent). Other types of keyboards function in a similar manner, the main differences being how the individual key-switches work. For more on this subject refer to the article on  keyboard technology .   Certain key presses are special, namely  Ctrl-Alt-Delete  and  SysRq , but what makes them special is a function of software. In the PC architecture, the keyboard controller (the component in the computer that receives the make and break codes) sends the computer's CPU a hardware  interrupt  whenever a key is pressed or released. The CPU's interrupt routine which handles these interrupts usually just places the key's code in a queue, to be handled later by other code when it gets around to it, then returns to whatever the computer was doing before. The special keys cause the interrupt routine to take a different ""emergency"" exit instead. This more trusted route is much harder to intercept.   The layout of a keyboard can be changed by remapping the keys. When you remap a key, you tell the computer a new meaning for the pressing of that key. Keyboard remapping is supported at a driver-level configurable within the operating system, or as add-ons to the existing programs. For Windows, Microsoft provides a downloadable tool called  Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator , and there are several other software programs, including  SharpKeys  and  KeyTweak .     [ edit ]   Control processor   The modern PC keyboard has more than just switches. It also includes a control processor and indicator lights to provide feedback to the user about what state the keyboard is in. Depending on the sophistication of the controller's programming, the keyboard may also offer other special features. The processor is usually a single chip  8048   microcontroller  variant. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs and it processes the incoming keystrokes and sends the results down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to a receiver in the main computer box. It also controls the illumination of the "" caps lock "", "" num lock "" and "" scroll lock "" lights.   A common test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the ""caps lock"" key. The keyboard sends the key code to the  keyboard driver  running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the  shift ,  alt  and  control  state of the keyboard.   When pressing a keyboard key, the key ""bounces"" like a ball against its contacts several times before it settles into firm contact. When released, it bounces some more until it reverts to the uncontacted state. If the computer were watching for each pulse, it would see many keystrokes for what the user thought was just one. To resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard (or computer) "" debounces "" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one ""confirmed"" keystroke that (usually) corresponds to what is typically a solid contact.   Some low-quality keyboards suffer problems with  rollover  (that is, when multiple keys are pressed in quick succession); some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. This is undesirable for  games  (designed for multiple keypresses, e.g. casting a spell while holding down keys to run) and undesirable for extremely fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys). A common side effect of this shortcoming is called ""phantom key blocking"": on some keyboards, pressing three keys simultaneously sometimes resulted in a 4th keypress being registered. Modern keyboards prevent this from happening by blocking the 3rd key in certain key combinations, but while this prevents phantom input, it also means that when two keys are depressed simultaneously, many of the other keys on the keyboard will not respond until one of the two depressed keys is lifted. With better keyboards designs, this seldom happens in office programs, but it remains a problem in games even on expensive keyboards, due to wildly different and/or configurable key/command layouts in different games.     [ edit ]   Connection types   There are several ways of connecting a keyboard using cables, including the standard AT connector commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the  PS/2  and the  USB  connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary  Apple Desktop Bus  for its keyboard connector.   Wireless  keyboards have become popular for their increased user freedom. A wireless keyboard often includes a required combination transmitter and receiver unit that attaches to the computer's keyboard port (see  Connection types  above). The wireless aspect is achieved either by  radio frequency  (RF) or by  infrared  (IR) signals sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer. A wireless keyboard may use an industry standard RF, called  Bluetooth . With Bluetooth, the transceiver may be built into the computer. However, a wireless keyboard needs batteries to work and may pose a security problem due to the risk of data "" eavesdropping "" by hackers. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Alternative text-entering methods          An on-screen keyboard controlled with the mouse can be used by users with limited mobility.       Optical character recognition  (OCR) is preferable to rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a  Linotype -composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of  character  codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example,  Google Book Search ) and promises more for the future.   Speech recognition  converts speech into machine-readable text (that is, a string of character codes). The technology has already reached an impressive state and is already implemented in  various software products . For certain uses (e.g., transcription of medical or legal dictation; journalism; writing essays or novels) it is starting to replace the keyboard; however, it does not threaten to replace keyboards entirely anytime soon. It can, however, interpret commands (for example, ""close window"" or ""undo that"") in addition to text. Therefore, it has theoretical potential to replace keyboards entirely (whereas OCR replaces them only for a certain kind of task).   Pointing devices  can be used to enter text or characters in contexts where using a physical keyboard would be inappropriate or impossible. These accessories typically present characters on a display, in a layout that provides fast access to the more frequently used characters or character combinations. Popular examples of this kind of input are  Graffiti ,  Dasher  and on-screen  virtual keyboards . FITALY ( http://www.FITALY.com ) is a stylus/one-finger keyboard that can yield 50+ WPM. The key is to stare at the keyboard, not the screen (as in traditional touch typing). No memorization of layout is required. It is engineered for rapid text input (e.g., some 85% of English words are visible at the center of the keyboard). It is available for many mobile and laptop devices.     [ edit ]   Other issues     [ edit ]   Keystroke hacking   Keystroke logging  (often called keylogging) is a method of capturing and recording user keystrokes. While it is used legitimately to measure employee productivity on certain clerical tasks, or by law enforcement agencies to find out about illegal activities, it is also used by hackers for law-breaking. Hackers use keyloggers as a means to obtain passwords or encryption keys and thus bypassing other security measures.   Keystroke logging can be achieved by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computers operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.   Anti-spyware  applications are able to detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by  anti-spyware  programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a  firewall  does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured.  Network monitors  (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from ""phoning home"" with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window.  [ 5 ]   Electromagnetic waves released every time key is pressed on the keyboard can be detected by a nearby antenna and interpreted by computer software to work out exactly what was typed.  [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Physical injury          Proper ergonomic design of computer keyboard desks is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries, which can develop over time and can lead to long-term disability. [ 7 ]       The use of any keyboard may cause serious injury (that is,  carpal tunnel syndrome  or other  repetitive strain injury ) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks to get up and walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.   Some  Adaptive technology  ranging from special keyboards, mouse replacements and pen tablet interfaces to  speech recognition  software can reduce the risk of injury. Pause software reminds the user to pause frequently. Switching to a much more ergonomic keyboard layout such as  Dvorak [ citation needed ]  or  Colemak  may reduce the risk of injury. Switching to a much more ergonomic mouse, such as a vertical mouse or joystick mouse may provide relief. Switching from using a mouse to using a stylus pen with graphic tablet or a  trackpad  such as a  Smart Cat  trackpad can lessen the repetitive strain on the arms and hands.

clueweb09-enwp00-50-20602	"                     Das Keyboard          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  does not  cite  any  references or sources . Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (February 2007)       Das Keyboard  is a high-end mechanical computer  keyboard . Its most distinctive feature is that one version has no inscriptions on the keys; that is, the keys themselves are both completely  black  and blank. The name comes from the  German  word  das  ( the  in  German ) simply translated to ""The Keyboard"". Another reference to the German language is that the keyboard targets  ber - Geeks .           Contents       1   Criticism   2   History   3   See also   4   External links               [ edit ]   Criticism   The original Das Keyboard, which was made in the  Czech Republic , has received criticism from some who feel that it is essentially just an expensive version of a standard quality  dome-switch  (""membrane"") keyboard. The 'spongy' feel of the keys has also been unfavorably compared with keyboards using  mechanical  key switches; in addition, some feel the advantage of the weighted keys has been overstated. [ citation needed ]   Das Keyboard II, which sells for twenty dollars more than the original, addresses the above criticisms of the first version. It features gold-plated and clicky mechanical key switches made by  Cherry  which are similar, but not identical, to the "" buckling spring "" type key switches in the old IBM  Model M keyboard . Das Keyboard III, which was launched in July 2008 introduced two new models, the Ultimate (blank keys) and the Professional (traditional QWERTY inscriptions). The new glossy black look, blue LEDs and the addition of a USB hub make the keyboard much more up-to-date.

Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (October 2008)       The keyboard was designed by Daniel Guermeur, the founder of Metadot Corporation, an open source software company located in Austin, Texas, USA. Daniel Guermeur noticed that hunting and pecking was not very efficient for someone spending most of his days typing on a computer. He was looking for a radical solution which would prevent him from looking at the keys. Thus he had a Chinese factory make his first blank keyboard. After a few seconds of using it, the low-cost, rubber-membrane keyboard was giving atrocious tactile feedback so he decided that blank keys were not enough to type fast; the keyboard component quality was paramount as well. He then had another factory make the best quality keyboard they could deliver and added the blank keys. After few weeks of usage Daniel doubled his typing speed.   Friends and colleagues asked him many times where they could buy a blank keyboard like his, but this was a one-of-a-kind keyboard. After he noticed a wide interest in this blank typing device he decided to launch a new product line focusing exclusively on providing the best quality keyboard equipment available on the market. The first week after the launch of the first Das Keyboard, its website got several million hits and was mentioned numerous blogs and leading newspapers including Slashdot and the New York Times.

Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (October 2008)       For other uses, see  Keyboard .   In  computing , a  keyboard  is an  input device , partially modeled after the  typewriter keyboard , which uses an arrangement of buttons or  keys , which act as electronic switches. A keyboard typically has characters  engraved  or  printed  on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written  symbol . However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce  letters ,  numbers  or  signs  ( characters ), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or computer commands.   In normal usage, the keyboard is used to type text or numbers into a  word processor ,  text editor  or other program. In a modern computer, the interpretation of keypresses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all keypresses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either with regular keyboards or by using special  gaming keyboards , which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as  Windows '  Control-Alt-Delete  combination, which brings up a task window or shuts down the machine.

The internationally-common 102/105 key keyboards have a smaller 'left shift' key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Gaming and multimedia   Keyboards with extra keys, such as multimedia keyboards, have special keys for accessing music, web and other oft-used programs, a  mute  button,  volume  buttons or  knob  and standby (sleep) button.  Gaming  keyboards have extra function keys, which can be programmed with keystroke macros. For example, 'ctrl+shift+y' could be a keystroke that is frequently used in a certain computer game. Shortcuts marked on color-coded keys are used for some software applications and for specialized for uses including word processing,  video editing ,  graphic design  and  audio editing .     [ edit ]   Thumb-sized          Wireless keyboard with a  Windows  button and  multimedia  keys on the top.       Smaller keyboards have been introduced for laptops, PDAs, cellphones or users who have a limited workspace. The size of a standard keyboard is dictated by the practical consideration that the keys must be large enough to be easily pressed by fingers. To reduce the size of the keyboard, the numeric keyboard to the right of the alphabetic keyboard can be removed, or the size of the keys can be reduced, which makes it harder to enter text. Another way to reduce the size of the keyboard is to reduce the number of keys and use  chording   keyer , i.e. pressing several keys simultaneously. For example, the  GKOS keyboard  has been designed for small wireless devices. Other two-handed alternatives more akin to a  game controller , such as the  AlphaGrip , are also used as a way to input data and text. Another way to reduce the size of a keyboard is to use smaller buttons and pack them closer together. Such keyboards, often called a "" thumbboard "" (thumbing) are used in some  personal digital assistants  such as the  Palm Treo  and  BlackBerry  and some  Ultra-Mobile PCs  such as the  OQO .     [ edit ]   Numeric   Numeric keyboards contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, and several function keys (e.g. End, Delete, etc.). They are often used to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboard-equipped laptops or with smaller keyboards that do not have a numeric keypad.     [ edit ]   Non-standard or special-use types     [ edit ]   Chorded          A  foldable  keyboard.       A keyset or  chorded keyboard  is a computer input device that allows the user to enter characters or commands formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a ""chord"" on a piano. The large number of combinations available from a small number of keys allows text or commands to be entered with one hand, leaving the other hand free to do something else. A secondary advantage is that it can be built into a device (such as a pocket-sized computer) that is too small to contain a normal sized keyboard. A chorded keyboard designed to be used while held in the hand is called a keyer.     [ edit ]   Virtual   Virtual keyboards, such as the I-Tech Virtual  Laser Keyboard , project an image of a full-size keyboard onto a surface.  Sensors  in the projection unit identify which key is being ""pressed"" and relay the signals to a computer or  personal digital assistant . There is also a virtual keyboard, the On-Screen Keyboard, for use on Windows.     [ edit ]   Touchscreens   Touchscreens, such as with the  iPhone  and the  OLPC  laptop, can be used as a keyboard. (The  OLPC  initiative's second computer will be effectively two tablet touchscreens hinged together like a book. It can be used as a convertible  Tablet PC  where the keyboard is one half-screen (one side of the book) which turns into a touchscreen virtual keyboard.)     [ edit ]   Foldable   Foldable keyboards are made of soft plastic which can be rolled or folded over for travel. When in use, the keyboard can conform to uneven surfaces, and it is more resistant to liquids than a standard keyboard. Some models can be fully immersed in water, making them popular in hospitals and laboratories, as they can be disinfected.     [ edit ]   Layout     [ edit ]   Alphabetic       Main article:  Keyboard layout              The 104-key PC  US   English   QWERTY  keyboard layout evolved from the standard  typewriter  keyboard, with extra keys for computing.              The  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  layout arranges keys so that frequently used keys are easiest to press, which reduces muscle fatigue when typing common English.       There are a number of different arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different  keyboard layouts  arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, either because they are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting,  computer programming , or other purposes. Most of the more common keyboard layouts ( QWERTY -based and similar) were designed in the era of the mechanical typewriters, so their ergonomics had to be slightly compromised in order to tackle some of the mechanical limitations of the typewriter. As the letter-keys were attached to levers that needed to move freely, inventor  Christopher Sholes  developed the QWERTY layout to reduce the likelihood of jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, QWERTY layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as the  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  are not in widespread use.   The QWERTZ layout is fairly widely used in Germany and much of Central Europe. The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped, and most special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters. Another situation takes place with national layouts. Keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release the space for  ; similarly, those for French and other European languages may have a special key for the character   . The AZERTY layout is used in France, Belgium and some neighbouring countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout in that the A and Q are swapped, the Z and W are swapped, and the M is moved from the right of N to the right of L (where colon/semicolon is on a US keyboard). The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters.   Keyboards designed for non-English speaking markets may have special keys to switch between non-English typing and the Roman alphabet and vice-versa. In Japan, keyboards often can be switched between Japanese and the Roman alphabet, and the character  (the Yen currency) is used instead of ""\"". In Israel, keyboards can often be switched between Hebrew and English. In bilingual regions of Canada and in the French-speaking province of Quebec, keyboards can often be switched between an English and a French-language keyboard; while both keyboards share the same QWERTY alphabetic layout, the French-language keyboard enables the user to type accented vowels such as """" or """" with a single keystroke. Using keyboards for other languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the keys, because the standard keyboard layouts do not share even similar characters of different languages (see the example in the figure above).     [ edit ]   Key types     [ edit ]   Alphanumeric          A  Hebrew keyboard  lets the user type in both  Hebrew  and the  Latin alphabet .       Alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys are used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed at the same time as some modifier keys.   The  Space bar  is a horizontal bar in the lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses in addition to its normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.     [ edit ]   Modifiers          A  Space-cadet keyboard  has many modifier keys.       Modifier keys  are special keys that modify the normal action of another key, when the two are pressed in combination. For example, <Alt> + <F4> in Microsoft Windows will close the program in an active window. In contrast, pressing just <F4> will probably do nothing, unless assigned a specific function in a particular program. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing. The most widely-used modifier keys include the  Control key ,  Shift key  and the  Alt key . The  AltGr key  is used to access additional symbols for keys, that have three symbols printed on them. On the Macintosh and Apple keyboards, the modifier keys are the  Option key  and  Command key , respectively. On MIT computer keyboards, the  Meta key  is used as a modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a  Windows key . Compact  keyboard layouts  often use a  Fn key . "" Dead keys "" allow placement of a  diacritic  mark, such as an accent, on the following letter (e.g., the  Compose key ).   The  Enter/Return key  typically causes a command line, window form or dialog box to operate its default function, which is typically to finish an ""entry"" and begin the desired process. In word processing applications, pressing the enter key ends a paragraph and starts a new one.     [ edit ]   Navigation and typing mode   Navigation keys include a variety of keys which move the cursor to different positions on the screen.  Arrow keys  are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the ' Page Up and Page Down keys ', scroll the page up and down. The  Home  key is used to return the cursor to the beginning of the line where the cursor is located; the  End key  puts the cursor at the end of the line. The  Tab key  advances the cursor to the next tab stop.   The  Insert key  is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The  Delete key  discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position ""back"" towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The  Backspace  key deletes the preceding character.   Lock keys  lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numpad. The lock keys include  Scroll lock ,  Num lock  (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and  Caps lock .     [ edit ]   System commands   The  SysRq  /  Print screen  commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a ""panic"" button to recover from crashes. The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but nowadays it usually puts a screenshot in the  clipboard . The  Break key/Pause key  no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teletype users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection. In programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties.   The  Escape key  (often abbreviated Esc) is used to initiate an escape sequence. As most computer users no longer are concerned with the details of controlling their computer's peripherals, the task for which the escape sequences were originally designed, the escape key was appropriated by application programmers, most often to mean Stop. This use continues today in Microsoft Windows's use of escape as a shortcut in dialog boxes for No, Quit, Exit, Cancel, or Abort. A common application today of the Esc key is as a shortcut key for the Stop button in many web browsers. On machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the ""start"" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows XP and Windows Vista.   The  Menu key  or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards. It is used launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 keyboard shortcut).     [ edit ]   Miscellaneous   Many, but not all, computer keyboards have a  numeric keypad  to the right of the alphabetic keyboard. On  Japanese/Korean keyboards , there may be  Language input keys . Some keyboards have  power management keys  (e.g.,  Power key ,  Sleep key  and  Wake key ); internet keys to access a web browser or  E-mail ; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls.     [ edit ]   Technology     [ edit ]   Key switches          Keyboards on laptops such as this  Sony   VAIO  usually have a shorter travel distance for the keystroke and a reduced set of keys.       "" Dome-switch "" keyboards (sometimes incorrectly referred to as a  membrane keyboards ) are the most common type in use in the 2000s. When a key is pressed, it pushes down on a rubber dome sitting beneath the key. A  conductive  contact on the underside of the dome touches (and hence connects) a pair of conductive lines on the circuit below. This bridges the gap between them and allows  electric current  to flow (the open  circuit  is closed). A scanning signal is emitted by the chip along the pairs of lines in the  matrix circuit  which connects to all the keys. When the signal in one pair becomes different, the chip generates a ""make code"" corresponding to the key connected to that pair of lines.   Keycaps  are also required for most types of keyboards; while modern keycaps are typically surface-marked, they can also be  2-shot molded,  or engraved, or they can be made of transparent material with printed paper inserts   Keys on older IBM keyboards were made with a  ""buckling spring""  mechanism, in which a coil spring under the key buckles under pressure from the user's finger, pressing a rubber dome, whose inside is coated with conductive graphite, which connects two leads below, completing a circuit. This produces a clicking sound, and gives physical feedback for the typist indicating that the key has been depressed. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] When a key is pressed and the circuit is completed, the code generated is sent to the computer either via a keyboard cable (using on-off electrical pulses to represent  bits ) or over a  wireless  connection.   A chip inside the computer receives the signal bits and decodes them into the appropriate keypress. The computer then decides what to do on the basis of the key pressed (e.g. display a character on the screen, or perform some action). When the key is released, a break code (different from the make code) is sent to indicate the key is no longer pressed. If the break code is missed (e.g. due to a keyboard switch) it is possible for the keyboard controller to believe the key is pressed down when it is not, which is why pressing then releasing the key again will release the key (since another break code is sent). Other types of keyboards function in a similar manner, the main differences being how the individual key-switches work. For more on this subject refer to the article on  keyboard technology .   Certain key presses are special, namely  Ctrl-Alt-Delete  and  SysRq , but what makes them special is a function of software. In the PC architecture, the keyboard controller (the component in the computer that receives the make and break codes) sends the computer's CPU a hardware  interrupt  whenever a key is pressed or released. The CPU's interrupt routine which handles these interrupts usually just places the key's code in a queue, to be handled later by other code when it gets around to it, then returns to whatever the computer was doing before. The special keys cause the interrupt routine to take a different ""emergency"" exit instead. This more trusted route is much harder to intercept.   The layout of a keyboard can be changed by remapping the keys. When you remap a key, you tell the computer a new meaning for the pressing of that key. Keyboard remapping is supported at a driver-level configurable within the operating system, or as add-ons to the existing programs. For Windows, Microsoft provides a downloadable tool called  Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator , and there are several other software programs, including  SharpKeys  and  KeyTweak .     [ edit ]   Control processor   The modern PC keyboard has more than just switches. It also includes a control processor and indicator lights to provide feedback to the user about what state the keyboard is in. Depending on the sophistication of the controller's programming, the keyboard may also offer other special features. The processor is usually a single chip  8048   microcontroller  variant. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs and it processes the incoming keystrokes and sends the results down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to a receiver in the main computer box. It also controls the illumination of the "" caps lock "", "" num lock "" and "" scroll lock "" lights.   A common test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the ""caps lock"" key. The keyboard sends the key code to the  keyboard driver  running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the  shift ,  alt  and  control  state of the keyboard.   When pressing a keyboard key, the key ""bounces"" like a ball against its contacts several times before it settles into firm contact. When released, it bounces some more until it reverts to the uncontacted state. If the computer were watching for each pulse, it would see many keystrokes for what the user thought was just one. To resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard (or computer) "" debounces "" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one ""confirmed"" keystroke that (usually) corresponds to what is typically a solid contact.   Some low-quality keyboards suffer problems with  rollover  (that is, when multiple keys are pressed in quick succession); some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. This is undesirable for  games  (designed for multiple keypresses, e.g. casting a spell while holding down keys to run) and undesirable for extremely fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys). A common side effect of this shortcoming is called ""phantom key blocking"": on some keyboards, pressing three keys simultaneously sometimes resulted in a 4th keypress being registered. Modern keyboards prevent this from happening by blocking the 3rd key in certain key combinations, but while this prevents phantom input, it also means that when two keys are depressed simultaneously, many of the other keys on the keyboard will not respond until one of the two depressed keys is lifted. With better keyboards designs, this seldom happens in office programs, but it remains a problem in games even on expensive keyboards, due to wildly different and/or configurable key/command layouts in different games.     [ edit ]   Connection types   There are several ways of connecting a keyboard using cables, including the standard AT connector commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the  PS/2  and the  USB  connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary  Apple Desktop Bus  for its keyboard connector.   Wireless  keyboards have become popular for their increased user freedom. A wireless keyboard often includes a required combination transmitter and receiver unit that attaches to the computer's keyboard port (see  Connection types  above). The wireless aspect is achieved either by  radio frequency  (RF) or by  infrared  (IR) signals sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer. A wireless keyboard may use an industry standard RF, called  Bluetooth . With Bluetooth, the transceiver may be built into the computer. However, a wireless keyboard needs batteries to work and may pose a security problem due to the risk of data "" eavesdropping "" by hackers. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Alternative text-entering methods          An on-screen keyboard controlled with the mouse can be used by users with limited mobility.       Optical character recognition  (OCR) is preferable to rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a  Linotype -composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of  character  codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example,  Google Book Search ) and promises more for the future.   Speech recognition  converts speech into machine-readable text (that is, a string of character codes). The technology has already reached an impressive state and is already implemented in  various software products . For certain uses (e.g., transcription of medical or legal dictation; journalism; writing essays or novels) it is starting to replace the keyboard; however, it does not threaten to replace keyboards entirely anytime soon. It can, however, interpret commands (for example, ""close window"" or ""undo that"") in addition to text. Therefore, it has theoretical potential to replace keyboards entirely (whereas OCR replaces them only for a certain kind of task).   Pointing devices  can be used to enter text or characters in contexts where using a physical keyboard would be inappropriate or impossible. These accessories typically present characters on a display, in a layout that provides fast access to the more frequently used characters or character combinations. Popular examples of this kind of input are  Graffiti ,  Dasher  and on-screen  virtual keyboards . FITALY ( http://www.FITALY.com ) is a stylus/one-finger keyboard that can yield 50+ WPM. The key is to stare at the keyboard, not the screen (as in traditional touch typing). No memorization of layout is required. It is engineered for rapid text input (e.g., some 85% of English words are visible at the center of the keyboard). It is available for many mobile and laptop devices.     [ edit ]   Other issues     [ edit ]   Keystroke hacking   Keystroke logging  (often called keylogging) is a method of capturing and recording user keystrokes. While it is used legitimately to measure employee productivity on certain clerical tasks, or by law enforcement agencies to find out about illegal activities, it is also used by hackers for law-breaking. Hackers use keyloggers as a means to obtain passwords or encryption keys and thus bypassing other security measures.   Keystroke logging can be achieved by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computers operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.   Anti-spyware  applications are able to detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by  anti-spyware  programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a  firewall  does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured.  Network monitors  (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from ""phoning home"" with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window.  [ 5 ]   Electromagnetic waves released every time key is pressed on the keyboard can be detected by a nearby antenna and interpreted by computer software to work out exactly what was typed.  [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Physical injury          Proper ergonomic design of computer keyboard desks is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries, which can develop over time and can lead to long-term disability. [ 7 ]       The use of any keyboard may cause serious injury (that is,  carpal tunnel syndrome  or other  repetitive strain injury ) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks to get up and walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.   Some  Adaptive technology  ranging from special keyboards, mouse replacements and pen tablet interfaces to  speech recognition  software can reduce the risk of injury. Pause software reminds the user to pause frequently. Switching to a much more ergonomic keyboard layout such as  Dvorak [ citation needed ]  or  Colemak  may reduce the risk of injury. Switching to a much more ergonomic mouse, such as a vertical mouse or joystick mouse may provide relief. Switching from using a mouse to using a stylus pen with graphic tablet or a  trackpad  such as a  Smart Cat  trackpad can lessen the repetitive strain on the arms and hands.

Please help  introduce links  to this subject in articles on  topics related to it .  (October 2006)       The  DataHand  keyboard was introduced in 1995 by  DataHand Systems, Inc.  Before that it was produced by  Industrial Innovations  as early as  1992 . The keyboard consists of two completely separate ""keyboards"", one for the left hand and one for the right, that are molded to rest your hands in. This allows you to place each hand wherever it is most comfortable to you. Each finger activates five buttons, the four compass directions as well as down. The thumbs also have five buttons as well, one inside and two outside as well as up and down. The button modules in which the fingers rest are adjustable to best fit the user's hands - each side can be independently moved up and down, towards the palm or further away.          DataHand Professional II Keyboard, right side       This  ergonomic  layout allows for all typing to occur without any wrist motion, as well as without any finger extension. The keyboard layout is initially similar to a  QWERTY  keyboard, but the middle two columns of keys (i.e. H,Y,G...) have been delegated to sideways finger movements, and all of the keys outside of the main three rows are accessed through two additional modes, including a mode for mousing. There are three different modes all together: number and symbols, ten-key, and function and mouse mode. Some practice is required. However eventual typing speedups are possible. Some people say they weren't able to type as fast as they used to. Others say they regained their typing speed. Even others say they could type significantly faster.   Also of note is the button design - instead of being spring loaded, the buttons are held in place with magnets and are activated using optical sensors. This was done in order to reduce pressure required for typing.   This unconventional keyboard was seen in the  Jodie Foster   1997  movie  Contact  as the pilot's controls for the futuristic space ship. The Industrial Innovations version was featured on the television series  Mighty Morphin Power Rangers .   After the initial prototype was released in 1995, DataHand has released the  Professional  and  Professional II  with new bodies. The  Professional II  also has extended programming capabilities over the  Professional , being able to record macros of keystrokes for convenient use.   DataHand Systems, Inc. announced in early 2008 that it was ceasing to market and sell its keyboards. The company web site states that due to supplier issues, the company will not sell the DataHand keyboard ""until a new manufacturer can be identified."" However, the company plans a final, limited production run to satisfy existing customers. In January 2009, the company's website started taking orders for a ""limited number of new DataHand Pro II units"".

In  computing , a  keyboard  is an  input device , partially modeled after the  typewriter keyboard , which uses an arrangement of buttons or  keys , which act as electronic switches. A keyboard typically has characters  engraved  or  printed  on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written  symbol . However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce  letters ,  numbers  or  signs  ( characters ), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or computer commands.   In normal usage, the keyboard is used to type text or numbers into a  word processor ,  text editor  or other program. In a modern computer, the interpretation of keypresses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all keypresses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either with regular keyboards or by using special  gaming keyboards , which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as  Windows '  Control-Alt-Delete  combination, which brings up a task window or shuts down the machine.

The internationally-common 102/105 key keyboards have a smaller 'left shift' key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Gaming and multimedia   Keyboards with extra keys, such as multimedia keyboards, have special keys for accessing music, web and other oft-used programs, a  mute  button,  volume  buttons or  knob  and standby (sleep) button.  Gaming  keyboards have extra function keys, which can be programmed with keystroke macros. For example, 'ctrl+shift+y' could be a keystroke that is frequently used in a certain computer game. Shortcuts marked on color-coded keys are used for some software applications and for specialized for uses including word processing,  video editing ,  graphic design  and  audio editing .     [ edit ]   Thumb-sized          Wireless keyboard with a  Windows  button and  multimedia  keys on the top.       Smaller keyboards have been introduced for laptops, PDAs, cellphones or users who have a limited workspace. The size of a standard keyboard is dictated by the practical consideration that the keys must be large enough to be easily pressed by fingers. To reduce the size of the keyboard, the numeric keyboard to the right of the alphabetic keyboard can be removed, or the size of the keys can be reduced, which makes it harder to enter text. Another way to reduce the size of the keyboard is to reduce the number of keys and use  chording   keyer , i.e. pressing several keys simultaneously. For example, the  GKOS keyboard  has been designed for small wireless devices. Other two-handed alternatives more akin to a  game controller , such as the  AlphaGrip , are also used as a way to input data and text. Another way to reduce the size of a keyboard is to use smaller buttons and pack them closer together. Such keyboards, often called a "" thumbboard "" (thumbing) are used in some  personal digital assistants  such as the  Palm Treo  and  BlackBerry  and some  Ultra-Mobile PCs  such as the  OQO .     [ edit ]   Numeric   Numeric keyboards contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, and several function keys (e.g. End, Delete, etc.). They are often used to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboard-equipped laptops or with smaller keyboards that do not have a numeric keypad.     [ edit ]   Non-standard or special-use types     [ edit ]   Chorded          A  foldable  keyboard.       A keyset or  chorded keyboard  is a computer input device that allows the user to enter characters or commands formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a ""chord"" on a piano. The large number of combinations available from a small number of keys allows text or commands to be entered with one hand, leaving the other hand free to do something else. A secondary advantage is that it can be built into a device (such as a pocket-sized computer) that is too small to contain a normal sized keyboard. A chorded keyboard designed to be used while held in the hand is called a keyer.     [ edit ]   Virtual   Virtual keyboards, such as the I-Tech Virtual  Laser Keyboard , project an image of a full-size keyboard onto a surface.  Sensors  in the projection unit identify which key is being ""pressed"" and relay the signals to a computer or  personal digital assistant . There is also a virtual keyboard, the On-Screen Keyboard, for use on Windows.     [ edit ]   Touchscreens   Touchscreens, such as with the  iPhone  and the  OLPC  laptop, can be used as a keyboard. (The  OLPC  initiative's second computer will be effectively two tablet touchscreens hinged together like a book. It can be used as a convertible  Tablet PC  where the keyboard is one half-screen (one side of the book) which turns into a touchscreen virtual keyboard.)     [ edit ]   Foldable   Foldable keyboards are made of soft plastic which can be rolled or folded over for travel. When in use, the keyboard can conform to uneven surfaces, and it is more resistant to liquids than a standard keyboard. Some models can be fully immersed in water, making them popular in hospitals and laboratories, as they can be disinfected.     [ edit ]   Layout     [ edit ]   Alphabetic   Main article:  Keyboard layout          The 104-key PC  US   English   QWERTY  keyboard layout evolved from the standard  typewriter  keyboard, with extra keys for computing.              The  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  layout arranges keys so that frequently used keys are easiest to press, which reduces muscle fatigue when typing common English.       There are a number of different arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different  keyboard layouts  arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, either because they are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting,  computer programming , or other purposes. Most of the more common keyboard layouts ( QWERTY -based and similar) were designed in the era of the mechanical typewriters, so their ergonomics had to be slightly compromised in order to tackle some of the mechanical limitations of the typewriter. As the letter-keys were attached to levers that needed to move freely, inventor  Christopher Sholes  developed the QWERTY layout to reduce the likelihood of jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, QWERTY layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as the  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  are not in widespread use.   The QWERTZ layout is fairly widely used in Germany and much of Central Europe. The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped, and most special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters. Another situation takes place with national layouts. Keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release the space for  ; similarly, those for French and other European languages may have a special key for the character   . The AZERTY layout is used in France, Belgium and some neighbouring countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout in that the A and Q are swapped, the Z and W are swapped, and the M is moved from the right of N to the right of L (where colon/semicolon is on a US keyboard). The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters.   Keyboards designed for non-English speaking markets may have special keys to switch between non-English typing and the Roman alphabet and vice-versa. In Japan, keyboards often can be switched between Japanese and the Roman alphabet, and the character  (the Yen currency) is used instead of ""\"". In Israel, keyboards can often be switched between Hebrew and English. In bilingual regions of Canada and in the French-speaking province of Quebec, keyboards can often be switched between an English and a French-language keyboard; while both keyboards share the same QWERTY alphabetic layout, the French-language keyboard enables the user to type accented vowels such as """" or """" with a single keystroke. Using keyboards for other languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the keys, because the standard keyboard layouts do not share even similar characters of different languages (see the example in the figure above).     [ edit ]   Key types     [ edit ]   Alphanumeric          A  Hebrew keyboard  lets the user type in both  Hebrew  and the  Latin alphabet .       Alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys are used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed at the same time as some modifier keys.   The  Space bar  is a horizontal bar in the lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses in addition to its normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.     [ edit ]   Modifiers          A  Space-cadet keyboard  has many modifier keys.       Modifier keys  are special keys that modify the normal action of another key, when the two are pressed in combination. For example, <Alt> + <F4> in Microsoft Windows will close the program in an active window. In contrast, pressing just <F4> will probably do nothing, unless assigned a specific function in a particular program. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing. The most widely-used modifier keys include the  Control key ,  Shift key  and the  Alt key . The  AltGr key  is used to access additional symbols for keys, that have three symbols printed on them. On the Macintosh and Apple keyboards, the modifier keys are the  Option key  and  Command key , respectively. On MIT computer keyboards, the  Meta key  is used as a modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a  Windows key . Compact  keyboard layouts  often use a  Fn key . "" Dead keys "" allow placement of a  diacritic  mark, such as an accent, on the following letter (e.g., the  Compose key ).   The  Enter/Return key  typically causes a command line, window form or dialog box to operate its default function, which is typically to finish an ""entry"" and begin the desired process. In word processing applications, pressing the enter key ends a paragraph and starts a new one.     [ edit ]   Navigation and typing mode   Navigation keys include a variety of keys which move the cursor to different positions on the screen.  Arrow keys  are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the ' Page Up and Page Down keys ', scroll the page up and down. The  Home  key is used to return the cursor to the beginning of the line where the cursor is located; the  End key  puts the cursor at the end of the line. The  Tab key  advances the cursor to the next tab stop.   The  Insert key  is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The  Delete key  discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position ""back"" towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The  Backspace  key deletes the preceding character.   Lock keys  lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numpad. The lock keys include  Scroll lock ,  Num lock  (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and  Caps lock .     [ edit ]   System commands   The  SysRq  /  Print screen  commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a ""panic"" button to recover from crashes. The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but nowadays it usually puts a screenshot in the  clipboard . The  Break key/Pause key  no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teletype users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection. In programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties.   The  Escape key  (often abbreviated Esc) is used to initiate an escape sequence. As most computer users no longer are concerned with the details of controlling their computer's peripherals, the task for which the escape sequences were originally designed, the escape key was appropriated by application programmers, most often to mean Stop. This use continues today in Microsoft Windows's use of escape as a shortcut in dialog boxes for No, Quit, Exit, Cancel, or Abort. A common application today of the Esc key is as a shortcut key for the Stop button in many web browsers. On machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the ""start"" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows XP and Windows Vista.   The  Menu key  or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards. It is used launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 keyboard shortcut).     [ edit ]   Miscellaneous   Many, but not all, computer keyboards have a  numeric keypad  to the right of the alphabetic keyboard. On  Japanese/Korean keyboards , there may be  Language input keys . Some keyboards have  power management keys  (e.g.,  Power key ,  Sleep key  and  Wake key ); internet keys to access a web browser or  E-mail ; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls.     [ edit ]   Technology     [ edit ]   Key switches          Keyboards on laptops such as this  Sony   VAIO  usually have a shorter travel distance for the keystroke and a reduced set of keys.       "" Dome-switch "" keyboards (sometimes incorrectly referred to as a  membrane keyboards ) are the most common type in use in the 2000s. When a key is pressed, it pushes down on a rubber dome sitting beneath the key. A  conductive  contact on the underside of the dome touches (and hence connects) a pair of conductive lines on the circuit below. This bridges the gap between them and allows  electric current  to flow (the open  circuit  is closed). A scanning signal is emitted by the chip along the pairs of lines in the  matrix circuit  which connects to all the keys. When the signal in one pair becomes different, the chip generates a ""make code"" corresponding to the key connected to that pair of lines.   Keycaps  are also required for most types of keyboards; while modern keycaps are typically surface-marked, they can also be  2-shot molded,  or engraved, or they can be made of transparent material with printed paper inserts   Keys on older IBM keyboards were made with a  ""buckling spring""  mechanism, in which a coil spring under the key buckles under pressure from the user's finger, pressing a rubber dome, whose inside is coated with conductive graphite, which connects two leads below, completing a circuit. This produces a clicking sound, and gives physical feedback for the typist indicating that the key has been depressed. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] When a key is pressed and the circuit is completed, the code generated is sent to the computer either via a keyboard cable (using on-off electrical pulses to represent  bits ) or over a  wireless  connection.   A chip inside the computer receives the signal bits and decodes them into the appropriate keypress. The computer then decides what to do on the basis of the key pressed (e.g. display a character on the screen, or perform some action). When the key is released, a break code (different from the make code) is sent to indicate the key is no longer pressed. If the break code is missed (e.g. due to a keyboard switch) it is possible for the keyboard controller to believe the key is pressed down when it is not, which is why pressing then releasing the key again will release the key (since another break code is sent). Other types of keyboards function in a similar manner, the main differences being how the individual key-switches work. For more on this subject refer to the article on  keyboard technology .   Certain key presses are special, namely  Ctrl-Alt-Delete  and  SysRq , but what makes them special is a function of software. In the PC architecture, the keyboard controller (the component in the computer that receives the make and break codes) sends the computer's CPU a hardware  interrupt  whenever a key is pressed or released. The CPU's interrupt routine which handles these interrupts usually just places the key's code in a queue, to be handled later by other code when it gets around to it, then returns to whatever the computer was doing before. The special keys cause the interrupt routine to take a different ""emergency"" exit instead. This more trusted route is much harder to intercept.   The layout of a keyboard can be changed by remapping the keys. When you remap a key, you tell the computer a new meaning for the pressing of that key. Keyboard remapping is supported at a driver-level configurable within the operating system, or as add-ons to the existing programs. For Windows, Microsoft provides a downloadable tool called  Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator , and there are several other software programs, including  SharpKeys  and  KeyTweak .     [ edit ]   Control processor   The modern PC keyboard has more than just switches. It also includes a control processor and indicator lights to provide feedback to the user about what state the keyboard is in. Depending on the sophistication of the controller's programming, the keyboard may also offer other special features. The processor is usually a single chip  8048   microcontroller  variant. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs and it processes the incoming keystrokes and sends the results down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to a receiver in the main computer box. It also controls the illumination of the "" caps lock "", "" num lock "" and "" scroll lock "" lights.   A common test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the ""caps lock"" key. The keyboard sends the key code to the  keyboard driver  running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the  shift ,  alt  and  control  state of the keyboard.   When pressing a keyboard key, the key ""bounces"" like a ball against its contacts several times before it settles into firm contact. When released, it bounces some more until it reverts to the uncontacted state. If the computer were watching for each pulse, it would see many keystrokes for what the user thought was just one. To resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard (or computer) "" debounces "" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one ""confirmed"" keystroke that (usually) corresponds to what is typically a solid contact.   Some low-quality keyboards suffer problems with  rollover  (that is, when multiple keys are pressed in quick succession); some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. This is undesirable for  games  (designed for multiple keypresses, e.g. casting a spell while holding down keys to run) and undesirable for extremely fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys). A common side effect of this shortcoming is called ""phantom key blocking"": on some keyboards, pressing three keys simultaneously sometimes resulted in a 4th keypress being registered. Modern keyboards prevent this from happening by blocking the 3rd key in certain key combinations, but while this prevents phantom input, it also means that when two keys are depressed simultaneously, many of the other keys on the keyboard will not respond until one of the two depressed keys is lifted. With better keyboards designs, this seldom happens in office programs, but it remains a problem in games even on expensive keyboards, due to wildly different and/or configurable key/command layouts in different games.     [ edit ]   Connection types   There are several ways of connecting a keyboard using cables, including the standard AT connector commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the  PS/2  and the  USB  connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary  Apple Desktop Bus  for its keyboard connector.   Wireless  keyboards have become popular for their increased user freedom. A wireless keyboard often includes a required combination transmitter and receiver unit that attaches to the computer's keyboard port (see  Connection types  above). The wireless aspect is achieved either by  radio frequency  (RF) or by  infrared  (IR) signals sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer. A wireless keyboard may use an industry standard RF, called  Bluetooth . With Bluetooth, the transceiver may be built into the computer. However, a wireless keyboard needs batteries to work and may pose a security problem due to the risk of data "" eavesdropping "" by hackers. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Alternative text-entering methods          An on-screen keyboard controlled with the mouse can be used by users with limited mobility.       Optical character recognition  (OCR) is preferable to rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a  Linotype -composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of  character  codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example,  Google Book Search ) and promises more for the future.   Speech recognition  converts speech into machine-readable text (that is, a string of character codes). The technology has already reached an impressive state and is already implemented in  various software products . For certain uses (e.g., transcription of medical or legal dictation; journalism; writing essays or novels) it is starting to replace the keyboard; however, it does not threaten to replace keyboards entirely anytime soon. It can, however, interpret commands (for example, ""close window"" or ""undo that"") in addition to text. Therefore, it has theoretical potential to replace keyboards entirely (whereas OCR replaces them only for a certain kind of task).   Pointing devices  can be used to enter text or characters in contexts where using a physical keyboard would be inappropriate or impossible. These accessories typically present characters on a display, in a layout that provides fast access to the more frequently used characters or character combinations. Popular examples of this kind of input are  Graffiti ,  Dasher  and on-screen  virtual keyboards . FITALY ( http://www.FITALY.com ) is a stylus/one-finger keyboard that can yield 50+ WPM. The key is to stare at the keyboard, not the screen (as in traditional touch typing). No memorization of layout is required. It is engineered for rapid text input (e.g., some 85% of English words are visible at the center of the keyboard). It is available for many mobile and laptop devices.     [ edit ]   Other issues     [ edit ]   Keystroke hacking   Keystroke logging  (often called keylogging) is a method of capturing and recording user keystrokes. While it is used legitimately to measure employee productivity on certain clerical tasks, or by law enforcement agencies to find out about illegal activities, it is also used by hackers for law-breaking. Hackers use keyloggers as a means to obtain passwords or encryption keys and thus bypassing other security measures.   Keystroke logging can be achieved by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computers operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.   Anti-spyware  applications are able to detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by  anti-spyware  programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a  firewall  does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured.  Network monitors  (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from ""phoning home"" with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window.  [ 5 ]   Electromagnetic waves released every time key is pressed on the keyboard can be detected by a nearby antenna and interpreted by computer software to work out exactly what was typed.  [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Physical injury          Proper ergonomic design of computer keyboard desks is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries, which can develop over time and can lead to long-term disability. [ 7 ]       The use of any keyboard may cause serious injury (that is,  carpal tunnel syndrome  or other  repetitive strain injury ) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks to get up and walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.   Some  Adaptive technology  ranging from special keyboards, mouse replacements and pen tablet interfaces to  speech recognition  software can reduce the risk of injury. Pause software reminds the user to pause frequently. Switching to a much more ergonomic keyboard layout such as  Dvorak [ citation needed ]  or  Colemak  may reduce the risk of injury. Switching to a much more ergonomic mouse, such as a vertical mouse or joystick mouse may provide relief. Switching from using a mouse to using a stylus pen with graphic tablet or a  trackpad  such as a  Smart Cat  trackpad can lessen the repetitive strain on the arms and hands.

clueweb09-enwp01-00-15463	"                     Keyboard (computing)          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Keyboard key )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .

In  computing , a  keyboard  is an  input device , partially modeled after the  typewriter keyboard , which uses an arrangement of buttons or  keys , which act as electronic switches. A keyboard typically has characters  engraved  or  printed  on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written  symbol . However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce  letters ,  numbers  or  signs  ( characters ), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or computer commands.   In normal usage, the keyboard is used to type text or numbers into a  word processor ,  text editor  or other program. In a modern computer, the interpretation of keypresses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all keypresses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either with regular keyboards or by using special  gaming keyboards , which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as  Windows '  Control-Alt-Delete  combination, which brings up a task window or shuts down the machine.

The internationally-common 102/105 key keyboards have a smaller 'left shift' key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Gaming and multimedia   Keyboards with extra keys, such as multimedia keyboards, have special keys for accessing music, web and other oft-used programs, a  mute  button,  volume  buttons or  knob  and standby (sleep) button.  Gaming  keyboards have extra function keys, which can be programmed with keystroke macros. For example, 'ctrl+shift+y' could be a keystroke that is frequently used in a certain computer game. Shortcuts marked on color-coded keys are used for some software applications and for specialized for uses including word processing,  video editing ,  graphic design  and  audio editing .     [ edit ]   Thumb-sized          Wireless keyboard with a  Windows  button and  multimedia  keys on the top.       Smaller keyboards have been introduced for laptops, PDAs, cellphones or users who have a limited workspace. The size of a standard keyboard is dictated by the practical consideration that the keys must be large enough to be easily pressed by fingers. To reduce the size of the keyboard, the numeric keyboard to the right of the alphabetic keyboard can be removed, or the size of the keys can be reduced, which makes it harder to enter text. Another way to reduce the size of the keyboard is to reduce the number of keys and use  chording   keyer , i.e. pressing several keys simultaneously. For example, the  GKOS keyboard  has been designed for small wireless devices. Other two-handed alternatives more akin to a  game controller , such as the  AlphaGrip , are also used as a way to input data and text. Another way to reduce the size of a keyboard is to use smaller buttons and pack them closer together. Such keyboards, often called a "" thumbboard "" (thumbing) are used in some  personal digital assistants  such as the  Palm Treo  and  BlackBerry  and some  Ultra-Mobile PCs  such as the  OQO .     [ edit ]   Numeric   Numeric keyboards contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, and several function keys (e.g. End, Delete, etc.). They are often used to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboard-equipped laptops or with smaller keyboards that do not have a numeric keypad.     [ edit ]   Non-standard or special-use types     [ edit ]   Chorded          A  foldable  keyboard.       A keyset or  chorded keyboard  is a computer input device that allows the user to enter characters or commands formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a ""chord"" on a piano. The large number of combinations available from a small number of keys allows text or commands to be entered with one hand, leaving the other hand free to do something else. A secondary advantage is that it can be built into a device (such as a pocket-sized computer) that is too small to contain a normal sized keyboard. A chorded keyboard designed to be used while held in the hand is called a keyer.     [ edit ]   Virtual   Virtual keyboards, such as the I-Tech Virtual  Laser Keyboard , project an image of a full-size keyboard onto a surface.  Sensors  in the projection unit identify which key is being ""pressed"" and relay the signals to a computer or  personal digital assistant . There is also a virtual keyboard, the On-Screen Keyboard, for use on Windows.     [ edit ]   Touchscreens   Touchscreens, such as with the  iPhone  and the  OLPC  laptop, can be used as a keyboard. (The  OLPC  initiative's second computer will be effectively two tablet touchscreens hinged together like a book. It can be used as a convertible  Tablet PC  where the keyboard is one half-screen (one side of the book) which turns into a touchscreen virtual keyboard.)     [ edit ]   Foldable   Foldable keyboards are made of soft plastic which can be rolled or folded over for travel. When in use, the keyboard can conform to uneven surfaces, and it is more resistant to liquids than a standard keyboard. Some models can be fully immersed in water, making them popular in hospitals and laboratories, as they can be disinfected.     [ edit ]   Layout     [ edit ]   Alphabetic   Main article:  Keyboard layout          The 104-key PC  US   English   QWERTY  keyboard layout evolved from the standard  typewriter  keyboard, with extra keys for computing.              The  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  layout arranges keys so that frequently used keys are easiest to press, which reduces muscle fatigue when typing common English.       There are a number of different arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different  keyboard layouts  arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, either because they are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting,  computer programming , or other purposes. Most of the more common keyboard layouts ( QWERTY -based and similar) were designed in the era of the mechanical typewriters, so their ergonomics had to be slightly compromised in order to tackle some of the mechanical limitations of the typewriter. As the letter-keys were attached to levers that needed to move freely, inventor  Christopher Sholes  developed the QWERTY layout to reduce the likelihood of jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, QWERTY layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as the  Dvorak Simplified Keyboard  are not in widespread use.   The QWERTZ layout is fairly widely used in Germany and much of Central Europe. The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped, and most special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters. Another situation takes place with national layouts. Keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release the space for  ; similarly, those for French and other European languages may have a special key for the character   . The AZERTY layout is used in France, Belgium and some neighbouring countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout in that the A and Q are swapped, the Z and W are swapped, and the M is moved from the right of N to the right of L (where colon/semicolon is on a US keyboard). The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters.   Keyboards designed for non-English speaking markets may have special keys to switch between non-English typing and the Roman alphabet and vice-versa. In Japan, keyboards often can be switched between Japanese and the Roman alphabet, and the character  (the Yen currency) is used instead of ""\"". In Israel, keyboards can often be switched between Hebrew and English. In bilingual regions of Canada and in the French-speaking province of Quebec, keyboards can often be switched between an English and a French-language keyboard; while both keyboards share the same QWERTY alphabetic layout, the French-language keyboard enables the user to type accented vowels such as """" or """" with a single keystroke. Using keyboards for other languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the keys, because the standard keyboard layouts do not share even similar characters of different languages (see the example in the figure above).     [ edit ]   Key types     [ edit ]   Alphanumeric          A  Hebrew keyboard  lets the user type in both  Hebrew  and the  Latin alphabet .       Alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys are used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed at the same time as some modifier keys.   The  Space bar  is a horizontal bar in the lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses in addition to its normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.     [ edit ]   Modifiers          A  Space-cadet keyboard  has many modifier keys.       Modifier keys  are special keys that modify the normal action of another key, when the two are pressed in combination. For example, <Alt> + <F4> in Microsoft Windows will close the program in an active window. In contrast, pressing just <F4> will probably do nothing, unless assigned a specific function in a particular program. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing. The most widely-used modifier keys include the  Control key ,  Shift key  and the  Alt key . The  AltGr key  is used to access additional symbols for keys, that have three symbols printed on them. On the Macintosh and Apple keyboards, the modifier keys are the  Option key  and  Command key , respectively. On MIT computer keyboards, the  Meta key  is used as a modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a  Windows key . Compact  keyboard layouts  often use a  Fn key . "" Dead keys "" allow placement of a  diacritic  mark, such as an accent, on the following letter (e.g., the  Compose key ).   The  Enter/Return key  typically causes a command line, window form or dialog box to operate its default function, which is typically to finish an ""entry"" and begin the desired process. In word processing applications, pressing the enter key ends a paragraph and starts a new one.     [ edit ]   Navigation and typing mode   Navigation keys include a variety of keys which move the cursor to different positions on the screen.  Arrow keys  are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the ' Page Up and Page Down keys ', scroll the page up and down. The  Home  key is used to return the cursor to the beginning of the line where the cursor is located; the  End key  puts the cursor at the end of the line. The  Tab key  advances the cursor to the next tab stop.   The  Insert key  is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The  Delete key  discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position ""back"" towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The  Backspace  key deletes the preceding character.   Lock keys  lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numpad. The lock keys include  Scroll lock ,  Num lock  (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and  Caps lock .     [ edit ]   System commands   The  SysRq  /  Print screen  commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a ""panic"" button to recover from crashes. The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but nowadays it usually puts a screenshot in the  clipboard . The  Break key/Pause key  no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teletype users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection. In programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties.   The  Escape key  (often abbreviated Esc) is used to initiate an escape sequence. As most computer users no longer are concerned with the details of controlling their computer's peripherals, the task for which the escape sequences were originally designed, the escape key was appropriated by application programmers, most often to mean Stop. This use continues today in Microsoft Windows's use of escape as a shortcut in dialog boxes for No, Quit, Exit, Cancel, or Abort. A common application today of the Esc key is as a shortcut key for the Stop button in many web browsers. On machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the ""start"" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows XP and Windows Vista.   The  Menu key  or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards. It is used launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 keyboard shortcut).     [ edit ]   Miscellaneous   Many, but not all, computer keyboards have a  numeric keypad  to the right of the alphabetic keyboard. On  Japanese/Korean keyboards , there may be  Language input keys . Some keyboards have  power management keys  (e.g.,  Power key ,  Sleep key  and  Wake key ); internet keys to access a web browser or  E-mail ; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls.     [ edit ]   Technology     [ edit ]   Key switches          Keyboards on laptops such as this  Sony   VAIO  usually have a shorter travel distance for the keystroke and a reduced set of keys.       "" Dome-switch "" keyboards (sometimes incorrectly referred to as a  membrane keyboards ) are the most common type in use in the 2000s. When a key is pressed, it pushes down on a rubber dome sitting beneath the key. A  conductive  contact on the underside of the dome touches (and hence connects) a pair of conductive lines on the circuit below. This bridges the gap between them and allows  electric current  to flow (the open  circuit  is closed). A scanning signal is emitted by the chip along the pairs of lines in the  matrix circuit  which connects to all the keys. When the signal in one pair becomes different, the chip generates a ""make code"" corresponding to the key connected to that pair of lines.   Keycaps  are also required for most types of keyboards; while modern keycaps are typically surface-marked, they can also be  2-shot molded,  or engraved, or they can be made of transparent material with printed paper inserts   Keys on older IBM keyboards were made with a  ""buckling spring""  mechanism, in which a coil spring under the key buckles under pressure from the user's finger, pressing a rubber dome, whose inside is coated with conductive graphite, which connects two leads below, completing a circuit. This produces a clicking sound, and gives physical feedback for the typist indicating that the key has been depressed. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] When a key is pressed and the circuit is completed, the code generated is sent to the computer either via a keyboard cable (using on-off electrical pulses to represent  bits ) or over a  wireless  connection.   A chip inside the computer receives the signal bits and decodes them into the appropriate keypress. The computer then decides what to do on the basis of the key pressed (e.g. display a character on the screen, or perform some action). When the key is released, a break code (different from the make code) is sent to indicate the key is no longer pressed. If the break code is missed (e.g. due to a keyboard switch) it is possible for the keyboard controller to believe the key is pressed down when it is not, which is why pressing then releasing the key again will release the key (since another break code is sent). Other types of keyboards function in a similar manner, the main differences being how the individual key-switches work. For more on this subject refer to the article on  keyboard technology .   Certain key presses are special, namely  Ctrl-Alt-Delete  and  SysRq , but what makes them special is a function of software. In the PC architecture, the keyboard controller (the component in the computer that receives the make and break codes) sends the computer's CPU a hardware  interrupt  whenever a key is pressed or released. The CPU's interrupt routine which handles these interrupts usually just places the key's code in a queue, to be handled later by other code when it gets around to it, then returns to whatever the computer was doing before. The special keys cause the interrupt routine to take a different ""emergency"" exit instead. This more trusted route is much harder to intercept.   The layout of a keyboard can be changed by remapping the keys. When you remap a key, you tell the computer a new meaning for the pressing of that key. Keyboard remapping is supported at a driver-level configurable within the operating system, or as add-ons to the existing programs. For Windows, Microsoft provides a downloadable tool called  Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator , and there are several other software programs, including  SharpKeys  and  KeyTweak .     [ edit ]   Control processor   The modern PC keyboard has more than just switches. It also includes a control processor and indicator lights to provide feedback to the user about what state the keyboard is in. Depending on the sophistication of the controller's programming, the keyboard may also offer other special features. The processor is usually a single chip  8048   microcontroller  variant. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs and it processes the incoming keystrokes and sends the results down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to a receiver in the main computer box. It also controls the illumination of the "" caps lock "", "" num lock "" and "" scroll lock "" lights.   A common test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the ""caps lock"" key. The keyboard sends the key code to the  keyboard driver  running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the  shift ,  alt  and  control  state of the keyboard.   When pressing a keyboard key, the key ""bounces"" like a ball against its contacts several times before it settles into firm contact. When released, it bounces some more until it reverts to the uncontacted state. If the computer were watching for each pulse, it would see many keystrokes for what the user thought was just one. To resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard (or computer) "" debounces "" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one ""confirmed"" keystroke that (usually) corresponds to what is typically a solid contact.   Some low-quality keyboards suffer problems with  rollover  (that is, when multiple keys are pressed in quick succession); some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. This is undesirable for  games  (designed for multiple keypresses, e.g. casting a spell while holding down keys to run) and undesirable for extremely fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys). A common side effect of this shortcoming is called ""phantom key blocking"": on some keyboards, pressing three keys simultaneously sometimes resulted in a 4th keypress being registered. Modern keyboards prevent this from happening by blocking the 3rd key in certain key combinations, but while this prevents phantom input, it also means that when two keys are depressed simultaneously, many of the other keys on the keyboard will not respond until one of the two depressed keys is lifted. With better keyboards designs, this seldom happens in office programs, but it remains a problem in games even on expensive keyboards, due to wildly different and/or configurable key/command layouts in different games.     [ edit ]   Connection types   There are several ways of connecting a keyboard using cables, including the standard AT connector commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the  PS/2  and the  USB  connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary  Apple Desktop Bus  for its keyboard connector.   Wireless  keyboards have become popular for their increased user freedom. A wireless keyboard often includes a required combination transmitter and receiver unit that attaches to the computer's keyboard port (see  Connection types  above). The wireless aspect is achieved either by  radio frequency  (RF) or by  infrared  (IR) signals sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer. A wireless keyboard may use an industry standard RF, called  Bluetooth . With Bluetooth, the transceiver may be built into the computer. However, a wireless keyboard needs batteries to work and may pose a security problem due to the risk of data "" eavesdropping "" by hackers. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Alternative text-entering methods          An on-screen keyboard controlled with the mouse can be used by users with limited mobility.       Optical character recognition  (OCR) is preferable to rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a  Linotype -composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of  character  codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example,  Google Book Search ) and promises more for the future.   Speech recognition  converts speech into machine-readable text (that is, a string of character codes). The technology has already reached an impressive state and is already implemented in  various software products . For certain uses (e.g., transcription of medical or legal dictation; journalism; writing essays or novels) it is starting to replace the keyboard; however, it does not threaten to replace keyboards entirely anytime soon. It can, however, interpret commands (for example, ""close window"" or ""undo that"") in addition to text. Therefore, it has theoretical potential to replace keyboards entirely (whereas OCR replaces them only for a certain kind of task).   Pointing devices  can be used to enter text or characters in contexts where using a physical keyboard would be inappropriate or impossible. These accessories typically present characters on a display, in a layout that provides fast access to the more frequently used characters or character combinations. Popular examples of this kind of input are  Graffiti ,  Dasher  and on-screen  virtual keyboards . FITALY ( http://www.FITALY.com ) is a stylus/one-finger keyboard that can yield 50+ WPM. The key is to stare at the keyboard, not the screen (as in traditional touch typing). No memorization of layout is required. It is engineered for rapid text input (e.g., some 85% of English words are visible at the center of the keyboard). It is available for many mobile and laptop devices.     [ edit ]   Other issues     [ edit ]   Keystroke hacking   Keystroke logging  (often called keylogging) is a method of capturing and recording user keystrokes. While it is used legitimately to measure employee productivity on certain clerical tasks, or by law enforcement agencies to find out about illegal activities, it is also used by hackers for law-breaking. Hackers use keyloggers as a means to obtain passwords or encryption keys and thus bypassing other security measures.   Keystroke logging can be achieved by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computers operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.   Anti-spyware  applications are able to detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by  anti-spyware  programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a  firewall  does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured.  Network monitors  (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from ""phoning home"" with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window.  [ 5 ]   Electromagnetic waves released every time key is pressed on the keyboard can be detected by a nearby antenna and interpreted by computer software to work out exactly what was typed.  [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Physical injury          Proper ergonomic design of computer keyboard desks is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries, which can develop over time and can lead to long-term disability. [ 7 ]       The use of any keyboard may cause serious injury (that is,  carpal tunnel syndrome  or other  repetitive strain injury ) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks to get up and walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.   Some  Adaptive technology  ranging from special keyboards, mouse replacements and pen tablet interfaces to  speech recognition  software can reduce the risk of injury. Pause software reminds the user to pause frequently. Switching to a much more ergonomic keyboard layout such as  Dvorak [ citation needed ]  or  Colemak  may reduce the risk of injury. Switching to a much more ergonomic mouse, such as a vertical mouse or joystick mouse may provide relief. Switching from using a mouse to using a stylus pen with graphic tablet or a  trackpad  such as a  Smart Cat  trackpad can lessen the repetitive strain on the arms and hands.

Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.

(May 2008)       An  electronic musical instrument  is a  musical instrument  that produces its sounds using  electronics . In contrast, the term  electric instrument  is used to mean instruments whose sound is produced mechanically, and only amplified or altered electronically - for example an  electric guitar .   An electronic instrument may include a  user interface  for controlling its sound, often by adjusting the  pitch ,  frequency , or duration of each  note . However, it is increasingly common for the user interface and sound-generating functions to be separated into a  music controller  ( input device ) and a  music synthesizer , respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as  MIDI  or  OSC .   All electric and electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of  audio signal processing  applications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called  sound effects ; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often hazy.   French  composer  and engineer  Edgard Varse  created a variety of compositions using  electronic horns , whistles, and tape. Most notably, he wrote  Pome lectronique  for the Phillips pavilion at the  Brussels World Fair  in 1958.   Electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. The development of new electronic musical instruments, controllers, and synthesizers continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research. Specialized conferences, notably the International Conference on  New interfaces for musical expression , have organized to report cutting edge work, as well as to provide a showcase for artists who perform or create music with new electronic music instruments, controllers, and synthesizers.

In the 18th-century, a number of acoustic instruments were adapted by composers in order to exploit the novelty of electricity. Thus, in the broadest sense, the first electrified musical instrument was the  Denis d'or , dating from 1753, followed shortly by the  Clavecin lectrique  by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste de Laborde in 1761. The former instrument consisted of a keyboard instrument of over 700 strings, electrified temporarily in order to enhance the instrument's sonic qualities. The later was a keyboard instrument the plectra of which were activated by electric circuitry.   In 1878,  Thomas A. Edison  patented the phonograph, which used cylinders similar to Scott's device. Although cylinders continued in use for some time,  Emile Berliner  developed the disc phonograph in 1887. [ 1 ]   A significant invention, which was later to have a profound effect on electronic music, was  Lee DeForest 's triode  audion . This was the first thermionic valve, or  vacuum tube , invented in 1906, which led to the generation and amplification of electrical signals, radio broadcastng, and electronic computation, amongst other things.     [ edit ]   Telharmonium          Telharmonium console by  Thaddeus Cahill  1897           Main article:  Telharmonium       The Telharmonium was the first music synthesizer. In 1897  Thaddeus Cahill  patented an instrument called the Telharmonium (or Teleharmonium, also known as the Dynamaphone). Using  tonewheels  to generate musical sounds as electrical signals by  additive synthesis , it was capable of producing any combination of notes and overtones, at any dynamic level. This technology was later used to design the  Hammond organ . Between 1901 and 1910 Cahill had three progressively larger and more complex versions made, the first weighing seven tons, the last in excess of 200 tons. Portability was managed only by rail and with the use of thirty boxcars. By 1912, public interest had waned, and Cahill's enterprise was bankrupt. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Theremin       Main article:  Theremin       Another development, which aroused the interest of many composers, occurred in 1919-1920. In Leningrad, Leon Theremin (actually  Lev Termen ) built and demonstrated his Etherophone, which was later renamed the  Theremin . This led to the first compositions for electronic instruments, as opposed to noisemakers and re-purposed machines.   Composers who ultimately utilized the Theremin included  Varse in his piece  Ecuatorial  (1934)while conductor  Leopold Stokowski  experimented with its use in arrangements from the classical repertory. [ citation needed ]  In 1929,  Joseph Schillinger  composed  First Airphonic Suite for Theremin and Orchestra , premired with the  Cleveland Orchestra  with  Leon Theremin  as soloist.     [ edit ]   Ondes Martenot           Ondes Martenot  created by  Maurice Martenot , 1928           Main article:  Ondes Martenot       The 1920s have been called the apex of the Mechanical Age and the dawning of the Electrical Age. In 1922, in Paris,  Darius Milhaud  began experiments with ""vocal transformation by phonograph speed change."" [ 3 ]  These continued until 1927.   This decade brought a wealth of early electronic instrumentsalong with the Theremin, there is the presentation of the  Ondes Martenot , which was designed to reproduce the microtonal sounds found in Hindu music, and the  Trautonium . Maurice Martenot invented the Ondes Martenot in 1928, and soon demonstrated it in Paris. Composers using the instrument ultimately include  Boulez ,  Honneger ,  Jolivet ,  Koechlin ,  Messiaen ,  Milhaud ,  Tremblay , and  Varse . In 1937, Messiaen wrote  Fte des belles eaux  for 6 ondes Martenot, and wrote solo parts for it in  Trois petites Liturgies de la Prsence Divine  (194344) and the  Turangalla-Symphonie  (194648/90).     [ edit ]   Trautonium          Mixtur- Trautonium , 1928 (revised 1952)           Main article:  Trautonium       The Trautonium was invented in 1928. It was based on the  subharmonic  scale, and the resulting sounds were often used to emulate bell or gong sounds, as in the 1950s Bayreuth productions of  Parsifal . In 1942, Richard Strauss used it for the bell- and gong-part in the Dresden premire of his  Japanese Festival Music . This new class of instruments, microtonal by nature, was only adopted slowly by composers at first, but by the early 1930s there was a burst of new works incorporating these and other electronic instruments.     [ edit ]   Hammond   Recording of sounds made a leap in 1927, when American inventor  J. A. O'Neill  developed a recording device that used magnetically coated ribbon. However, this was a commercial failure. Two years later,  Laurens Hammond  established his company for the manufacture of electronic instruments. He went on to produce the  Hammond organ , which was based on the principals of the  Telharmonium , along with other developments including early reverberation units. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Synthesizers   The most commonly used electronic instruments are  synthesizers , so-called because they artificially generate sound using techniques such as  additive ,  subtractive ,  FM  and  physical modelling synthesis  to create sounds.   Dr.  Robert Moog  introduced the first practical commercial modern music  synthesizer  with his  Moog synthesizer . This instrument used a series of tone generators with keys that would adjust the tone generators' pitch. Moog resolved to design and sell  Theremins  to gain enough money to engineer this synthesizer.   The first  digital synthesizers  were academic experiments in sound synthesis using digital computers.  FM synthesis  was developed for this purpose, as a way of generating complex sounds digitally with the smallest number of computational operations per sound sample.     [ edit ]   First electronic sound synthesizer       Main article:  Magnetophon       In 1935, another significant development was made in Germany. Allgemeine Elektrizitts Gesellschaft (AEG) demonstrated the first commercially produced  magnetic tape recorder , called the "" Magnetophon "".  Audio tape , which had the advantage of being fairly light as well as having good audio fidelity, ultimately replaced the bulkier wire recorders.   According to Dictionary.com Unabridged, the term ""electronic music"" (which, as defined in 2006 includes the tape recorder as an essential element: ""electronically produced sounds recorded on tape and arranged by the composer to form a musical composition"") first came into use during the 1930s [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Clavivox   in 1956 an important technological development was the invention of the  Clavivox   synthesizer  by  Raymond Scott  with subassembly by  Robert Moog .     [ edit ]   RCA Synthesizer          The RCA Mark II           Main article:  RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer       The  RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer  was the first programmable electronic music synthesizer and the flagship piece of equipment at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. Designed by Herbert Belar and Harry Olson at RCA, it was installed at Columbia University in 1957. Consisting of a room-sized array of interconnected sound synthesis components, much of the design of the machine was contributed by Vladimir Ussachevsky and Peter Mauzey.     [ edit ]   Mini-Moog          Robert Moog           Main article:  Minimoog       In 1970,  Charles Wuorinen  composed  Time's Encomium , the first Pulitzer Prize winner for an entirely electronic composition. Also in the 1970s, the  Mini-Moog  was created.   This was a small, integrated synthesizer that made analog synthesis easily available and affordable and became the most widely used synthesizer in both popular and electronic art music. [ 6 ]         [ edit ]   Synclavier       Main article:  Synclavier       Jon Appleton (with Jones and Alonso) invented the Dartmouth Digital Synthesizer, later to become the New England Digital Copt's  Synclavier . Barry Vercoe wrote Music 11, a next-generation music synthesis program (later evolving into  csound , which is still widely used).   In 1983,  Yamaha  introduced the first stand-alone digital synthesizer, the  DX-7 . It used frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis), first experimented with by  John Chowning  at Stanford during the late sixties. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Sound sequencer   These short few months were some of the most exciting in music history and technology, and the profundity of it was recognized at the time. It seems doubtful that electroacoustic music ever received such a wide audience again, unless one includes televised concerts by latter day rock and jazz fusion groups. Others were certainly active exploring new technology also. In that same year, 1951, former  jazz  composer  Raymond Scott  invented the first  sequencer , which consisted of hundreds of switches controlling stepping relays, timing solenoids, tone circuits and 16 individual oscillators.     [ edit ]   Computer music       Main article:  computer music       An important new development was the advent of computers for the purpose of composing music, as opposed to manipulating or creating sounds.  Iannis Xenakis  began what is called ""musique stochastique,"" or "" stochastic music ,"" which is a method of composing that employs mathematical probability systems. Different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters. Xenakis used graph paper and a ruler to aid in calculating the velocity trajectories of  glissandi  for his orchestral composition  Metastasis  (195354), but later turned to the use of computers to compose pieces like  ST/4  for string quartet and  ST/48  for orchestra (both 1962).   The impact of computers continued in 1956.  Lejaren Hiller  and  Leonard Isaacson  composed  Iliac Suite  for  string quartet , the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using  algorithmic  composition. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Hardware hacking       Main article:  circuit bending       It was within this period (1966-67) that  Reed Ghazala  discovered and began to teach "" circuit bending ""the application of the creative short circuit, a process of chance short-circuiting, creating experimental electronic instruments, exploring sonic elements mainly of timbre and with less regard to pitch or rhythm, and influenced by  John Cage s  aleatoric music  concept. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   MIDI technology       Main article:  Musical Instrument Digital Interface       In 1980, a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface by which new instruments could communicate control instructions with other instruments and the prevalent microcomputer. This standard was dubbed MIDI ( Musical Instrument Digital Interface ). A paper was authored by  Dave Smith  of  Sequential Circuits  and proposed to the  Audio Engineering Society  in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.   The advent of MIDI technology allows a single keystroke, control wheel motion, pedal movement, or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and in synchrony, with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer.   MIDI instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals. Acoustic sounds became reintegrated into studios via  sampling  and sampled-ROM-based instruments.   Miller Puckette  developed graphic signal-processing software for 4X called  Max  (after  Max Mathews ) and later ported it to  Macintosh  (with  Dave Zicarelli  extending it for  Opcode   [ 10 ] ) for real-time MIDI control, bringing algorithmic composition availability to most composers with modest computer programming background.     [ edit ]   Modern electronic musical instruments   The increasing power and decreasing cost of sound-generating electronics (and especially of the personal computer), combined with the standardization of the  MIDI  and  OSC  musical performance description languages, has facilitated the separation of musical instruments into music controllers and music synthesizers.   By far the most common musical controller is the  musical keyboard . Other controllers include the  radiodrum , Akai's  EWI , the guitar-like  SynthAxe , the  BodySynth , the  Buchla Thunder , the  Continuum Fingerboard , the  Roland Octapad , and various  isomorphic keyboards  including the  Thummer .     [ edit ]   The reactable       Main article:  reactable       The reactable is a round translucent table, used in a darkened room, and appears as a  backlit  display. By placing blocks called  tangibles  on the table, and interfacing with the visual display via the tangibles or fingertips, a  virtual   modular synthesizer  is operated, creating music or sound effects.

clueweb09-enwp00-29-01458	"                     Atari 8-bit family          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Atari 130XE )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 Atari 400 (1979)       The  Atari 8-bit family  is a series of  8-bit   home computers  manufactured from 1979 to 1992. All are based on the  MOS Technology   6502   CPU  and were the first home computers designed with custom coprocessor chips, giving them ""the most powerful graphic subsystem"" of any 8 bit machine. [ 1 ]  Over the following decade several versions of the same basic design were released, including the original  Atari 400  and  800  and their successors, the  XL  and  XE  series of computers. Late models of the machine were being produced as late as 1991.

The engineering team from Atari Grass Valley Research Center (originally ""Cyan Engineering"") [ 2 ]  felt that the 2600 would have about a three year lifespan before becoming obsolete. They started ""blue sky"" designs for a new console that would be ready to replace it around 1980, three years after the 2600's introduction. What they ended up with was essentially a ""corrected"" version of the 2600, fixing its more obvious flaws. [ 3 ]  The newer design would be faster than the 2600, have better graphics, and would include much better sound hardware. Work on the chips for the new system continued throughout 1978 and primarily focused on much-improved video hardware known as the  Color Television Interface Adapter , or CTIA.   During this gestation the home computer era began in earnest in the form of the  TRS-80 ,  Commodore PET , and  Apple II family what  Byte  Magazine  would later dub the ""1977 Trinity"". [ 4 ]  Ray Kassar, the then-new CEO of Atari from  Warner Communications , wanted the new chips to be used in a home computer to challenge Apple. In order to adapt the machine to this role, it would need to support character graphics, include some form of expansion for  peripherals , and run the then-universal  BASIC programming language . The need for character graphics led to the introduction of the  ANTIC , a co-processor that ran in concert with the CTIA to provide graphics. Like the earlier TIA of the 2600, the CTIA was designed to produce sprites and nothing else. ANTIC was built to generate conventional  bitmap graphics  and characters, providing a number of different modes with varying color support and resolution. ANTIC and CTIA worked in concert to produce the complete display.   Management identified two  sweet spots  for the new computers, a low-end version known as  Candy , and a higher-end machine known as  Colleen  (named after two attractive Atari secretaries). [ 5 ]  The primary difference between the two models was marketing; Atari marketed  Colleen  as a computer, and  Candy  as a game machine (or hybrid game console). Colleen would include slots for  RAM  and  ROM , a second 8 KB cartridge slot,  monitor output  and a full keyboard, while Candy used a plastic "" membrane keyboard "" and internal slots for memory (not user upgradable).   At the time, the  Federal Communications Commission  (FCC) mandated that signal leakage in the  television  frequency range had to be extremely low. As the Atari machines had TV circuitry inside them, they were subject to this rule and needed to be heavily shielded. Both the 400 and 800 were built around very strong cast aluminum shields forming a partial  Faraday cage , with the various components screwed down onto the internal framework. This had the advantage of producing an extremely sturdy computer, although at the disadvantage of being expensive and complex. The FCC ruling also made it difficult to have any sizable holes in the case, which eliminated expansion slots or cards that communicated with the outside word via their own connectors. Instead, Atari designed the  Serial Input/Output  (SIO)  computer bus , a daisy-chainable system that allowed multiple devices to connect to the computer through a single shielded connector. Although the 800 included internal slots, they were reserved for ROM and RAM memory modules.          Atari 800       Atari had originally intended to port  Microsoft BASIC  to the machine, as had most other vendors, intending to supply it on an 8  KB [ 6 ]  ROM cartridge. However the existing 6502 version from Microsoft was 12 KB, and all of Atari's attempts to pare it down to 8 KB failed. Eventually they farmed out the work to a local consulting firm, who recommended writing their own version from scratch, which was eventually delivered as  Atari BASIC .     [ edit ]   The early machines: 400 and 800   The machines were announced in late  1978 [ 7 ]  as the  400  and  800 , although they weren't widely available until November 1979, much closer to the original design date. The names originally referred to the amount of memory, 4 KB RAM in the 400 and 8 KB in the 800. However by the time they were released the prices on RAM had started to fall, so the machines were instead both released with 8 KB. Originally the 800 was shipped with 8 KB, but as memory prices continued to fall Atari eventually supplied the machines fully expanded to 48 KB, using up all the slots. Overheating problems with the memory modules eventually led Atari to remove the modules casings, leaving them as ""bare"" boards. Later, the expansion cover was held down with screws instead of the easier to open plastic latches.   The Atari 400, despite its membrane keyboard and single internal ROM cartridge slot, outsold the more feature rich Atari 800 by some margin. [ citation needed ]  Because of this, developers were generally unwilling to use the 800-only right cartridge slot.     [ edit ]   Liz       The hardware self-test screen of later Atari 8-bit models (XL series onwards).       The 400 and 800 were complex and expensive machines to build, consisting of multiple circuit boards mostly enclosed by massive die-cast aluminum shielding. Additionally, the machine was designed to add RAM only through cards, though it soon shipped fully expanded right from the factory. At the same time the 400 didn't compete technically with some of the newer machines appearing in the early 1980s, which tended to ship with much more RAM and an upgraded keyboard.   Another major change was the introduction of the FCC ratings specifically for digital devices in homes and offices. One of the ratings, known as  Class B , mandated that the device's RF emissions were to be low enough not to interfere with other devices, such as radios and TVs. Now computers needed just enough shielding to prevent interference (both ways), not prevent  any  emissions from leaking out. This requirement enabled lighter, less expensive shielding than the previous 400 and 800 computers.   In  1982  Atari started the  Sweet 8  (or ""Liz NY"") and  Sweet 16  projects to take advantage of these changes. The result was an upgraded set of machines otherwise similar to the 400 and 800, but much easier to build and less costly to produce. Whereas the previous machines had individual circuit boards mounted inside and outside the internal shield, in the new design a single board supported all of the circuitry and the much thinner shielding was attached to it. Improvements in  chip making  allowed a number of chips in the original systems to be condensed into one. Atari also ordered a custom version of the 6502, the ""C"" model, which added a single pin that allowed four support chips to be removed. An external expansion chassis was also supported.   Like the earlier machines, the Sweet 8/16 was intended to be released in two versions as the  1000  with 16 KB and the  1000X  with 64 KB; RAM was still expensive enough to make this distinction worthwhile.     [ edit ]   1200XL          Atari 1200XL       When the machines were actually released there was only one version, the  1200XL , an odd hybrid of features from the Sweet 8/16 projects. Notable features were 64 KB of RAM, built-in self test, redesigned keyboard (featuring four function keys and a HELP key), and redesigned cable port layout. In general terms the 1200XL most closely matched the ""high end"" Sweet 16 concept.   However the 1200XL also included a number of missing or poorly implemented features. The expansion connector from the original 1000X design was left off, making the design rely entirely on SIO again. Frustrating this was the fact that the +12V pin in the SIO port was left unconnected; only +5V power was available although some devices made use of the +12V line. An improved video circuit provided more chroma for a more colorful image, but the chroma line was not connected to the monitor port, the only place that could make use of it. Even the re-arrangement of the ports made some joysticks and cartridges difficult or impossible to use. Changes made to the operating system to support the new hardware also resulted in compatibility problems with some older software that did not follow published guidelines. There was no PAL version of the 1200XL.   The 1200XL ended up with functionality similar to the existing 800, but at a hefty price point. For all of these reasons the 1200XL sold poorly. There is an often-repeated story, perhaps apocryphal, that 800 sales shot up after the release of the 1200XL, as existing owners tried to snap them up before they disappeared. [ 8 ]  Released in late 1982, the machine was discontinued in 1983.     [ edit ]   Newer XL machines   By this point in time Atari was involved in what would soon develop into a full-blown  price war  when  Jack Tramiel  of  Commodore International  was attempting to undercut his old enemy  Texas Instruments . TI had undercut Commodore's calculator business only a few years earlier, almost driving him from the market, but this time Tramiel's supply was stronger than TI's, and he could turn the tables. Although Atari had never been a deliberate target of Tramiel's wrath, they, along with the rest of the market, were dragged into ""his"" price war in order to maintain  market share .   The timing was particularly bad for Atari; the 1200XL was a flop, and the earlier machines were too expensive to produce to be able to compete at the rapidly falling price points. The solution was to replace the 1200XL with a machine that users would again trust, while at the same time lowering the production costs to the point where they could compete with Commodore.   Starting with the 1200XL design as the basis for a new line, Atari engineers were able to add a number of new IC's to take over the functions of many of those remaining in the 1200XL. While the 1200XL fit onto a single board, the new designs were even smaller, simpler, and as a result much less expensive. To reduce cost even further, manufacturing of a new series of machines was set up in the far east.          Atari 600XL              An Atari 800XL       Several versions of the new design, the  600XL ,  800XL ,  1400XL  and  1450XLD  were announced at the 1983 Summer  CES . The machines had Atari BASIC built into the  ROM  of the computer and a  Parallel Bus Interface (PBI)  at the back that allowed external expansion. The machines looked similar to the 1200XL, but were smaller back to front, the 600 being somewhat smaller than the 800 front-to-back (similar to the original Sweet 8 project). The 1400 and 1450 both added a built-in 300 baud  modem  and a  voice synthesizer , and the 1450XLD also included a built-in double-sided  floppy disk  drive in an enlarged case.   Problems with the new production lines delayed the entry of the machines onto the market. Originally intended to replace the 1200XL in mid-83, the machines did not arrive until late in 1983, and far fewer than anticipated were available during the 1983 Christmas season. Nonetheless, the 800XL was the most popular computer sold by Atari. The 1400XL and the 1450XLD had their delivery dates pushed back, first by the priority given to the 600XL/800XL, and later by the  3600 System . In the end the 1400XL was eventually canceled outright, and the 1450XLD so delayed that it would never ship.   Prototypes which never made it to market include the  1600XL ,  1650XLD , and  1850XLD . The 1600XL was to have been a dual processor model capable of running 6502 and 80186 code. This was canceled when  James J. Morgan  became CEO and wanted Atari to return to its video game roots. [ 9 ]  The 1650XLD would have been 6502-based in a 1400XLD case. The 1850XLD was to have been based on the Amiga Lorraine [ 10 ]  (later to become the Commodore Amiga). These models were canceled when Jack Tramiel took over Atari and changed the XL series development into the XE series. The new Atari scrapped plans for the Amiga-based 1850XLD system for the  Atari ST  system.   By late 1983 the price war that had started the year before was now reaching a crescendo. Although the 600/800 were well positioned in terms of price and features, their entry into the market was so delayed that Commodore dramatically outsold them over the '83 Christmas season. Combined with the simultaneous effects of the  video game crash of 1983 , Atari was soon losing millions of dollars a day. Their owners,  Warner Communications , became desperate to sell off the division.   Although Commodore emerged intact from the computer price wars, fighting inside Commodore soon led to  Jack Tramiel 's ousting. Looking to re-enter the market, he soon purchased Atari consumer division from Warner for an extremely low price.     [ edit ]   Tramiel era: XE series and XE Game System          Atari 130XE              Atari 65XE       Jack Tramiel's  Atari Corporation  produced the final machines in the 8-bit series, which were the  65XE  and  130XE  ( XE  stood for  X L- E xpanded ). They were announced in 1985, at the same time as the initial models in the  Atari ST  series, and resembled the Atari ST. Originally intended to be called the 900XLF, the 65XE was functionally equivalent to the 800XL minus the PBI connection. The 65XE (European version) and the 130XE had the Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI), a semi-compatible variant of the Parallel Bus Interface (PBI). The 130XE shipped with 128 KB of memory, accessible through bank-selection.   An additional  800XE  was available in  Europe  (mostly  Eastern Europe ), which was essentially a 65XE repackaged in order to ride on the popularity of the original 800XL in Europe. [ citation needed ]  Unfortunately, the 65XE and 800XE machines sold in Eastern Europe had a buggy GTIA chip, specifically those machines made in China in 1991.          Atari XE Game System       Finally, with the resurgence of the gaming industry brought on by  Nintendo , Atari Corp. brought out the  XE Game System (XEGS) , released in 1987. The XE Game System was sold bundled with a detachable keyboard, a joystick and a light gun ( XG-1 ), and a couple of game cartridges (Bug Hunt and Flight Simulator II). The XE Game System was essentially a repackaged 65XE, and was compatible with almost all Atari 8-bit software and hardware as a result. Bad marketing and a lack of newer releases hampered sales.   On  January 1 ,  1992 , Atari corp. officially dropped all remaining support of the 8-bit line. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Design   The Atari machines consist of a 6502 as the main processor, a combination of ANTIC and GTIA chips to provide graphics, and the POKEY chip to handle sound and serial input/output. These ""support"" chips are controlled via a series of  registers  that can be user-controlled via memory set/get instructions running on the 6502. For example, the GTIA uses a series of registers to select colors for the screen; these colors can be changed by inserting the correct values into its registers, which are mapped into ""memory"" that is visible to the 6502. Some parts of the system also use some of the machine's RAM as a buffer, notably the ANTIC's display buffer and its  Display List  (essentially a small program written in the chip's simple  machine language  that tells ANTIC how to interpret that data and turn it into a display), as well as GTIA's sprite information.     [ edit ]   ANTIC   ANTIC  is a microprocessor which processes display instructions. A complete sequence of instructions is known as a Display List. Each instruction describes how a single ""line"" on the screen is to be displayed (specifying one of several character or graphics modes available), where it is displayed, if it contains interrupts, if fine scrolling is enabled or not, and optionally where to load data from memory (text or graphics information). Since each line can be programmed individually, this feature enables the programmer to create displays comprised of mixed graphics and text, as well as different graphics modes on the screen at once. It also enables the machine to quickly ""scroll"" the screen vertically or horizontally by means of a single memory write. ANTIC reads this Display List and the display data using DMA (Direct Memory Access), then translates the result into electrical data for GTIA to process. This process is performed without any CPU intervention.   The ANTIC is primarily responsible for drawing the ""background"" of the graphics screen, as well as text. ANTIC then passes off the video data through the GTIA, which adds color and draws sprites (which Atari called ""players"" and ""missiles""). The combination leads to oddities such as the ability to invert all the text on the screen by changing a value in memory. The  character set  is easily redirected by changing an ANTIC register, allowing the user to create their own character sets with relative ease.     [ edit ]   CTIA/GTIA   The  Colleen Television Interface Adapter  (note that ""Colleen"" was sometimes replaced with ""Color"") is the graphics chip used in early Atari 400/800 home computers. It is the successor to the  TIA  chip used in the Atari 2600. According to  Joe Decuir , George McLeod designed the CTIA in 1977. The CTIA chip was replaced with the GTIA in later revisions of the 400 and 800 and all other members of the Atari 8-bit family.  GTIA , also designed by George McLeod, adds three new graphics modes that enables the display of more colors on the screen than previously available. The ""G"" in GTIA stood for ""George's."" [ 12 ]   The CTIA/GTIA receives graphics information from ANTIC and also controls  sprites  (known at the time as ""Player/Missile Graphics""), collision detection, priority control and color-luminance (brightness) control to all objects (including DMA objects from ANTIC). CTIA/GTIA output them as separate digital luminance and chrominance signals, which are mixed to form an analogue composite video signal.     [ edit ]   POKEY   The third custom support chip, named  POKEY , is responsible for reading the keyboard, generating sound and serial communications (in conjunction with the PIA). It also provides timers, a  random number generator  (for generating acoustic  noise  as well as random numbers), and  maskable interrupts . POKEY has four semi-independent audio channels, each with its own frequency, noise and volume control. Each 8-bit channel has its own audio control register which select the noise content and volume. For higher sound resolution (quality), two of the audio channels can be combined for more accurate sound (16-bit). The name POKEY comes from the words ""POtentiometer"" and ""KEYboard"", which are two of the I/O devices that POKEY interfaces with (the potentiometer is the mechanism used by the  paddle ). This chip is actually used in several Atari arcade machines of the 80s, including  Missile Command  and  Asteroids Deluxe , among others. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Computer models     400 and 800 (1979)  original machines in beige cases, 400 had  membrane keyboard , 800 had full-travel keys, two cartridge ports, monitor output, expandable memory slots (up to 48 KB). Later PAL versions had the 6502C processor.   1200XL (1982)  new aluminum and smoked plastic cases, 64 KB of RAM, only two joystick ports. Help key, four function keys. Older software, if it was written improperly, caused compatibility problems with the new OS.   600XL and 800XL (1983)  replacements for the 400, 800 and 1200XL sans function keys. 600XL had 16 KB of memory, PAL versions had a monitor port, 800XL had 64 KB and monitor output. Both had built-in BASIC and an expansion port known as the  Parallel Bus Interface (PBI) .   800XLF  800XL with Atari FREDDIE chip and BASIC rev. C. Released in Europe only.   65XE and 130XE (1985)  A repackaged 800XLF with new cases and keyboards. The 130XE came with 128 KB of RAM and a  Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI)  instead of a PBI. The U.S./Canadian version of the 65XE had no ECI or PBI.   XE Game System (1987)  a game machine in a light beige case, with a detachable full-travel but slightly ""mushy"" keyboard (Atari ST'ish)   800XE  the final machine in the series. Styling the same as 65XE and 130XE. A 130XE with 64 KB RAM. Mainly seen in Eastern Europe.       Prototypes/Vaporware (Never Officially Released)    1400XL  Similar to the 1200XL but with a PBI,  FREDDIE  chip, built-in modem and speech synthesis chip. Cancelled by Atari.   1450XLD  basically a 1400XL with built in 5 disk drive and expansion bay for a second 5 disk drive. Code named  Dynasty .

These included:-     Several dedicated cassette tape drives. All were similar, and capable of recording at 600 bit/s on a standard  audio cassette . (Unlike some computer systems, it was not possible to use a standard cassette deck with the Atari for this purpose.)   Various  5.25-inch Floppy disk drives , including single, enhanced and true double-density models.   Several  printers  of various types; dot matrix, thermal, 4-color plotter and letter-quality daisy wheel.   Modems, including one model with an acoustic coupler and other direct-connect models.   Other peripherals, including a  Centronics / RS-232  expansion system, numeric keypad, memory module, touch tablet and an 80-column display module.     Atari's peripherals used the proprietary SIO port, which allowed them to be  daisy chained  together into a single string; a method also used later in Commodore's home computers from the  VIC-20  onwards. These ""intelligent"" peripherals were more expensive than the standard IBM PC devices, which did not need the added SIO electronics.     [ edit ]   Software     [ edit ]   Operating system     [ edit ]   Built-in       The startup screen of early Atari 8-bit models when no program is loaded.           The startup screen when ATARI BASIC is selected.       The Atari 8-bit computers came with an operating system built into the  ROM . The Atari 400/800 had the following:     OS Rev. A - 10 KB ROM (3 chips) early machines.   OS Rev. B - 10 KB ROM (3 chips) bug fixes. Most common for 400/800.     The XL/XE Atari 8-bit models all had OS revisions due to added hardware features and changes. But this created compatibility issues with some of the older software. Atari responded with the Translator Disk, a floppy disk which loaded the older 400/800 Rev. B or Rev. A OS into the XL/XE computers.     OS Rev. 10 - 16 KB ROM (2 chips) for 1200XL Rev A   OS Rev. 11 - 16 KB ROM (2 chips) for 1200XL Rev B (bug fixes)   OS Rev. 1 - 16 KB ROM for 600XL   OS Rev. 2 - 16 KB ROM for 800XL   OS Rev. 3 - 16 KB ROM for 800XE/130XE   OS Rev. 4 - 32 KB ROM (16 KB OS + 8 KB BASIC + 8 KB Missile Command) for XEGS     The XL/XE models also came with built-in  Atari BASIC . Early models came with the notoriously buggy revision B. Later models used revision C.     [ edit ]   Disk Operating System       Main article:  Atari DOS       The standard Atari OS only contained very low-level routines for accessing  floppy disk  drives. An extra layer, a  disk operating system , was required to assist in organizing  file system -level disk access. This was known as  Atari DOS , and like most home computer DOSes of the era, had to be booted from floppy disk at every power-on or reset. Unlike most DOSs, Atari DOS was entirely menu driven.     DOS 1.0  - Initial DOS for Atari.   DOS 2.0S, 2.0D  - Improved over  DOS 1.0 , became the standard for the 810 disk drive.  2.0D  was for the never-released 815 drive.   DOS 3.0  - Came with 1050 drive. Used a different disk format from previous DOSes, and was incompatible with  DOS 2.0 , making it very unpopular.   DOS 2.5  - Replaced  DOS 3.0  with later 1050s. Functionally identical to  DOS 2.0S , but able to read and write  enhanced Density  disks.   DOS 4.0  - Designed for 1450XLD, cancelled, rights given back to the author.   DOS XE  - Designed for the XF551 drive.     Several  third-party replacement DOSes  were also available, sometimes quite advanced, such as  SpartaDOS X .     [ edit ]   Other software       Main article:  Atari 8-bit computer software       Amongst the many pieces of software released for the 8-bit Atari computers, a large number of programming languages were implemented, including:-     Assemblers , via the  Atari Assembler Editor ,  Atari Macro Assembler ,  MAC/65 , and several others.   BASIC ;  Atari BASIC  was the ""standard"" BASIC implementation for the 8-bit family, originally a ROM cartridge, and built-in from the 600XL/800XL onwards. Other BASICs included  Atari Microsoft BASIC ,  Turbo Basic XL ,  BASIC XL  and  Advan BASIC .   C (Programming Language) , via the  Deep Blue C  and Lightspeed C compiler.   Other languages including  LOGO  ( Atari LOGO ),  LISP  (INTER-LISP/65),  PILOT  (Atari PILOT), several versions each of  Forth  and  Pascal ,  Action!  (a high performance Atari-specific language from OSS), and  WSFN  (which stands for nothing).     More recently, cross platform development tools (most commonly run on  PCs ), have become popular for  retrocomputing  software development.     [ edit ]   Graphics capabilities   While the ANTIC and GTIA chips allowed a variety of graphics modes to be combined, and different playfield widths to be used, the Atari's Operating System provided a basic set of graphics modes. In most cases, these were exposed to Atari BASIC via the ""GRAPHICS"" command, and to some other languages, via similar system calls.     4024 text modes    1 color of text, with each character's 88 pixels the same size as those in 320192 graphics mode, with the same hue restriction. Characters with the high-bit on were represented in inverse-video.   ""Lowercase with descenders"" mode, which was not available through GRAPHICS, only as part of custom display lists. In this mode characters were 10 pixels high and occupied either the upper or lower 8 pixels of that height. This was not strictly speaking a 4024 text mode, because of the unusual height.   Colored text, where every two bits represents a colored pixel (characters were 48 pixels that were the same size as those in 160192 graphics mode). Characters with the high-bit on were displayed using a 5th color palette registered where the 4th would normally be used.   Colored text, where every four bits represents a colored pixel (characters were 28 pixels that were the same size as those in 80192 graphics mode and had the same color limitations). This mode was not directly available through GRAPHICS but required setting GTIA flags in text mode.       2024 text mode    1 color of text, with each character's 88 pixels the same size as those in 160192 graphics mode. Characters with various bits enabled or disabled (which would normally appear as 'control-characters', lower-case characters, or inverse-video) were displayed with different colored pixels.       2012 text mode    (Same as 2024 text mode, but with larger pixels and fewer rows of text)       4024 graphics mode  4 colors (2 bpp)   8048 graphics modes  Either 2 colors (1 bpp), or 4 colors (2 bpp)   16096 graphics modes  Either 2 colors, or 4 colors   160192 graphics modes  Either 2 colors, or 4 colors   320192 graphics mode  2 colors (1 bpp). The pixels were a shade of the playfield color, and could not be different hue. (In practice on NTSC models, this actually resulted in 4 possible colors on a standard TV screen: black, white, blue, and brown, the last two colors being caused by using pixels in only even or only odd columns  thus the blue and brown regions were effectively in 160192 resolution).   80192 graphics modes (GTIA chip only)    9 colors from the color palette registers   All 15 Atari hues, but only of one brightness (plus black)   All 16 Atari shades, but only of one hue         It should be noted that these were only the modes the OS setup by default. As described above, the ANTIC chip used a display list and other settings to create these modes. The actual hardware could be programmed to display up to 384 pixels wide by putting the hardware in wide or overscan mode and up to 240 pixels tall by creating a custom display list.     [ edit ]   Software-driven modes       Main article:  Software-driven graphics modes for the Atari 8-bit computers       Due to the 8-bit Ataris' flexibility, it was possible (with clever programming) to create a number of software-driven pseudo-""modes"" beyond those directly supported in hardware. These included pseudo-256-color 80192 modes and 8024 character displays.

Therefore, this article, like the Atari 8-bit user manuals of the time, uses terms later standardised by the SI. However, it should not be assumed that the standardised ""decimal"" meaning is meant; in the majority of cases the ""binary"" meaning is intended (e.g. 1 kilobyte (or KB) refers to 2 10  bytes, not 10 bytes). In fact, a large proportion of material from the time simply used ""K"" instead of ""KB"" to refer to a ""kilobyte"".   ^  Steve Fulton,  ""Atari: The Golden Years -- A History, 1978-1981"" ,  Gamasutra , 21 August 2008, pg. 4   ^   Vendel, Curt.

All are based on the  MOS Technology   6502   CPU  and were the first home computers designed with custom coprocessor chips, giving them ""the most powerful graphic subsystem"" of any 8 bit machine. [ 1 ]  Over the following decade several versions of the same basic design were released, including the original  Atari 400  and  800  and their successors, the  XL  and  XE  series of computers. Late models of the machine were being produced as late as 1991.

The engineering team from Atari Grass Valley Research Center (originally ""Cyan Engineering"") [ 2 ]  felt that the 2600 would have about a three year lifespan before becoming obsolete. They started ""blue sky"" designs for a new console that would be ready to replace it around 1980, three years after the 2600's introduction. What they ended up with was essentially a ""corrected"" version of the 2600, fixing its more obvious flaws. [ 3 ]  The newer design would be faster than the 2600, have better graphics, and would include much better sound hardware. Work on the chips for the new system continued throughout 1978 and primarily focused on much-improved video hardware known as the  Color Television Interface Adapter , or CTIA.   During this gestation the home computer era began in earnest in the form of the  TRS-80 ,  Commodore PET , and  Apple II family what  Byte  Magazine  would later dub the ""1977 Trinity"". [ 4 ]  Ray Kassar, the then-new CEO of Atari from  Warner Communications , wanted the new chips to be used in a home computer to challenge Apple. In order to adapt the machine to this role, it would need to support character graphics, include some form of expansion for  peripherals , and run the then-universal  BASIC programming language . The need for character graphics led to the introduction of the  ANTIC , a co-processor that ran in concert with the CTIA to provide graphics. Like the earlier TIA of the 2600, the CTIA was designed to produce sprites and nothing else. ANTIC was built to generate conventional  bitmap graphics  and characters, providing a number of different modes with varying color support and resolution. ANTIC and CTIA worked in concert to produce the complete display.   Management identified two  sweet spots  for the new computers, a low-end version known as  Candy , and a higher-end machine known as  Colleen  (named after two attractive Atari secretaries). [ 5 ]  The primary difference between the two models was marketing; Atari marketed  Colleen  as a computer, and  Candy  as a game machine (or hybrid game console). Colleen would include slots for  RAM  and  ROM , a second 8 KB cartridge slot,  monitor output  and a full keyboard, while Candy used a plastic "" membrane keyboard "" and internal slots for memory (not user upgradable).   At the time, the  Federal Communications Commission  (FCC) mandated that signal leakage in the  television  frequency range had to be extremely low. As the Atari machines had TV circuitry inside them, they were subject to this rule and needed to be heavily shielded. Both the 400 and 800 were built around very strong cast aluminum shields forming a partial  Faraday cage , with the various components screwed down onto the internal framework. This had the advantage of producing an extremely sturdy computer, although at the disadvantage of being expensive and complex. The FCC ruling also made it difficult to have any sizable holes in the case, which eliminated expansion slots or cards that communicated with the outside word via their own connectors. Instead, Atari designed the  Serial Input/Output  (SIO)  computer bus , a daisy-chainable system that allowed multiple devices to connect to the computer through a single shielded connector. Although the 800 included internal slots, they were reserved for ROM and RAM memory modules.          Atari 800       Atari had originally intended to port  Microsoft BASIC  to the machine, as had most other vendors, intending to supply it on an 8  KB [ 6 ]  ROM cartridge. However the existing 6502 version from Microsoft was 12 KB, and all of Atari's attempts to pare it down to 8 KB failed. Eventually they farmed out the work to a local consulting firm, who recommended writing their own version from scratch, which was eventually delivered as  Atari BASIC .     [ edit ]   The early machines: 400 and 800   The machines were announced in late  1978 [ 7 ]  as the  400  and  800 , although they weren't widely available until November 1979, much closer to the original design date. The names originally referred to the amount of memory, 4 KB RAM in the 400 and 8 KB in the 800. However by the time they were released the prices on RAM had started to fall, so the machines were instead both released with 8 KB. Originally the 800 was shipped with 8 KB, but as memory prices continued to fall Atari eventually supplied the machines fully expanded to 48 KB, using up all the slots. Overheating problems with the memory modules eventually led Atari to remove the modules casings, leaving them as ""bare"" boards. Later, the expansion cover was held down with screws instead of the easier to open plastic latches.   The Atari 400, despite its membrane keyboard and single internal ROM cartridge slot, outsold the more feature rich Atari 800 by some margin. [ citation needed ]  Because of this, developers were generally unwilling to use the 800-only right cartridge slot.     [ edit ]   Liz       The hardware self-test screen of later Atari 8-bit models (XL series onwards).       The 400 and 800 were complex and expensive machines to build, consisting of multiple circuit boards mostly enclosed by massive die-cast aluminum shielding. Additionally, the machine was designed to add RAM only through cards, though it soon shipped fully expanded right from the factory. At the same time the 400 didn't compete technically with some of the newer machines appearing in the early 1980s, which tended to ship with much more RAM and an upgraded keyboard.   Another major change was the introduction of the FCC ratings specifically for digital devices in homes and offices. One of the ratings, known as  Class B , mandated that the device's RF emissions were to be low enough not to interfere with other devices, such as radios and TVs. Now computers needed just enough shielding to prevent interference (both ways), not prevent  any  emissions from leaking out. This requirement enabled lighter, less expensive shielding than the previous 400 and 800 computers.   In  1982  Atari started the  Sweet 8  (or ""Liz NY"") and  Sweet 16  projects to take advantage of these changes. The result was an upgraded set of machines otherwise similar to the 400 and 800, but much easier to build and less costly to produce. Whereas the previous machines had individual circuit boards mounted inside and outside the internal shield, in the new design a single board supported all of the circuitry and the much thinner shielding was attached to it. Improvements in  chip making  allowed a number of chips in the original systems to be condensed into one. Atari also ordered a custom version of the 6502, the ""C"" model, which added a single pin that allowed four support chips to be removed. An external expansion chassis was also supported.   Like the earlier machines, the Sweet 8/16 was intended to be released in two versions as the  1000  with 16 KB and the  1000X  with 64 KB; RAM was still expensive enough to make this distinction worthwhile.     [ edit ]   1200XL          Atari 1200XL       When the machines were actually released there was only one version, the  1200XL , an odd hybrid of features from the Sweet 8/16 projects. Notable features were 64 KB of RAM, built-in self test, redesigned keyboard (featuring four function keys and a HELP key), and redesigned cable port layout. In general terms the 1200XL most closely matched the ""high end"" Sweet 16 concept.   However the 1200XL also included a number of missing or poorly implemented features. The expansion connector from the original 1000X design was left off, making the design rely entirely on SIO again. Frustrating this was the fact that the +12V pin in the SIO port was left unconnected; only +5V power was available although some devices made use of the +12V line. An improved video circuit provided more chroma for a more colorful image, but the chroma line was not connected to the monitor port, the only place that could make use of it. Even the re-arrangement of the ports made some joysticks and cartridges difficult or impossible to use. Changes made to the operating system to support the new hardware also resulted in compatibility problems with some older software that did not follow published guidelines. There was no PAL version of the 1200XL.   The 1200XL ended up with functionality similar to the existing 800, but at a hefty price point. For all of these reasons the 1200XL sold poorly. There is an often-repeated story, perhaps apocryphal, that 800 sales shot up after the release of the 1200XL, as existing owners tried to snap them up before they disappeared. [ 8 ]  Released in late 1982, the machine was discontinued in 1983.     [ edit ]   Newer XL machines   By this point in time Atari was involved in what would soon develop into a full-blown  price war  when  Jack Tramiel  of  Commodore International  was attempting to undercut his old enemy  Texas Instruments . TI had undercut Commodore's calculator business only a few years earlier, almost driving him from the market, but this time Tramiel's supply was stronger than TI's, and he could turn the tables. Although Atari had never been a deliberate target of Tramiel's wrath, they, along with the rest of the market, were dragged into ""his"" price war in order to maintain  market share .   The timing was particularly bad for Atari; the 1200XL was a flop, and the earlier machines were too expensive to produce to be able to compete at the rapidly falling price points. The solution was to replace the 1200XL with a machine that users would again trust, while at the same time lowering the production costs to the point where they could compete with Commodore.   Starting with the 1200XL design as the basis for a new line, Atari engineers were able to add a number of new IC's to take over the functions of many of those remaining in the 1200XL. While the 1200XL fit onto a single board, the new designs were even smaller, simpler, and as a result much less expensive. To reduce cost even further, manufacturing of a new series of machines was set up in the far east.          Atari 600XL              An Atari 800XL       Several versions of the new design, the  600XL ,  800XL ,  1400XL  and  1450XLD  were announced at the 1983 Summer  CES . The machines had Atari BASIC built into the  ROM  of the computer and a  Parallel Bus Interface (PBI)  at the back that allowed external expansion. The machines looked similar to the 1200XL, but were smaller back to front, the 600 being somewhat smaller than the 800 front-to-back (similar to the original Sweet 8 project). The 1400 and 1450 both added a built-in 300 baud  modem  and a  voice synthesizer , and the 1450XLD also included a built-in double-sided  floppy disk  drive in an enlarged case.   Problems with the new production lines delayed the entry of the machines onto the market. Originally intended to replace the 1200XL in mid-83, the machines did not arrive until late in 1983, and far fewer than anticipated were available during the 1983 Christmas season. Nonetheless, the 800XL was the most popular computer sold by Atari. The 1400XL and the 1450XLD had their delivery dates pushed back, first by the priority given to the 600XL/800XL, and later by the  3600 System . In the end the 1400XL was eventually canceled outright, and the 1450XLD so delayed that it would never ship.   Prototypes which never made it to market include the  1600XL ,  1650XLD , and  1850XLD . The 1600XL was to have been a dual processor model capable of running 6502 and 80186 code. This was canceled when  James J. Morgan  became CEO and wanted Atari to return to its video game roots. [ 9 ]  The 1650XLD would have been 6502-based in a 1400XLD case. The 1850XLD was to have been based on the Amiga Lorraine [ 10 ]  (later to become the Commodore Amiga). These models were canceled when Jack Tramiel took over Atari and changed the XL series development into the XE series. The new Atari scrapped plans for the Amiga-based 1850XLD system for the  Atari ST  system.   By late 1983 the price war that had started the year before was now reaching a crescendo. Although the 600/800 were well positioned in terms of price and features, their entry into the market was so delayed that Commodore dramatically outsold them over the '83 Christmas season. Combined with the simultaneous effects of the  video game crash of 1983 , Atari was soon losing millions of dollars a day. Their owners,  Warner Communications , became desperate to sell off the division.   Although Commodore emerged intact from the computer price wars, fighting inside Commodore soon led to  Jack Tramiel 's ousting. Looking to re-enter the market, he soon purchased Atari consumer division from Warner for an extremely low price.     [ edit ]   Tramiel era: XE series and XE Game System          Atari 130XE              Atari 65XE       Jack Tramiel's  Atari Corporation  produced the final machines in the 8-bit series, which were the  65XE  and  130XE  ( XE  stood for  X L- E xpanded ). They were announced in 1985, at the same time as the initial models in the  Atari ST  series, and resembled the Atari ST. Originally intended to be called the 900XLF, the 65XE was functionally equivalent to the 800XL minus the PBI connection. The 65XE (European version) and the 130XE had the Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI), a semi-compatible variant of the Parallel Bus Interface (PBI). The 130XE shipped with 128 KB of memory, accessible through bank-selection.   An additional  800XE  was available in  Europe  (mostly  Eastern Europe ), which was essentially a 65XE repackaged in order to ride on the popularity of the original 800XL in Europe. [ citation needed ]  Unfortunately, the 65XE and 800XE machines sold in Eastern Europe had a buggy GTIA chip, specifically those machines made in China in 1991.          Atari XE Game System       Finally, with the resurgence of the gaming industry brought on by  Nintendo , Atari Corp. brought out the  XE Game System (XEGS) , released in 1987. The XE Game System was sold bundled with a detachable keyboard, a joystick and a light gun ( XG-1 ), and a couple of game cartridges (Bug Hunt and Flight Simulator II). The XE Game System was essentially a repackaged 65XE, and was compatible with almost all Atari 8-bit software and hardware as a result. Bad marketing and a lack of newer releases hampered sales.   On  January 1 ,  1992 , Atari corp. officially dropped all remaining support of the 8-bit line. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Design   The Atari machines consist of a 6502 as the main processor, a combination of ANTIC and GTIA chips to provide graphics, and the POKEY chip to handle sound and serial input/output. These ""support"" chips are controlled via a series of  registers  that can be user-controlled via memory set/get instructions running on the 6502. For example, the GTIA uses a series of registers to select colors for the screen; these colors can be changed by inserting the correct values into its registers, which are mapped into ""memory"" that is visible to the 6502. Some parts of the system also use some of the machine's RAM as a buffer, notably the ANTIC's display buffer and its  Display List  (essentially a small program written in the chip's simple  machine language  that tells ANTIC how to interpret that data and turn it into a display), as well as GTIA's sprite information.     [ edit ]   ANTIC   ANTIC  is a microprocessor which processes display instructions. A complete sequence of instructions is known as a Display List. Each instruction describes how a single ""line"" on the screen is to be displayed (specifying one of several character or graphics modes available), where it is displayed, if it contains interrupts, if fine scrolling is enabled or not, and optionally where to load data from memory (text or graphics information). Since each line can be programmed individually, this feature enables the programmer to create displays comprised of mixed graphics and text, as well as different graphics modes on the screen at once. It also enables the machine to quickly ""scroll"" the screen vertically or horizontally by means of a single memory write. ANTIC reads this Display List and the display data using DMA (Direct Memory Access), then translates the result into electrical data for GTIA to process. This process is performed without any CPU intervention.   The ANTIC is primarily responsible for drawing the ""background"" of the graphics screen, as well as text. ANTIC then passes off the video data through the GTIA, which adds color and draws sprites (which Atari called ""players"" and ""missiles""). The combination leads to oddities such as the ability to invert all the text on the screen by changing a value in memory. The  character set  is easily redirected by changing an ANTIC register, allowing the user to create their own character sets with relative ease.     [ edit ]   CTIA/GTIA   The  Colleen Television Interface Adapter  (note that ""Colleen"" was sometimes replaced with ""Color"") is the graphics chip used in early Atari 400/800 home computers. It is the successor to the  TIA  chip used in the Atari 2600. According to  Joe Decuir , George McLeod designed the CTIA in 1977. The CTIA chip was replaced with the GTIA in later revisions of the 400 and 800 and all other members of the Atari 8-bit family.  GTIA , also designed by George McLeod, adds three new graphics modes that enables the display of more colors on the screen than previously available. The ""G"" in GTIA stood for ""George's."" [ 12 ]   The CTIA/GTIA receives graphics information from ANTIC and also controls  sprites  (known at the time as ""Player/Missile Graphics""), collision detection, priority control and color-luminance (brightness) control to all objects (including DMA objects from ANTIC). CTIA/GTIA output them as separate digital luminance and chrominance signals, which are mixed to form an analogue composite video signal.     [ edit ]   POKEY   The third custom support chip, named  POKEY , is responsible for reading the keyboard, generating sound and serial communications (in conjunction with the PIA). It also provides timers, a  random number generator  (for generating acoustic  noise  as well as random numbers), and  maskable interrupts . POKEY has four semi-independent audio channels, each with its own frequency, noise and volume control. Each 8-bit channel has its own audio control register which select the noise content and volume. For higher sound resolution (quality), two of the audio channels can be combined for more accurate sound (16-bit). The name POKEY comes from the words ""POtentiometer"" and ""KEYboard"", which are two of the I/O devices that POKEY interfaces with (the potentiometer is the mechanism used by the  paddle ). This chip is actually used in several Atari arcade machines of the 80s, including  Missile Command  and  Asteroids Deluxe , among others.

These included:-     Several dedicated cassette tape drives. All were similar, and capable of recording at 600 bit/s on a standard  audio cassette . (Unlike some computer systems, it was not possible to use a standard cassette deck with the Atari for this purpose.)   Various  5.25-inch Floppy disk drives , including single, enhanced and true double-density models.   Several  printers  of various types; dot matrix, thermal, 4-color plotter and letter-quality daisy wheel.   Modems, including one model with an acoustic coupler and other direct-connect models.   Other peripherals, including a  Centronics / RS-232  expansion system, numeric keypad, memory module, touch tablet and an 80-column display module.     Atari's peripherals used the proprietary SIO port, which allowed them to be  daisy chained  together into a single string; a method also used later in Commodore's home computers from the  VIC-20  onwards. These ""intelligent"" peripherals were more expensive than the standard IBM PC devices, which did not need the added SIO electronics.     [ edit ]   Software     [ edit ]   Operating system     [ edit ]   Built-in       The startup screen of early Atari 8-bit models when no program is loaded.           The startup screen when ATARI BASIC is selected.       The Atari 8-bit computers came with an operating system built into the  ROM . The Atari 400/800 had the following:     OS Rev. A - 10 KB ROM (3 chips) early machines.   OS Rev. B - 10 KB ROM (3 chips) bug fixes. Most common for 400/800.     The XL/XE Atari 8-bit models all had OS revisions due to added hardware features and changes. But this created compatibility issues with some of the older software. Atari responded with the Translator Disk, a floppy disk which loaded the older 400/800 Rev. B or Rev. A OS into the XL/XE computers.     OS Rev. 10 - 16 KB ROM (2 chips) for 1200XL Rev A   OS Rev. 11 - 16 KB ROM (2 chips) for 1200XL Rev B (bug fixes)   OS Rev. 1 - 16 KB ROM for 600XL   OS Rev. 2 - 16 KB ROM for 800XL   OS Rev. 3 - 16 KB ROM for 800XE/130XE   OS Rev. 4 - 32 KB ROM (16 KB OS + 8 KB BASIC + 8 KB Missile Command) for XEGS     The XL/XE models also came with built-in  Atari BASIC . Early models came with the notoriously buggy revision B. Later models used revision C.     [ edit ]   Disk Operating System       Main article:  Atari DOS       The standard Atari OS only contained very low-level routines for accessing  floppy disk  drives. An extra layer, a  disk operating system , was required to assist in organizing  file system -level disk access. This was known as  Atari DOS , and like most home computer DOSes of the era, had to be booted from floppy disk at every power-on or reset. Unlike most DOSs, Atari DOS was entirely menu driven.     DOS 1.0  - Initial DOS for Atari.   DOS 2.0S, 2.0D  - Improved over  DOS 1.0 , became the standard for the 810 disk drive.  2.0D  was for the never-released 815 drive.   DOS 3.0  - Came with 1050 drive. Used a different disk format from previous DOSes, and was incompatible with  DOS 2.0 , making it very unpopular.   DOS 2.5  - Replaced  DOS 3.0  with later 1050s. Functionally identical to  DOS 2.0S , but able to read and write  enhanced Density  disks.   DOS 4.0  - Designed for 1450XLD, cancelled, rights given back to the author.   DOS XE  - Designed for the XF551 drive.     Several  third-party replacement DOSes  were also available, sometimes quite advanced, such as  SpartaDOS X .     [ edit ]   Other software       Main article:  Atari 8-bit computer software       Amongst the many pieces of software released for the 8-bit Atari computers, a large number of programming languages were implemented, including:-     Assemblers , via the  Atari Assembler Editor ,  Atari Macro Assembler ,  MAC/65 , and several others.   BASIC ;  Atari BASIC  was the ""standard"" BASIC implementation for the 8-bit family, originally a ROM cartridge, and built-in from the 600XL/800XL onwards. Other BASICs included  Atari Microsoft BASIC ,  Turbo Basic XL ,  BASIC XL  and  Advan BASIC .   C (Programming Language) , via the  Deep Blue C  and Lightspeed C compiler.   Other languages including  LOGO  ( Atari LOGO ),  LISP  (INTER-LISP/65),  PILOT  (Atari PILOT), several versions each of  Forth  and  Pascal ,  Action!  (a high performance Atari-specific language from OSS), and  WSFN  (which stands for nothing).     More recently, cross platform development tools (most commonly run on  PCs ), have become popular for  retrocomputing  software development.     [ edit ]   Graphics capabilities   While the ANTIC and GTIA chips allowed a variety of graphics modes to be combined, and different playfield widths to be used, the Atari's Operating System provided a basic set of graphics modes. In most cases, these were exposed to Atari BASIC via the ""GRAPHICS"" command, and to some other languages, via similar system calls.     4024 text modes    1 color of text, with each character's 88 pixels the same size as those in 320192 graphics mode, with the same hue restriction. Characters with the high-bit on were represented in inverse-video.   ""Lowercase with descenders"" mode, which was not available through GRAPHICS, only as part of custom display lists. In this mode characters were 10 pixels high and occupied either the upper or lower 8 pixels of that height. This was not strictly speaking a 4024 text mode, because of the unusual height.   Colored text, where every two bits represents a colored pixel (characters were 48 pixels that were the same size as those in 160192 graphics mode). Characters with the high-bit on were displayed using a 5th color palette registered where the 4th would normally be used.   Colored text, where every four bits represents a colored pixel (characters were 28 pixels that were the same size as those in 80192 graphics mode and had the same color limitations). This mode was not directly available through GRAPHICS but required setting GTIA flags in text mode.       2024 text mode    1 color of text, with each character's 88 pixels the same size as those in 160192 graphics mode. Characters with various bits enabled or disabled (which would normally appear as 'control-characters', lower-case characters, or inverse-video) were displayed with different colored pixels.       2012 text mode    (Same as 2024 text mode, but with larger pixels and fewer rows of text)       4024 graphics mode  4 colors (2 bpp)   8048 graphics modes  Either 2 colors (1 bpp), or 4 colors (2 bpp)   16096 graphics modes  Either 2 colors, or 4 colors   160192 graphics modes  Either 2 colors, or 4 colors   320192 graphics mode  2 colors (1 bpp). The pixels were a shade of the playfield color, and could not be different hue. (In practice on NTSC models, this actually resulted in 4 possible colors on a standard TV screen: black, white, blue, and brown, the last two colors being caused by using pixels in only even or only odd columns  thus the blue and brown regions were effectively in 160192 resolution).   80192 graphics modes (GTIA chip only)    9 colors from the color palette registers   All 15 Atari hues, but only of one brightness (plus black)   All 16 Atari shades, but only of one hue         It should be noted that these were only the modes the OS setup by default. As described above, the ANTIC chip used a display list and other settings to create these modes. The actual hardware could be programmed to display up to 384 pixels wide by putting the hardware in wide or overscan mode and up to 240 pixels tall by creating a custom display list.     [ edit ]   Software-driven modes       Main article:  Software-driven graphics modes for the Atari 8-bit computers       Due to the 8-bit Ataris' flexibility, it was possible (with clever programming) to create a number of software-driven pseudo-""modes"" beyond those directly supported in hardware. These included pseudo-256-color 80192 modes and 8024 character displays.

Retrieved on 10 June 2008 .     ^   Atari: The Golden Years   ^  It should be noted that the Atari 8-bit family predates the use of separate (and SI standarised) ""binary"" and ""decimal"" prefixes, where, for example ""kibibyte""/KiB equals 2 10  bytes as opposed to a decimal ""kilobyte""/KB equalling 10 bytes). Therefore, this article, like the Atari 8-bit user manuals of the time, uses terms later standardised by the SI. However, it should not be assumed that the standardised ""decimal"" meaning is meant; in the majority of cases the ""binary"" meaning is intended (e.g. 1 kilobyte (or KB) refers to 2 10  bytes, not 10 bytes). In fact, a large proportion of material from the time simply used ""K"" instead of ""KB"" to refer to a ""kilobyte"".   ^  Steve Fulton,  ""Atari: The Golden Years -- A History, 1978-1981"" ,  Gamasutra , 21 August 2008, pg. 4   ^   Vendel, Curt.
