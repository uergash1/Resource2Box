Orphaned by an outbreak of  cholera , she is sent back to England to the legal guardianship of her only remaining relative: her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a reclusive widower.   Craven still mourns the death of his wife, Lilias, from ten years ago. To escape his sad memories, he constantly travels abroad, leaving Mary and the  manor  under the supervision of his  housekeeper , Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   Mary finds the key to the secret garden and a  robin  shows her where the door is hidden beneath overgrown ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle briefly meets with her for the first time since her arrival, Mary asks him for permission to claim her own garden from any abandoned part of the grounds, and he acquiesces. Thanks to her new-found interests and activities, Mary herself begins to blossom, losing her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   On several occasions, Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive. They tell her that she is hearing things, or they blame the sound on ordinary sources such as the wind, or a servant with a toothache. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and both he and Colin are morbidly convinced that the boy will develop the same condition. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums.   Colin accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often, but as spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous that Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon. One day, Colin threatens to ban Dickon from the grounds, but Mary matches his bad temper and storms out without an apology. That evening, Colin escalates into a  hysterical  tantrum, convinced that he is becoming hunchbacked and is going to die; Mary shocks him out of his hysteria by screaming back at him. She also demands to see his back, and points out that the lumps behind his neck are simply the outlines of normal  vertebrae  like her own. Reassured, Colin agrees to let her bring Dickon to visit him inside his room, and they become friends.   They bring Colin outside in a wheelchair so he can see his mother's garden. Delighted, he visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows, ordering everyone else to stay away on those occasions. Despite these orders, the children are discovered by the old gardener Ben Weatherstaff, who tried to maintain the roses after Lilias' death by surreptitiously scaling the wall once or twice a year. Ben is angry with them at first, but agrees to share and keep their secret.   As the garden revives and flourishes, so does Colin. He resolves to walk and run like a normal boy by the next time his father returns home; to accomplish these aims, he carries out a program of simple physical exercises and positive thinking. He makes great progress, but they conceal it from the rest of the household with the pretense that he is still an invalid.   Mr. Craven is traveling through Europe, but is inspired to rush home after hearing the voice of his dead wife in a dream and receiving a letter from Mrs. Sowerby (Martha's and Dickon's mother, who also knows the secret) telling him, ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here."" He arrives while the children are outdoors and finds himself drawn toward the secret garden. As he approaches nearer, he is astonished to hear their voices inside the walls; Colin bursts out of the garden door toward him, actually winning a footrace against Mary and Dickon. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. When they return to the house, the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.     [ edit ]   Major themes   The author, Frances Hodgson Burnett, was a practitioner of  Christian Science  due to the premature death of her son as well as personal illness. [ 2 ]  As a result,  The Secret Garden  espouses the concepts of  New Thought  and  theosophy  as well as ideas about the healing powers of the mind. [ 3 ]   The garden is the book's central symbol. The secret garden at Misselthwaite Manor is the site of both the near-destruction and the subsequent regeneration of a family. [ 4 ]  Using the garden motif, Burnett explores the healing power inherent in living things.   Maytham Hall in  Kent, England , where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage to Stephen Townesend, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.  [ 5 ]  Burnett kept an extensive garden, including an impressive rose garden. However, it has been noted that besides the garden, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Publication history   The Secret Garden  was first serialized, starting in autumn 1910, in  The American Magazine , a publication aimed at adults. The entire book was first published in summer 1911 by Frederick A. Stokes in New York and by  Heinemann  in London. Its  copyright  expired in the US in 1987 and in most other parts of the world in 1995, placing the book in the  public domain .     [ edit ]   Public reception   Marketing to both adult and juvenile audiences may have had an effect on its early reception; the book was not as celebrated as Burnett's previous works during her lifetime.  [ 7 ]   The Secret Garden  paled in comparison to the popularity of Burnett's other works for a long period. Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Anne H. Lundin noted [ 8 ]  that the author's obituary notices all remarked on  Little Lord Fauntleroy  and passed over  The Secret Garden  in silence.   With the rise of scholarly work in children's literature over the past quarter-century,  The Secret Garden  has steadily risen to prominence, and is now arguably Burnett's best-known work. The book is often noted as one of the best children's books of the twentieth century  [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Dramatic adaptations   The Secret Garden  has been adapted many times for other media. The following list is non-exhaustive and omits various items in audio and print format such as  audiobooks ,  radio plays ,  abridged   storybooks , and random derived works such as  cookbooks  and  paper dolls . The appendices of the book's  Norton Critical Edition  contain a more comprehensive analysis of the book's many transformations.     [ edit ]   Live-action     [ edit ]   Films   The first filmed version was made in 1919 by the  Famous Players-Lasky Corporation  with 17 year old  Lila Lee  as Mary and  Paul Willis  as Dickon, but the film is considered lost.   In 1949,  MGM  filmed  the second adaptation  with  Margaret O'Brien . This version was mostly in black-and-white, but the sequences set in the restored garden were filmed in  Technicolor .   The most acclaimed film adaptation is  American Zoetrope 's  1993 production . It was directed by  Agnieszka Holland  and starred  Kate Maberly  as Mary,  Heydon Prowse  as Colin,  Andrew Knott  as Dickon and  Dame Maggie Smith  as Mrs. Medlock.     [ edit ]   Television   Dorothea Brooking  adapted the book into several different television serials for the BBC: an eight-part serial in 1952, a six-part serial in 1960 (starring  Colin Spaull  as Dickon), and a three-part serial in 1975.   In 1987,  Hallmark Hall of Fame  filmed a TV adaptation of the novel starring  Gennie James  as Mary,  Barret Oliver  as Dickon, and  Jadrien Steele  as Colin.  Derek Jacobi  plays the role of Archibald Craven, with  Alison Doody  appearing in flashbacks and visions as Lilias; a young  Colin Firth  also makes a brief appearance as the adult Colin Craven.     [ edit ]   Stage   Stage adaptations of the book have also been created.  One notable adaptation  is a  musical  with music by  Lucy Simon  and book and lyrics by  Marsha Norman , which opened on  Broadway  in 1991. The production was nominated for seven  Tony Awards , winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Daisy Eagan  as Mary, at eleven years old is the youngest person ever to win a Tony).   In 2007 the  Orlando Shakespeare Theater  commissioned April-Dawn Gladu to create an adaptation for their Theater For Young Audiences series. This version's unique qualities include an actress silently playing The Garden Tree, which was the tree that Lilias fell from years ago. As the children work secretly in the garden to bring it to life, the living tree wakes up, flourishes and blooms. [ 10 ]   Oakland Ballet has produced  The Secret Garden  set to music by Sir Edward Elgar. [ 11 ]   The Secret Garden  has also been made into an opera by Clover Loehr & Conan McLemore, and will be presented by Northwest Children's Opera in June of 2009.     [ edit ]   Animation   In 1991, a  Japanese animated  version of  The Secret Garden  was made, entitled  Himitsu no Hanazono . [ 12 ]   As part of the ""ABC Weekend Special"" series, another animated version was made in 1995, with  Derek Jacobi  as the voice of Archibald Craven.   Another anime movie,  Sk no Strain  (2006), based on another Frances Hodgson Burnett novel,  A Little Princess , draws some elements from  The Secret Garden , mostly the names of Colin, Mary, Martha and Dickon. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Sequels     [ edit ]   Written works   Noel Streatfeild 's 1949 novel  The Painted Garden  (U.S. title  Movie Shoes ) has as its central story the filming of  The Secret Garden  in Hollywood. A novel about the adult lives of Mary, Colin, and Dickon was written by  Susan Moody  in 1995 and published under two different titles:  Misselthwaite: The Sequel to the Secret Garden  and  Return to the Secret Garden . The  New York Times  also published a brief parodic sequel [ 14 ]  in 1995. A different sequel novel,  Till All the Seas Run Dry , was written by Susan Webb and published in 1998.     [ edit ]   Dramatic media   A 2000 sequel entitled  Return to the Secret Garden  was directed by  Scott Featherstone  and won the Director's Gold Award at the 2001 Santa Clarita International Film Festival. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   In 2001, the  TV movie   Back to the Secret Garden , directed by Michael Tuchner, shows Mary and Colin as married adults who have made Craven Manor into a shelter for orphans. It starred  Joan Plowright  as Martha and  George Baker  as Will Weatherstaff (a younger relative of Ben Weatherstaff), with  Camilla Belle  as an American orphan, Lizzie.

Orphaned by an outbreak of  cholera , she is sent back to England to the legal guardianship of her only remaining relative: her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a reclusive widower.   Craven still mourns the death of his beautiful young wife, Lilias, from ten years ago. To escape his sad memories, he constantly travels abroad, leaving Mary and the  manor  under the supervision of his  housekeeper , Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   After Mary finds the key to the secret garden, a  robin  shows her where the door is hidden by overgrown ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle visits the house briefly for the first time since she arrived, Mary asks him for a bit of earth to make a flower garden, and he agrees. Thanks to the invigorating Yorkshire air and her new-found fascination with the garden, Mary herself begins to blossom, and loses her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   On several occasions, Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive; they tell her that she is hearing things, or blame the sound on ordinary sources such as the wind or a servant with a toothache. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and both he and Colin are morbidly convinced that the boy will develop the same condition. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums. Colin, however, accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often.   As spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous because Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon than indoors with him. One day he voices his resentment and, when Mary resists, he throws a tantrum. To the surprise and amusement of the servants, Mary continues to stand her ground. That evening, Colin has a  hysterical  fit, brought on by his fear of dying young. Mary goes to him and, again taking a firm, no-nonsense stance with him, slaps him in the face to shock him out of his hysteria; to the servants' surprise, when Mary screams back at him, he doesn't object.   When Colin asks if he can visit the garden with her, she agrees, as she and Dickon had been planning to suggest it themselves, feeling that it would do Colin good. Colin's doctor, who is Mr. Craven's cousin, agrees to let Dickon and Mary take Colin outside in a wheelchair. To maintain their secret, Colin orders everyone else to stay out of the gardens on those occasions. Colin is delighted with his mother's garden, and visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows. As the garden revives and flourishes, so does he.   The first adult to discover what the children are doing is the old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, who was a favorite of Colin's mother. After her death, he visited the locked garden once or twice a year by secretly scaling the wall with a ladder. When he visits the garden for the first time since Mary's arrival (having had to miss several visits because of  rheumatism ), he is angry with the children until he sees how improved both the garden and Colin are. Colin orders him not to tell anybody, and he agrees. Colin resolves that the next time his father returns from abroad he will be able to walk and run like a normal boy. He accomplishes this through a combination of simple physical exercise taught by Dickon and positive thinking. He refuses to think of himself as crippled, and he invents a kind of  mantra  to keep himself in the right, or ""magic,"" frame of mind. He makes great progress, but keeps it hidden from everyone but Mary, Dickon, and Ben, wanting it to be a surprise.   Mr. Craven has been traveling throughout Europe, but is inspired to rush home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream and receiving a letter from Mrs. Sowerby (Martha's and Dickon's mother, who also knows the secret) telling him, ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here"". He arrives while the children are outdoors. He goes out to see Colin for himself, and finds himself drawn to the secret garden, where he is astonished to hear children's voices and then to find Colin not only racing Mary and Dickon around the garden, but winning. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. Afterwards they walk back to the house, where the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.

Howard came to prominence in the 1960s while playing  Andy Griffith 's TV son,  Opie Taylor , on  The Andy Griffith Show  (credited as Ronny Howard), and later in the 1970s as Howard Cunningham's son and  Arthur Fonzarelli 's best friend,  Richie Cunningham , on  Happy Days  (a role he played from 1974 to 1980). Since retiring from acting, he has directed many films including  Apollo 13 ,  A Beautiful Mind ,  Frost/Nixon , and the upcoming sequel to the  The Da Vinci Code ,  Angels and Demons .

[ 1 ]  His family later moved to  Burbank, California , just the year before his parents gave birth to his younger brother,  Clint Howard . Howard graduated from  John Burroughs High School , and later attended the  University of Southern California 's  School of Cinematic Arts  but did not graduate. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Career     [ edit ]   Early acting roles and  The Andy Griffith Show   Howard first earned recognition for playing Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp in the film version of  The Music Man  with  Robert Preston  and  Shirley Jones . Besides appearing in  The Music Man , he appeared in the role of  Opie Taylor  in the television series  The Andy Griffith Show , which was the successful spin-off of  The Danny Thomas Show . There he portrayed the son of the local sheriff in the fictional town of  Mayberry ,  North Carolina . For eight seasons, he created a loving relationship with  Andy Griffith  on-screen, and spent a lot of time with him off-screen when not filming. The credits referred to him as ""Ronny Howard."" He also appeared in the 1963 film  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  with  Glenn Ford  and (billed as ""Ronnie Howard"") in  Little Boy Lost , a 1963 episode of the  NBC   medical drama   The Eleventh Hour  as the character Barry Stewart in the episode entitled ""Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?"", and a 1966 episode of the NBC  adventure  series  I Spy  with  Robert Culp  and  Bill Cosby .   Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.   On a  VH1  special about the 100 greatest  Child Stars , many of the interviewees considered Ron Howard to be the most successful child star of all-time, considering his two major television acting roles and his directing career. [ citation needed ]  In Season 1, Episode 3 of  Stroker and Hoop  on  Adult Swim , Stroker and Hoop ran a detective agency whose first client needed them to make Ron Howard stop controlling his mind.   In October 2008, Howard reprised his roles as Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham for the first time in over 20 years when he appeared in a video on  funnyordie.com  in which he endorsed Barack Obama and urged people to vote. The video, titled  ""Ron Howards Call to Action"" , [ 6 ] also features  Andy Griffith  and  Henry Winkler . As seen in the video, Howard is seen shaving his beard and having hair done to recreate his younger look.

[ 1 ]  His family later moved to  Burbank, California , just the year before his parents gave birth to his younger brother,  Clint Howard . Howard graduated from  John Burroughs High School , and later attended the  University of Southern California 's  School of Cinematic Arts  but did not graduate. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Career     [ edit ]   Early acting roles and  The Andy Griffith Show   Howard first earned recognition for playing Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp in the film version of  The Music Man  with  Robert Preston  and  Shirley Jones . Besides appearing in  The Music Man , he appeared in the role of  Opie Taylor  in the television series  The Andy Griffith Show , which was the successful spin-off of  The Danny Thomas Show . There he portrayed the son of the local sheriff in the fictional town of  Mayberry ,  North Carolina . For eight seasons, he created a loving relationship with  Andy Griffith  on-screen, and spent a lot of time with him off-screen when not filming. The credits referred to him as ""Ronny Howard."" He also appeared in the 1963 film  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  with  Glenn Ford  and (billed as ""Ronnie Howard"") in  Little Boy Lost , a 1963 episode of the  NBC   medical drama   The Eleventh Hour  as the character Barry Stewart in the episode entitled ""Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?"", and a 1966 episode of the NBC  adventure  series  I Spy  with  Robert Culp  and  Bill Cosby .   Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.   On a  VH1  special about the 100 greatest  Child Stars , many of the interviewees considered Ron Howard to be the most successful child star of all-time, considering his two major television acting roles and his directing career. [ citation needed ]  In Season 1, Episode 3 of  Stroker and Hoop  on  Adult Swim , Stroker and Hoop ran a detective agency whose first client needed them to make Ron Howard stop controlling his mind.   In October 2008, Howard reprised his roles as Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham for the first time in over 20 years when he appeared in a video on  funnyordie.com  in which he endorsed Barack Obama and urged people to vote. The video, titled  ""Ron Howards Call to Action"" , [ 6 ] also features  Andy Griffith  and  Henry Winkler . As seen in the video, Howard is seen shaving his beard and having hair done to recreate his younger look.

Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.   On a  VH1  special about the 100 greatest  Child Stars , many of the interviewees considered Ron Howard to be the most successful child star of all-time, considering his two major television acting roles and his directing career. [ citation needed ]  In Season 1, Episode 3 of  Stroker and Hoop  on  Adult Swim , Stroker and Hoop ran a detective agency whose first client needed them to make Ron Howard stop controlling his mind.   In October 2008, Howard reprised his roles as Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham for the first time in over 20 years when he appeared in a video on  funnyordie.com  in which he endorsed Barack Obama and urged people to vote. The video, titled  ""Ron Howards Call to Action"" , [ 6 ] also features  Andy Griffith  and  Henry Winkler . As seen in the video, Howard is seen shaving his beard and having hair done to recreate his younger look.

Howard came to prominence in the 1960s while playing  Andy Griffith 's TV son,  Opie Taylor , on  The Andy Griffith Show  (credited as Ronny Howard), and later in the 1970s as Howard Cunningham's son and  Arthur Fonzarelli 's best friend,  Richie Cunningham , on  Happy Days  (a role he played from 1974 to 1980). Since retiring from acting, he has directed many films including  Apollo 13 ,  A Beautiful Mind ,  Frost/Nixon , and the upcoming sequel to the  The Da Vinci Code ,  Angels and Demons .

[ 1 ]  His family later moved to  Burbank, California , just the year before his parents gave birth to his younger brother,  Clint Howard . Howard graduated from  John Burroughs High School , and later attended the  University of Southern California 's  School of Cinematic Arts  but did not graduate. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Career     [ edit ]   Early acting roles and  The Andy Griffith Show   Howard first earned recognition for playing Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp in the film version of  The Music Man  with  Robert Preston  and  Shirley Jones . Besides appearing in  The Music Man , he appeared in the role of  Opie Taylor  in the television series  The Andy Griffith Show , which was the successful spin-off of  The Danny Thomas Show . There he portrayed the son of the local sheriff in the fictional town of  Mayberry ,  North Carolina . For eight seasons, he created a loving relationship with  Andy Griffith  on-screen, and spent a lot of time with him off-screen when not filming. The credits referred to him as ""Ronny Howard."" He also appeared in the 1963 film  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  with  Glenn Ford  and (billed as ""Ronnie Howard"") in  Little Boy Lost , a 1963 episode of the  NBC   medical drama   The Eleventh Hour  as the character Barry Stewart in the episode entitled ""Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?"", and a 1966 episode of the NBC  adventure  series  I Spy  with  Robert Culp  and  Bill Cosby .   Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.

Yes, I have Michael's permission to use his name and his full message and, no, I'm not going to make fun of it -- I thought he gently raised a point worthy of discussion and it's representative of many e-mails I received yesterday. Here's Michael: Bob,  I understand your sentiments when you wrote that article asking what was Barack thinking with the selection. I am a 61 year old individual who can't believe I lived to see the day when someone like Barack could be elected. It made all the dreams I've had since I worked in Bobby Kennedy's campaign come true. However, please look at what Barack's selection is really saying. The first task our new POTUS  will have is to bring us all together after our beloved nation has been purposefully rendered apart for the past eight years for the most nefarious of reasons. It is why I wonder how truly progressive those who call themselves ""progressives"" really are. No POTUS has ever entered office facing the humongous challenges facing Obama and instead of criticizing him I think it is time we get behind him.  Fair enough, Michael, and I agree to some extent with the spirit of what you're saying.  I've spent no time at all criticizing some of President-elect Obama's cabinet selections that may have raised my eyebrows,  including retaining Robert Gates as Defense Secretary.  While I'm inclined to say Obama should start fresh as he moves to end the Iraq debacle, I'm willing to concede that Gates is undoubtedly clear on Obama's intent to leave Iraq and will follow the Commander-in-Chief's directive. I also give Obama credit for wanting to begin the withdrawal with as little upheaval as possible at the Defense Department. I'm also mindful of the huge challenges Obama is inheriting and the extent to which he needs support and not sniping from his own side of the political divide and, the fact is, I donated money and worked hard to help elect the man. I believe in him and I believe he will be a great president. I say all of this to point out that I'm as far from an Obama basher as you'll find and hated even having to write my piece yesterday -- and I strongly considered not posting it precisely for the points you raise. But this situation is different and his choice of Warren does anything but bring us together as a people. Obama is not including someone from the other side of the aisle who has a mere philosophical difference with Progressives/Liberals and who, for example, may take a different stance on Iraq or stem cell research than we do.  On this day of national pride and celebration, he's chosen to include someone who believes that a certain portion of our population should be demonized and deprived of the same rights enjoyed by other Americans. The President-elect has picked someone to share center stage with him on January 20th who is, tacitly, a self-proclaimed bigot, who strongly supports discrimination against the gay community and who believes gay folks are something less than the rest of us. It is as simple as that and, the last time I looked, that kind of bigotry was considered downright un-American. What Warren believes is not exactly the same as the ugliness we saw during the Civil Rights struggle but it's damn close.  And Rick Warren is someone who essentially takes the same approach toward gay people, based simply on their sexual orientation, as George Wallace,  Bull Connor  and that whole Cracker Brigade took against African-Americans in the 1960s. So I appreciate what you're saying, Michael, and the support you believe we should all show for Barack Obama as he charts some incredibly tough waters ahead.  As I said, I believe he will be a great president and that as the next few years unfold, I will feel far more pride and solidarity with him than I will disappointment. But that doesnt make choosing a known bigot to speak on Inauguration Day something we can ignore.  Barack Obama will be taking that oath of office on January 20th because the majority of Americans, as Dr. King longed for,  looked at the content of his character and not the color of his skin. Our gay family, friends and neighbors deserve nothing less than the same standard of decency.                                posted by Bob Geiger at  12/19/2008 12:27:00 PM                                                            Thursday, December 18, 2008                                            Rick Warren???  What Is Team Obama Thinking?                                      Even through my utter euphoria at Barack Obama being elected president, I knew there would be times in the coming years when I would disagree with certain decisions and policy stances taken by our new Democratic president.  That's a natural thing -- I just didnt think one of those moments would come a month before he's even sworn into office. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies,  has announced  a good program to usher in the Obama presidency on January 20th that, most unfortunately, includes rabid homophobe Rick Warren giving the opening prayer. Warren is a prominent evangelical and founded the Saddleback Church in Southern California, strongly supported California's ugly  Proposition 8  and has long fought against gay rights saying that ""this is not a political issue  it is a moral issue that God has spoken clearly about."" He will give the invocation after Inaugural Committee Chairwoman, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) calls the event to order. My friend Pam Spaulding at  Pam's House Blend  has some excellent coverage going on at her site and brings us some failed spin control from the Obama transition team from spokeswoman Linda Douglas:  ""This is going to be the most inclusive, open, accessible inauguration in American history,"" said Douglas. ""The president-elect certainly disagrees with him on [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender] issues. But it has always been his goal to find common ground with people with whom you may disagree on some issues."" Please also check out  AMERICAblog  for what will certainly be outstanding coverage of every aspect of this nonsense. My take on this is that President-elect Obama and his staff are being incredibly disrespectful to Progressives who were a major part of getting the Obama-Biden ticket elected and having Warren anywhere near the festivities on January 20th is just flat-out stupid politically. People in the Religious Right will  never  support Barack Obama or his agenda, so giving a homophobic bigot like Warren such a prominent place on such a special day for our country will do absolutely nothing to gain Obama support from that lot.  Meanwhile, he will piss off a lot of his supporters before he even takes office and will be going against what the mainstream of America thinks by boosting someone who is anti-choice, for continuation of the Iraq occupation and who clearly hates gay people. And, of course, Warren's also at least a partial nut job, as shown in things like the episode on Sean Hannity's show in which he responds to Hannity saying we need to ""take out"" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by saying that stopping evil is the legitimate role of government. The Bible says that God puts government on earth to punish evildoers. Here's Warren's who-would-Jesus-bomb moment: This isnt change any of us can believe in and Obama needs to find a graceful way to have someone else --  anyone  else -- do the opening prayer on his big day.  He also needs to remember that this isn't just  his  big day, it's also a huge occasion for our country and he has a responsibility to present people who represent the best of American life, not the worst. This isnt a prime-time television special, so it isn't even necessary to pick someone who is well known -- how about a community-organizer member of the clergy who toils with silent dignity and doesn't support and defend discrimination?  How about giving one of them a place on the national stage? But a confirmed bigot?  No way. Update:  If you haven't read  John Aravosis's piece  in the Huffington Post, he does a beautiful job inventing a dialog that explains why the Warren choice is so awful far better than I ever could.

This week, the award goes to Glenn Beck for completing a classic right-wing, two-for-one deal: He  invents  a problem with a Democrat -- in this case, Hillary Clinton -- and then proceeds to analyze and find fault with a situation that nobody envisions and that will never happen. Specifically, Beck was talking to that famed political genius, Joe the Plumber -- and here you thought his 15 minutes were over -- and they were both a bit aghast about the thought of Senator Clinton serving as a U.S. Senator  and  being Secretary of State at the same time.  Of course, that scenario is not planned, nor would it ever happen -- but when you're a conservative radio host, you dont need to worry about having listeners smart enough to call you on this. BuzzFlash comes in right after the part where Beck says that ""&one of my guys who's deep in the Constitution, he's saying that she can't have two offices. That's the problem.""  Hey, Glenn: ""one of my guys"" doesn't know what he is talking about. And neither do you. Nobody, and we mean nobody, thinks Clinton, or anyone else would do both jobs at the same time. Being a U.S. Senator is a lot of work, and being Secretary of State is a huge amount of work. And the whole idea that ""it's kind of iffy on that."" Are you now saying Clinton might legally occupy both posts as you are saying that she couldn't be both? And what does this have to do with the subject being talked about in the United States on the planet Earth? As Keith Olbermann succinctly put it, ""You are less well-informed than Joe the Plumber."" Usually, when the rabid right-winger rants, an argument is presented with lies and misleading statements. Here we have an argument that is a lie, a fiction no one ever thought to create. And Beck doesn't even have the guts to say this from his own heart: he hides behind referring to ""one of my guys who's deep in the Constitution."" To be fair, this is probably why right-wing talk shows such as Beck do get the Republican talking points. Because when they come up with their own talking points, they screw them up. If someone else does not write down for Beck, there apparently is this chance Beck will go off and come up with tangents such as this.

And Chris Cillizza  reports yesterday  that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has made a call to Paterson urging him to select Kennedy -- and if this is true, I agree with Senator Reid. There's two basic schools of thought around Paterson selecting Kennedy to replace Clinton:  One is that she's a political neophyte who has spent her life avoiding the spotlight and that she simply isnt qualified.  The other is that she's serious, smart, has name recognition and star quality -- perhaps those two go hand-in-hand with the Kennedy name? -- and that she'll be up to the task. At this point, I fall into the latter group. There's no doubt that there's more experienced politicians who could get the nod from Paterson, but Republicans are salivating over the thought of possibly being able to pick up this seat in 2010 and who will run best in that race has to be a consideration in the selection process. Although she appears a bit shy and tentative when speaking in public, Caroline Kennedy will grow on the campaign trail in 2010.  I also believe people will be drawn to her and, if appointed, she will make a formidable, compelling candidate two years from now. She will also have strong support from President-elect Obama -- who she endorsed and for whom she campaigned this year -- and she will be helped very ably by Reid, New York's senior Senator Chuck Schumer and will undoubtedly surround herself with an experienced Senate staff who will guide her through all the administrative minutia of the office. We dont know when Paterson will make his choice as the seat is not even formally up for grabs until Hillary Clinton is confirmed for her next job and resigns from the Senate. And I guess you should take my words as just more fodder for a debate that will continue throughout the holiday season.  Especially with me having watched Democrats be such a minority in Washington for the bulk of the last eight years, I fully admit that I'm a fierce partisan who wants nothing more than to extend the Democratic majority in both houses of Congress going forward. So in some ways, I'm a single-issue voter on how this is decided -- and I'm ""voting"" for who I think can retain this Senate seat in 2010.                                 posted by Bob Geiger at  12/17/2008 03:04:00 PM                                                                                                Who To Replace Salazar? It Should Be An Improvement&                                      Now that Senator Ken Salazar (D-CO) has been nominated by President-elect Barack Obama to be the new Secretary of the Interior -- and will certainly be confirmed based on qualifications and a favorable Democratic Senate majority -- all eyes in Colorado go to see who will replace Salazar in the 111th Congress. Salazar was up for reelection in 2010 anyway and whoever this person may be will have to make a full run for the seat then -- this happens anyway when you're appointed to the Senate. In my mind, it will be hard for anyone not to be an improvement over Salazar who as part of the infamous "" Gang of 14 "" in the Senate, proved he is a Democrat who is hardly a lock to vote with the Democratic party on important issues. Nate Silver, at  FiveThirtyEight.com , has a good rundown today on the pool of candidates from which Colorado Governor Bill Ritter will likely make his pick. Please  go here  to read the post. As far as I'm concerned, selecting Senator Salazar's brother John, who is in his third Congressional term for Colorado would be a big mistake.  A conservative Democrat, John Salazar is a member of the disgusting  Blue Dog Caucus  in the House  -- you know, people who wake up and decide over their morning coffee whether they are a Democrat or a Republican on a given day. Obama's new Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) need to be making a few calls to Ritter to urge against that. I lean toward Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper or Congresswoman Diana DeGette.  Both would be improvements over Salazar in the area of Progressive dependability and both would be a boost toward our new president being able to move the agenda that got him elected.                                 posted by Bob Geiger at  12/17/2008 12:49:00 PM                                                            Tuesday, December 16, 2008                                            Reid Announces Senate Committee Chairmanships For 111th Congress                                       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) yesterday announced his recommendations to the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee regarding committee chairmanships for the 111th Congress. I am pleased to recommend these capable men and women to chair the Senates Committees during the 111th Congress,"" said Reid on Monday. ""We have much work to do and many challenges facing our nation. I know that these Senators will be able to deliver on the change that the American people have called for to help move our country in the right direction. Here's the list of anticipated Chairmanships for the 111th Congress. Change in Chairmanship Daniel Inouye (D-HI), Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations;   Replaces Robert Byrd (D-WV), who resigned his chairmanship. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation;  Was Inouye, who becomes chair of the Appropriations Committee. John Kerry (D-MA), Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations; Upon the resignation of Joe Biden (D-DE). Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Chairwoman, Senate Intelligence Committee; Was Rockefeller, who will now chair the Commerce Committee. Charles Schumer (D-NY), Chairman, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration; Was Feinstein, who will now chair the Intelligence Committee. Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Chairwoman, Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship; Was Kerry, who will now be chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. No Change in Chairmanship Herb Kohl (D-WI), Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging Tom Harkin (D-IA), Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture Carl Levin (D-MI), Chairman, Senate Committee on Armed Services Christopher Dodd (D-CT), Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Kent Conrad (D-ND), Chairman, Senate Committee on Budget Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairwoman, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Joseph Lieberman (I-CT), Chairman, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Chairman, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Chairman, Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs Final approval will be ratified with an Organizing Resolution when the Senate returns to session in January 2009, but it is highly unlikely that this roster will change.                                 posted by Bob Geiger at  12/16/2008 10:45:00 AM                                                                                                Kerry Comes Full Circle on Foreign Relations Committee                                       On April 22, 1971, young Lieutenant Junior Grade John F. Kerry appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations committee to give testimony in hearings about ending the Vietnam war.  The opportunity put Kerry center stage in the anti-war movement and, sadly,  would later become the linchpin in Republican attacks on his patriotism when he became the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004. Of course the rest is history and the Senate part of Kerry's story began when he was elected to that body in 1984 and he has been a member of the Foreign Relations committee ever since. And things really came full circle on Monday when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) announced that Kerry would be the new chairman of that powerful committee for the 111th Congress, which convenes in January. I am honored to serve as Chairman of a committee which I know from my own experience as a young man can impact the course of our security and help advance our values and interests in the world,"" said Kerry.  ""I look forward to working with all members of the committee to help strengthen Americas hand in Afghanistan and Pakistan, work towards global climate change solutions, and end the war in Iraq responsibly."" ""We have a big agenda ahead of us, just as our country faces big challenges across the globe. During his tenure on the committee, Senator Kerry has chaired the Asia and Middle East subcommittees and authored and passed major legislation on international drug trafficking, global AIDS, international money laundering, and climate change  and negotiated the UNs genocide tribunal to prosecute war crimes in Cambodias Killing Fields. John will do an excellent job as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the nations fortunate to have him in this high position,"" said Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA). ""I know hell make significant contributions to our foreign policy in dealing with the many challenges we face in our relationships with other countries, and hell work well with President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton to restore Americas respect in the world. Kerry assumes his chairmanship with Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) moving on to the White House and the only Democratic colleague with more seniority, Chris Dodd (D-CT), choosing to remain chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committee.                                 posted by Bob Geiger at  12/16/2008 09:15:00 AM                                                            Monday, December 15, 2008                                            Another Clue On Why We Like Obama                                      In the January 2009 issue of Esquire magazine, New Mexico Governor and Commerce Secretary nominee Bill Richardson gives us another clue as to why so many Americans have been drawn to Barack Obama.  Here's part of the interview in which Richardson, a Democratic presidential candidate this year,  tells of Obama being a total gentleman and saving his butt during one of the primary debates: As I'm chatting with Obama, the moderator says, ""Governor Richardson, what do you think of that?"" And I look at him like a deer in the headlights. I was about to say that I hadn't heard, when Obama puts his hand over his mouth and says, ""Katrina."" So I gave my four-point plan on Katrina. When I was done and the debate moved on, I looked over and said, ""Thanks, you're okay."" He said, ""Nothing to it, brother."" It confirmed to me that this guy was something special.  There's an old saying about how the word integrity means doing the right thing when nobody is looking -- there you have it.                                 posted by Bob Geiger at  12/15/2008 12:15:00 PM                                                                                                The President-Elect's Weekly Address                                      In case you missed it, here is President-elect Barack Obama with his weekend radio/web address in which he discussed a major part of the country's economic problems -- the mortgage crisis.  He also used the opportunity to formally announce that he has selected Shaun Donovan, New York City's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development to be the next U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. ""In the end, expanding access to affordable housing isnt just about caring for the least fortunate among us and strengthening our middle class -- its about ending our housing mess, climbing out of our financial crisis, and putting our economy on the path to long-term growth and prosperity,"" said Obama.  ""And that is what Shaun and I will work to do together when I am President of the United States.""

As always, it's a grueling process to narrow the selection to just one Republican hypocrite, and this week BuzzFlash went with one of the most prolific hypocrites in the GOP universe, Rudy Giuliani. This one was a no-brainer, with Giuliani having the nerve to come out recently and say that  it was a good thing for America that  Barack Obama got elected -- after doing everything he could to help the Republicans smear Obama during the presidential campaign. A BuzzFlash excerpt:  So, let's get this straight. Now that a man that you disparaged at every opportunity is our incoming president, we can stop being hypocritical? Clearly Giuliani isn't including himself in that ""we,"" because that statement alone drips with hypocrisy. While he lauds Obama's election these days, it wasn't always so. At the Republican National Convention in September, Giuliani laughed at Obama's work as a community organizer. ""He's never had to lead people in crisis. He is the least experienced candidate for president of the United States in at least the last 100 years,"" Giuliani said in making the case for a President McCain. ""The choice in this election comes down to substance over style."" But that's not the only part about the interview that's two-faced. One of his main points about the positives of having Obama in the White House is that it will improve the United States' image abroad. Yet on July 10, 2008, Giuliani said on ""Morning Joe"" that the reason Obama is so well-liked in Europe is that he captures anti-American sentiment.  You can read the rest at  GOPhypocrites.com  and see a historical list of BuzzFlash's other worthy selections.                                 posted by Bob Geiger at  12/12/2008 02:00:00 PM                                                                                                Feingold Calls On Obama To ""Restore Rule of Law"" In America                                      Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI), as a key member of both the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees, has been battling the Bush administration for many years over the litany of Constitutional abuses that will be George W. Bush's legacy.  And this week, the Wisconsin Senator called on Barack Obama to use his opportunity as president  to ""& take concrete steps to restore the rule of law in this country."" Feingold sent a letter to Obama on Wednesday making this plea and outlining steps he believes are necessary to make that happen. In light of this recent history, I believe that one of the most important things that you can do as President is to take concrete steps to restore the rule of law in this country  that is, to return to the White House respect for an appropriate separation and balance of powers among the branches, for the Presidents important but not paramount place in our constitutional system of government, for the laws that Congress writes and the importance of its oversight functions, and for the judiciarys crucial role in interpreting the law, Feingold wrote. Feingold then offered recommendations for action in four key areas  the separation of powers, excessive government secrecy, detention and interrogation policy, and domestic surveillance and privacy.   He also provided additional points made during a Judiciary Committee hearing he chaired in September called Restoring the Rule of Law. Those recommendations include: Closing the facility at Guantanamo Bay, which the President-elect already supports. Banning torture and establishing a single, government-wide standard of humane detainee treatment Conducting a comprehensive review of Office of Legal Counsel opinions and repudiating or revising those that overstate executive authority Supporting significant legislative changes to the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act Cooperating with congressional oversight, including providing full information to intelligence committees"

But the mechanical- engineering  major already has her first employer lined up.   If she wants it, Sola has a job waiting for her at Pratt & Whitney, an aircraft-engine, space-propulsion-system and gas-turbine maker in East Hartford, Conn., when she graduates from Massachusetts’s Worcester Polytechnic Institute next year. Not a bad position to be in, given the job market for new grads.   Many undergraduates have had a particularly hard time landing jobs lately because of competition from experienced candidates, says Bill Krutzen, director of operations at HireDiversity.com, an Internet job board. “What makes matters worse is that the experienced jobless are prepared to take a newly graduated person’s salary as they are so desperate for work,” he says.   But  information-technology  and engineering graduates of color have an easier time in the job market “because there’s so few of them,” says Stephanie Blaisdell,  director of diversity  and women’s programs at Worcester Polytechnic, an engineering university. “Nationally, only 6.6% of  African-Americans  and 7% of  Hispanics  pursue engineering,” she says. “And less than 1% [of engineers] are  Native American .”   Employers’ interest in  diversity hiring  helped all of WPI’s minority 2003 graduates secure jobs quickly. Even during the downturn, recruiting minority students remained a priority for many companies, says Sharon Lutz, director of the Ford Careers Center at the University of Texas in Austin. She adds that many  employers  are “extremely aggressive” about hiring them.   Degrees Can Dictate Demand   Demand for minority students varies by discipline but is particularly strong for those in engineering and technological fields, says John Miller, president and publisher of Equal Opportunity Publications Inc., which publishes Hispanic Engineer,  Woman  Engineer and other magazines. Recruitment ads in the company’s minority engineering titles were up 25% in 2003 from fall 2002, he notes. The  job market for minority graduates  should improve further by spring 2004, raising the company’s ad revenue another 5% to 10%.   Lucrative  government  contracts have caused this latest recruiting surge for minority engineers. The government requires contractors to meet guidelines regarding  minority employment . For defense contractors, $380 billion in business is at stake, and many companies need diversity to win a share, Miller says. That means “proving to government watchdogs that a good-faith effort is [being] made to recruit diversity,” he says.   Meanwhile, savvy global marketers, such as Xerox Corp. and Dell Inc., are hoping to hire more employees of color to address changing customer demographics. Consumers in the U.S. are becoming more diverse, and global markets are growing more important to overall revenues.   Companies Get Competitive   At Rutgers University in New Jersey, career-services director Richard White meets weekly with representatives of such companies as Johnson & Johnson, IBM Corp., Pfizer Inc. and Citigroup, which have  diversity programs  designed to entice the best students of color, he says. Hispanic, African-American and Native American students who have good academic records and relevant  internship  experience are especially prized recruits.   “Although we aren’t hiring as much as before [the recession], when we do, the emphasis is on quality, high-performing students,” says Joe Hammill, Xerox’s manager of talent acquisition. Xerox starts forging relationships with minority undergraduates when they start their degree programs, he says. “To get the highfliers early, we have to win over the best candidates well before they graduate, because the competition, particularly for talented technical undergraduates, is extremely intense,” he says.   Xerox taps into the pool of talented minority students by maintaining relationships with historically  black  colleges and universities with significant Hispanic-student populations. The company also recruits through its black and Hispanic college liaison programs and chapters of professional organizations such as the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, says Hammill.   The Role of Liaison Officers   Liaison officers are Xerox employees and alumni of the particular universities. They visit campuses to meet with faculty and students to discuss potential careers opportunities at Xerox and to assist students with developmental needs. “We also help out with  resumes , access to  mentors  and possible internships,” says Xerox employee and liaison officer Kelia Pea, 31. The program gives Xerox an advantage “because it provides us with links and access to the best students of color,” she says.   Pea joined Xerox five years ago after completing undergraduate and graduate degrees in industrial engineering at the University of Buffalo. She was inundated with job offers from various employers, but Xerox’s liaison program won her over, and she became part of the company’s asset-management diversity program for African-Americans and Hispanics. She has held positions in project management, manufacturing engineering, supply-chain management and  human resources . Her next role is project manager of service development for Xerox global services.   Prospects for Nontechnical Grads   In fields less technical than engineering, some students of color have it just as tough or tougher in the job market than nonminority graduates. Aquyla Walker, a 22-year-old African-American, has been  job hunting  with little success since graduating in May from Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., with a dual degree in English and world literature and fiction writing.   “I began my search initially for a  career in public relations , and then extended it to a diversity-related role, preferably at an academic organization, but despite an intensive  job search , I have not had much luck in either,” says Walker. “Nor have fellow students who pursued business degrees.”   Employers say they want diversity, but Walker challenges these claims. “Students like myself believe that firms are doing little more than paying lip-service to diversity,” she says.   How to Boost Your Odds   Still, students of color can improve their odds of getting professional jobs by graduation, especially if they start their searches early, says Chuck Knippen, campus-diversity-programs manager at Monster Worldwide Inc., an Internet job-posting firm based in New York City.   Large companies are making an effort to demonstrate that their environments are conducive for minority hires and that there’s potential for advancement, says Knippen. Minority students can improve their prospects of joining such companies by seeking them out, he says.   “Attend  career fairs  and build a relationship with the companies you want to work for,” he advises. “Do some research to find out exactly what the recruiting standards are and what type of attributes they’re looking for and work towards that. If you do it early, even in the second or third year of [college], you won’t have to put so much pressure on yourself in the senior year.”   Many employers also are looking for relevant experience on resumes. Internships are highly recommended, because they make students more marketable, says Pea, but some students can’t afford to participate in them because they’re unpaid.   A Student Does It All   Sola sought every advantage she could. She worked with Inroads Inc., a national organization, based in St. Louis, Mo., that helps students of color find internships, particularly in science, engineering and business fields. “They hooked me up with Pratt & Whitney, and I interned for several semesters with them since high school,” she says. The internships, plus taking advantage of other diversity programs, helped her win the  job offer , she says.   Students of color also can sidestep the competition by using  diversity-oriented Internet job sites . “If you use a diversity or profession-specific board, you’ll not only be targeting jobs more carefully, but improving your odds of getting a job,” says Krutzen.   Even if employers are seeking graduates of color in your field, don’t become complacent, says Lutz. Whether or not demand is strong, minority students still must be competitive. Take advantage of campus  career resources , prepare thoroughly for  interviews  and present a professional image, she advises. By doing so, you’ll have myriad opportunities open to you and be in the enviable position of choosing the career of your dreams.   About the Author   Ms. Sappal, the former editor of GlobalHR magazine, is a free-lance writer in London.

Watch it on TV. There’s Cuban-American singing star Gloria Estefan in a music video on MTV  Latino . See it at the cinema. The film version of The Joy Luck Club, based on the popular novel by Chinese-American author Amy Tan, could be playing nearby. Theater? There’s the modern-dance show Griot New York, directed by Jamaican-American choreographer Garth Fagan. Poetry? Buy a book of verse by St. Lucian-born, Nobel-prizewinning poet Derek Walcott, who teaches at Boston University. Painting? New York’s Asia Society is holding a show that tours the country next year featuring  Asian-American  visual artists who emigrated from Vietnam, Thailand and elsewhere in Asia.   And that’s just the beginning. “All American art is a function of the hybrid culture that resulted from centuries of immigration to this nation,” says David Ross, director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. “We’re just more dramatically aware of it today.” American culture used to be depicted as a Eurocentric melting pot into which other cultures were stirred and absorbed. The recent waves of newcomers have changed that. Today it seems more like a street fair, with various booths, foods and peoples, all mixing on common sidewalks.   The new cultural carnival is most apparent in music. The New York-based, Irish-American group  Black  47, which mixes rap, reggae and traditional Irish melodies, has appeared on both the Tonight Show and Late Night with Conan O’Brien. The Los Angeles rap trio Cypress Hill, which includes an Italian American, a Cuban American and a member who is of Cuban and Mexican descent, released a hit album this year that started out at No. 1 on Billboard magazine’s album chart. Latin music has become such a significant force in pop music that MTV recently launched MTV Latino as a separate Spanish-language edition.   Cuban-born Estefan, with her dance-floor blend of R. and B. and Cuban polyrhythms, has established herself as the queen of the new Latin sound. Arriving in Miami from Havana when she was two years old, she grew up in a household immersed in traditional Cuban ballads. By the first grade, she was also listening to British-invasion bands. “It was natural to blend both elements,” says Estefan. “When immigrants come to America they bring their culture, and that culture becomes part of a new country. It makes everyone stronger.”   Her success helped launch other Latin acts. Cuban-born singer Jon Secada, who co-wrote several of Estefan’s best-selling songs, has since recorded his own hits, which combine elements of Cuban music, Top 40 and gospel. Says Secada: “Artists who want to experiment find a way of incorporating the things that are worthy from all types of music, like reggae, salsa and African sounds. And it finds a way onto the charts.”   The  fashion industry  has also felt the impact of newcomers. Immigrants from Asia have brought a clean, elegant new look to clothing design. Among them is Han Feng, who left Hangzhou, China, only eight years ago. Now head of her own design company, she sells easy-to-wear, simply shaped clothes to Bloomingdale’s and Saks. “Designers have been looking for a style for the ’90s,” says Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice president for fashion direction at Bloomingdale’s. “The simplified Oriental-inspired look might be a major look.”   African clothing, filtered through rap culture, influences fashion as well. The L.A.-based firm Threads for Life (also known as Cross Colours) sells hip- hop fashion inspired by urban youth and African designers, such as overalls with colorful kente-cloth patches. “It becomes not just a pair of jeans, but something that means something,” says firm co-owner Carl Jones. Company sales rose from $15 million in 1991 to $89 million in 1992.   The Joy Luck Club, born as a best-selling book, leads a recent surge in popular new movies written or directed by  Asians . They include M. Butterfly, written by David Henry Hwang, the U.S.-born son of Chinese immigrants; the comedy Combination Platter, directed by Chinese-American filmmaker Tony Chan; and The Wedding Banquet, a comedy directed by Ang Lee, who moved to the U.S. from Taiwan. Asian-style kickboxing movies have found an eager audience in the U.S. Recently one of Hong Kong’s best filmmakers, John Woo, relocated to Los Angeles to direct the action movie Hard Target (which stars Belgian-born martial-arts hero Jean-Claude Van Damme).   These Asian films are already spawning would-be imitators. “When something becomes a commercial success,” says novelist Tan, “it automatically opens the door, or at least the possibility, for other similar ventures. Already, in Hollywood, I’m hearing about people saying, ‘We think this will be another Joy Luck Club,’ about  films  they want to get produced.”   Hispanics  in Hollywood, despite barriers, have also met with recent success. Latino actors Andy Garcia and Rosie Perez have become sought-after talents; the movie La Bamba grossed more than $50 million and sent the signal that Latino movies can be moneymakers. “In American society, transmitting culture is done in the marketplace,” says Gary Puckrein, editor in chief of American Visions, a magazine that covers culture in the U.S. “You see it in food, fashion, music and art.”   Other talented Latinos seek the big break. Actress Marga Gomez’s one-woman show, Memory Tricks, which deals with her father, a Cuban comic, and her mother, a Puerto Rican dancer, has been praised for its humor and startling candor. Gomez helped found the Latino comedy group Culture Clash (the troupe has a new series airing on Fox TV, where Gomez has made guest appearances), and she is adapting her show into a screenplay. “I think the essence of my $ work is that I come from some very strong backgrounds — gay, Cuban, Puerto Rican,” says Gomez, “and I don’t feel like I don’t fit into any one of them.”   In the visual arts, cultural outsiders often see what insiders miss. Japanese-born painter Masami Teraoka combines elements of European art and Japanese ukiyo-e wood-block imagery. From his unique perspective, he creates gothic halos around the heads of AIDS patients and condoms in the bedrooms of samurai. In his Harlem neighborhood, Jamaican-American artist Nari Wood collects discarded baby carriages and ties them together with fire hoses, making monuments to loss.   Such outsider viewpoints — from new Americans and even  Native Americans  — can influence others to see the world in a different light. To dramatize how the forces that ravaged the buffalo still exist, Native American sculptor Bob Haozous constructed 100 steel buffalo, then videotaped art-gallery patrons fighting to buy the pieces before they were sold out. Korean-American Nam June Paik, whose influential multimedia artworks incorporate TVs and computers, says he was talking about the information superhighway in his own work long before it became a catchword. And architect Maya Ying Lin, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, designed the black wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a stark monument that compels visitors not to revel in the glory of war, but to reflect on its sorrows.   Other artists have turned their sights on the nature of the immigrant experience itself.  Choreographer  Fagan’s touring show Griot New York features sets by noted sculptor Martin Puryear and music by trumpet virtuoso Wynton Marsalis. Employing a multiethnic troupe, Griot seeks to capture the drama of immigration. Says Fagan: “It’s a celebration of New York City, of West Indians, Indians and Africans, of big urban metropolises that are always being dumped on.” Fagan also wrote a poem to illustrate the show’s theme of  diverse people  traveling difficult routes to come together in one nation:   Ships Hold/ No Class   Reservations & plantations   concentration . . .   You/me/them/us/brethren/we/be   Celebrate   The celebration was a long time coming. To be an immigrant artist is to be a hyphen away from one’s roots, and still a thousand miles away. But it is often that link to a foreign land — another way of seeing things — that allows such artists to contribute ideas to American culture that are fresh and new. That slim hyphen, that thin line that joins individual Americans to their past, is also what connects all America to its future.   With reporting by Greg Aunapu/Miami and Georgia Harbison/New York   Source :  Time.com     Keywords: Culture and Work    diversity in the workplace    Ethnicity and Work    Workplace Diversity   Sphere It                                 Ignoring Diversity, Runways Fade to White       posted at 18 October 2007 by  diversitygirl              By Guy Trebay   IN the days of blithe racial assumptions, flesh crayons were the color of white people. Invisible makeup and nude pantyhose were colored in the hues of Caucasian skin. The decision by manufacturers to ignore whole segments of humanity went unchallenged for decades before the civil rights movement came along and nonwhite consumers started demanding their place on the color wheel.   Nowadays the cultural landscape is well populated with actors, musicians, media moguls and candidates for the American presidency drawn from the 30 percent of the American population that is not white. Yet, if there is one area where the lessons of chromatic and  racial diversity  have gone largely unheeded, it is fashion. This reality was never plainer than during the recent showings of the womens spring 2008 collections in New York and Europe.   Although  black women  in the United States spend more than $20 billion on apparel each year, according to estimates by TargetMarketNews.com, it was hard to discern an awareness of this fact on the part of designers showing in New York, where  black  faces were more absent from runways than they have been in years.   Of the 101 shows and presentations posted on Style.com during the New York runway season, which ended a month ago, more than a third employed no black models, according to Womens Wear Daily. Most of the others used just one or two. When the fashion caravan moved to London, Paris and Milan, the most influential shows  from Prada to Jil Sander to Balenciaga to Chlo and Chanel  made it appear as if someone had hung out a sign reading: No Blacks Need Apply.   Its the worst its ever been, said Bethann Hardison, a former model who went on to start a successful model agency in the 1980s that promoted racial diversity.   AMONG the people she represented were Naomi Campbell and Tyson Beckford, the chiseled hunk who broke barriers in the 1990s by becoming the unexpected symbol of the country-club fantasia that is a Ralph Lauren Polo campaign.   Its heartbreaking for me now because the agents send the girls out there to castings and nobody wants to see them, said Ms. Hardison, referring to black models. And if they do, theyll call afterward and say, Well, you know,  black girls  do much better in Europe, or else black girls do much better in New York, or we already have our black girl.   Last month in New York, Ms. Hardison convened a panel of  fashion  experts at the Bryant Park Hotel to discuss The Lack of the Black Image in Fashion Today, an event she will reprise Monday at the New York Public Library on 42nd Street. Modeling is probably the one industry where you have the freedom to refer to people by their color and reject them in their work, she said.   The exclusion is rarely subtle. An agent for the modeling firm Marilyn once told Time magazine of receiving requests from fashion clients that baldly specified Caucasians only.   The message is not always so blatant these days, but it is no less clear. Take for example the case of two young models, one white, one black, both captivating beauties at the start of their careers. Irina Kulikova, a feline 17-year-old Russian, appeared on no fewer than 24 runways in New York last month, a success she went on to repeat in Milan with 14 shows, and in Paris with 24 more. Honorine Uwera, a young Canadian of Rwandan heritage, was hired during the New York season for just five runway shows.   While Ms. Uweras showing was respectable, it was not enough to justify the cost to her agency of sending her to Europe, where most modeling careers are solidified.   We represent a lot of ethnic girls, said Ivan Bart, the senior vice president of IMG Models, which represents a roster of the commercially successful models of the moment, among them black superstars like Alek Wek, Ms. Campbell and Liya Kebede.   We have new girls, too, Mr. Bart added, young comers like Ms. Uwera, Quiana Grant and Mimi Roche. We include them in our show package, give them the same promotion as any other girl, and get the same responses: Shes lovely, but shes not right for the show.   Although, in fact, Ms. Roche and Ms. Grant, both black, were seen on runways in the last five weeks, the reality was that only one black model worked at anything like the frequency of her white counterparts: Chanel Iman Robinson, 17, who is  African-American  and  Korean . Particularly in Milan and Paris, Ms. Robinsons was often the only nonwhite face amid a blizzard of Eastern European blondes.   It is not just a handful of genetically gifted young  women  who are hurt by this exclusion. Vast numbers of consumers draw their information about fashion and identity from runways, along with cues about what, at any given moment, the culture decrees are the new contours of beauty and style.   Years ago, runways were almost dominated by black girls, said J. Alexander, a judge on Americas Next Top Model, referring to the gorgeous mosaic runway shows staged by Hubert de Givenchy or Yves Saint Laurent in the 1970s. Now some people are not interested in the vision of the black girl unless theyre doing a jungle theme and they can put her in a grass skirt and diamonds and hand her a spear.   And some people, said Diane Von Furstenberg, the designer and president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, just dont think about it at all. Ms. Von Furstenberg herself has always employed  models of all ethnicities  on her runways. (This September, she hired seven black women, more perhaps than any single label except Baby Phat and Heatherette.) Yet she is increasingly the exception to an unspoken industry rule.   I always want to do that, she said, referring to the casting of  women of color . I can make a difference. We all can. But so much is about education and to talk about this is an important beginning.   But isnt it strange, she was asked, that she would have to invoke the rhetoric of racial inclusiveness at a time when Oprah Winfrey is the most powerful woman in media, and Barack Obama is running for president?   Why did we go backward? Ms. Von Furstenberg asked.   Agents blame designers for the current state of affairs. Designers insist agents send them nothing but skinny blondes. Magazine editors bemoan the lack of black women with the ineffable attributes necessary to put across the looks of a given season.   The current taste in models is for blank-featured androids, whose looks dont offer much competition to the clothes, pointed out James Scully, a seasoned agent who made his mark casting the richly diverse Gucci shows in the heyday of Tom Ford. In todays climate, it is far more difficult to promote a black woman than her white counterpart.   You want to sell the model on the basis of her beauty, not her race, said Kyle Hagler, an agent at IMG. Yet when he sends models out on casting calls based on what he terms a beauty perspective, omitting any mention to potential clients of race, You always get a call back saying, You didnt tell me she was black.   THE reasons for this may seem obvious, and yet the unconscious bigotry is tricky to pin down.   Im not pointing a finger and saying people are racist, said Ms. Hardison, who nevertheless recounted a recent exchange with the creative director of a major fashion label: She said to me, I have to be honest with you, when a girl walks in, I just dont see color. Meanwhile, they have one girl, or more likely, none in their show.   Ms. Hardison explained: I dont see color? Does that mean, you dont want to see?   There is something illustrative of the entire issue, and the state of the industry, to be found in this Septembers Italian Vogue.   Just one image of a black model appears in the issue, midway through a 17-page article photographed by Miles Aldridge and titled the Vagaries of Fashion. In it, the glacial blond Anja Rubik portrays an indolent, overdressed Park Avenue princess with a gilded apartment, a couture wardrobe, two towhead children and a collection of heavy rocks. The sole black model in the pictorial is more modestly attired, in an aproned pinafore.   She plays the maid.

For the 2003 television movie, see  The Music Man (2003) .       The Music Man         original film poster       Directed by   Morton DaCosta       Produced by   Morton DaCosta  and  Joel Freeman  (uncredited)       Written by   Meredith Willson   Marion Hargrove       Starring   Robert Preston   Shirley Jones   Buddy Hackett   Ron Howard       Music by   Meredith Willson       Cinematography   Robert Burks       Editing by   William H. Ziegler       Distributed by   Warner Bros.       Release  date(s)   June 19 ,  1962       Running time   151 minutes       Language   English       IMDb       The Music Man  is a 1962  film musical  starring  Robert Preston  as Harold Hill and  Shirley Jones  as Marian Paroo. The film is based on the 1957  Broadway musical  of the same name by  Meredith Willson .   The film was one of the biggest hits of the year and highly acclaimed critically. It also at last made Robert Preston into an ""A"" list star in motion pictures, after years of appearing in supporting roles in famous films and in starring roles in ""B"" movies. It also marked one of the first pictures in which Preston's character was not killed off, one of his former screen ""trademarks."" After the success of the film, Preston began getting much better film roles.   Although Preston scored a great success in the original stage version of the show, he was not first choice for the film version, partly because he was not a box office star.  Jack L. Warner , who was notorious for wanting to film stage musicals with stars other than the ones who played the roles onstage, wanted  Frank Sinatra  for the role of Professor Harold Hill, but Meredith Willson insisted upon Preston. [ 1 ]   Cary Grant  was also ""begged"" by Warner to play Hill but he declined, saying ""nobody could do that role as well as Bob Preston"". [ 2 ]   Unusually for a musical film at the time,  Morton DaCosta , who had directed the show onstage, not only directed the film, but produced it as well, ensuring that the film was extremely faithful to the show. The actress  Pert Kelton  and the  Buffalo Bills  also reprised their stage roles. All of the show's songs were retained for the film with the exception of ""My White Knight"", which was replaced by ""Being in Love""; this new song included some of the original song's lyrics. Unlike the Broadway version, the movie appears to take place in the early 20th Century, possibly the  1900s  or 1910s.   In 2005,  The Music Man  was selected for preservation in the United States  National Film Registry  by the  Library of Congress  as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".   Warner Bros. Records  issued the soundtrack album in both  stereophonic  and  monaural  versions.

Several phrases were altered for the film, as the writers felt they were too obscurely Midwestern to appeal to a broader audience;  ""Jeazle Petes!""  is Tommy Djilas's catchphrase in the play, while in the film he exclaims, ""Great honk!""   Shirley Jones found out she was pregnant while filming was already underway; the costume designers kept having to adjust her dresses to conceal her pregnancy. In the scene at the footbridge when Marian and Harold embrace, Shirley Jones says that baby  Patrick  kicked hard enough for Robert Preston to feel him.   When Harold asks about a ""good hotel"", the man replies: ""Try the Palmer House in Chicago"". The  Palmer House  in  Chicago , Illinois was built in 1871; it is now a five-star hotel.   The  woodcuts  of authors seen in the River City Library were popular in  Andrew Carnegie Foundation libraries  of the era.   The portrait seen in City Hall and the photograph in the high school is US President  William H. Taft .   The Music Man  is set in July, 1912.   The backlot used for River City is also used as Hazzard County in  The Dukes of Hazzard  and as Stars Hollow in  Gilmore Girls , which frequently references the film.   To film the final parade scene in 1962, Jack L. Warner selected the marching bands of the  University of California at Los Angeles  and the  University of Southern California . He used many junior high school students from Southern California for the majority of the band. It took about 8 hours of shooting over two days to film the scene.   All the musical instruments for the production were specially made for the film by the Olds Instrument Company in Fullerton, CA. The instruments were then refurbished and sold by Olds with no indication they were ever used in the film.   Actor/director  Ron Howard 's young role as Winthrop Paroo in the film adaptation was used as  meta -joke in an episode of  Happy Days , the  sitcom  on which he later played the role of Richie Cunningham. The character's mother comments that the little boy in  The Music Man  looks ""so much like Richie when he was little.""   In both the stage play and the movie, the School Board was played by the 1950 International Quartet Champions of the  Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America  (SPEBSQSA) , the  Buffalo Bills .   Many members of the Original  Broadway  cast appear in the film, including  Robert Preston ,  Pert Kelton  and Susan Luckey.

The show is based on a story by Willson and Franklin Lacey. The plot concerns  con man  Harold Hill, who poses as a boys' band organizer and leader and sells band instruments and uniforms to naive townsfolk before skipping town with the cash. In River City,  Iowa , prim Marian the librarian sees through him, but when Hill helps her younger brother, Marian begins to fall in love with Harold. Harold, in turn falling for Marian, risks being caught to win her.   In 1957, the show became a hit on  Broadway , winning five  Tony Awards , including Best Musical, and running for 1,375 performances. The  cast album  won the first  Grammy Award  for ""Best Original Cast Album"". The show's success led to revivals and a popular  1962 film adaptation . It is still frequently produced by both professional and amateur theater companies.

[ 1 ]  He first approached producers  Cy Feuer  and Ernest Martin for a television special, and then  MGM  producer  Jesse L. Lasky . After these and other unsuccessful attempts, Willson invited Franklin Lacey to help him edit and simplify the libretto. At this time, Willson considered eliminating a long piece of dialogue about the serious trouble facing River City parents. Willson realized it sounded like a lyric, and transformed it into the now-famous song, ""Ya Got Trouble"". [ 2 ]   The character Marian Paroo was inspired by Marian Seeley of  Provo, Utah , who met Willson during  World War II , when Seeley was a medical records librarian. [ 3 ]  In the original production (and the film), the School Board was played by the 1950 International Quartet Champions of the  Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America  (SPEBSQSA), [ 4 ]  the  Buffalo Bills . Robert Preston claimed that he got the role of Harold Hill despite his limited singing range because, when he went to audition, they were having the men sing ""Trouble"". The producers felt it would be the most difficult song to sing, but with his acting background, it was the easiest for Preston. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Productions   After years of development, a change of producers, almost forty songs (twenty-two were cut), and more than forty drafts, the original  Broadway  production, directed by  Morton DaCosta  and  choreographed  by  Onna White , opened on  December 19 ,  1957  at the  Majestic Theatre . It won five  Tony awards , including Best Musical, even beating out  West Side Story . [ 5 ]  It remained at the Majestic for nearly three years before transferring to  The Broadway Theatre  to complete its 1,375-performance run. The original cast included  Robert Preston  (who went on to reprise his role in the  1962 screen adaptation ) as Harold Hill,  Barbara Cook  as Marian, and  Eddie Hodges  as Winthrop, with  Pert Kelton ,  David Burns  and  Iggie Wolfington  in supporting roles.  Eddie Albert  and  Bert Parks  each replaced Preston later in the run.   The  original cast recording  was released by  Capitol Records  on  January 20 ,  1958  in  stereophonic  &  monaural  versions and held the #1 spot on the  Billboard charts  for twelve weeks, remaining on the charts for a total of 245 weeks. The  cast album  was awarded ""Best Original Cast Album"" at the first  Grammy Awards  ceremony in 1958 and was inducted in 1998 as a Grammy Hall of Fame Award winner. [ 6 ]           Dick Van Dyke  on the 1980  Playbill       After eight previews, the first Broadway revival, directed and choreographed by  Michael Kidd , opened on  June 5 ,  1980 , at the  New York City Center , where it ran for 21 performances. The cast included  Dick Van Dyke  as Hill,  Meg Bussert  as Marian, and  Christian Slater  as Winthrop.   After twenty-two previews, the second Broadway revival, directed and choreographed by  Susan Stroman , opened on  April 27 ,  2000  at the  Neil Simon Theatre , where it ran for 699 performances. The cast included  Craig Bierko  (making his Broadway debut) as Hill and  Rebecca Luker  as Marian.  Robert Sean Leonard  and  Eric McCormack  portrayed Hill later in the run.   The success of the 2000 revival prompted a  2003 television movie  starring  Matthew Broderick  as Hill and  Kristin Chenoweth  as Marian, with  Victor Garber ,  Debra Monk , and  Molly Shannon  in supporting roles.   Willson recorded his trials and tribulations in getting the show to Broadway in his book  But He Doesn't Know The Territory .   In 2008, there was a revival of the show at the Chichester Festival Theatre, England. This starred Brian Conley as Hill and Scarlett Strallen as Marian. This opened to critical acclaim and was nominated for the Whatsonstage.com award for Best Regional Production.

Charlie and another salesman tell the others about a  con man  known as ""Professor"" Harold Hill, whose scam is to convince parents he can teach their musically disinclined children to play musical instruments. On the premise that he will form a band, he takes orders for instruments and uniforms. But once the instruments arrive and are paid for he skips town without forming the band, moving on before he is exposed.  [ 7 ]  The train arrives in River City,  Iowa , and a stranger on the train stands up and declares, ""Gentlemen, you intrigue me. I think I shall have to give Iowa a try."" He picks up his suitcase clearly labelled ""Professor Harold Hill"", and exits the train.   The townspeople of River City describe their reserved, ""chip-on-the-shoulder attitude"" ("" Iowa Stubborn ""). Harold discovers that an old friend, Marcellus, has ""gone straight"" and now lives in town. Marcellus tells Harold that Marian Paroo, the librarian who gives piano lessons, is the only one in town who knows about music. Marcellus informs him that a new  pool table  was just delivered to the town's local  billiard parlor , and as a part of his scheme, Harold convinces River City parents ""that game with the fifteen numbered balls is the devil's tool"" (""Trouble""). Harold follows Marian home and flirts with her, but she pays no attention to him. At home, Marian gives a piano lesson to a little girl named Amaryllis while arguing with her mother, Mrs. Paroo, about her ""standards where men are concerned"" after telling Mrs. Paroo that a stranger followed her home (""Piano Lesson/If You Don't Mind My Saying So""). Marian's self-conscious,  lisping  younger brother Winthrop arrives home, and Amaryllis, who secretly likes him, asks Marian who she should say goodnight to on the evening star since she doesn't have a sweetheart. Marian tells her to just say goodnight to her ""someone"" (""Goodnight, My Someone"").   The next day is  Independence Day , and Mayor Shinn is leading the morning festivities in the high school gym, with the help of his wife, Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn (""Columbia, Gem of the Ocean""). After a Tommy Djilas, a boy from the wrong side of town, sets off a firecracker, interrupting the proceedings, Harold takes the stage and announces to the townspeople that he will prevent ""sin and corruption"" from the pool table by forming a boys' band. He soon excitedly leads them with "" Seventy-Six Trombones "". Mayor Shinn, who owns the billiard parlor, tells the bickering school board to get Harold's credentials, but Harold teaches them to sing as a  Barbershop Quartet  instead (""Ice Cream/Sincere""). Harold also sets up Zaneeta, the mayor's oldest girl, with Tommy, and persuades Tommy to become his assistant. Marian rejects Harold again, and he explains to Marcellus that ""The Sadder But Wiser Girl"" is the one he wants. The town ladies are very excited about the band and the ladies' dance committee Harold plans to form. He asks them about Marian, and they intimate to him that she had an inappropriate relationship with old miser Madison (now dead), who gave the town the library; they also warn Harold that she advocates ""dirty books"" (""Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little""). The school board arrives to collect Harold's credentials, but he leads them in singing ""Goodnight, Ladies"" and slips away.   The next day, Harold walks into the library, but Marian ignores him. He declares his unrequited love for her, leading the teenagers in the library in dance (""Marian the Librarian""). For a moment, Marian forgets her decorum and dances with Harold. He kisses her, and she tries to slap him. He ducks, and she hits Tommy Djilas instead. With Tommy's help, Harold signs up all the boys in town to be in his band, including Winthrop (""Gary, Indiana""). Mrs. Paroo likes Harold and tries to find out why Marian is not interested. Marian describes her ideal man (""My White Knight""). She tries to give Mayor Shinn evidence against Harold that she found in the Indiana State Educational Journal, but they are interrupted by the arrival of the ""The Wells Fargo Wagon"", which delivers the band instruments. When Winthrop forgets to be shy and self-conscious because he is so happy about his new  cornet , Marian begins to fall in love with Harold. She tears the incriminating page out of the Journal before giving the book to Mayor Shinn.     [ edit ]   Act Two   The ladies rehearse their classical dance in the school gym while the school board practices their quartet (""It's You"") for the  ice cream social . Marcellus and the town's teenagers interrupt the ladies' practice, taking over the gym as they dance the "" Shipoopi "". Harold grabs Marian to dance with her, and all the teenagers join in. Regarding Winthrop's cornet, Marian later questions Harold about his claim that ""you don't have to bother with the  notes "". He explains that this is what he calls ""The Think System"", and he arranges to call on Marian to discuss it. The town ladies ask Marian to join their dance committee, since she was ""so dear dancing the Shipoopi"" with Professor Hill (""Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little"" (reprise)). They have reversed their opinions about her books, and they eagerly tell her that ""the Professor told us to read those books, and we simply adored them all!""   That night, the school board tries to collect Harold's credentials again, but he gets them to begin singing ""Lida Rose"" and slips away. Marian, meanwhile, is sitting on her front porch thinking of Harold, and, in counterpoint, asks herself, ""Will I Ever Tell You?"". Winthrop returns home after spending time with Harold and tells Marian and Mrs. Paroo about Harold's hometown, "" Gary, Indiana "". As Marian waits alone for Harold, Charlie Cowell enters with evidence against Harold, hoping to tell Mayor Shinn. He has to leave on the next train, but stops to flirt with Marian. She tries to delay him so he doesn't have time to deliver the evidence, eventually kissing him. As the train whistle blows, she pushes him away. Charlie angrily tells Marian that Harold has a girl in ""every county in Illinois, and he's taken it from every one of them  and that's 102 counties!""   Harold arrives, and after he reminds her of the untrue rumors he's heard about her, she convinces herself that Charlie invented everything he told her. They agree to meet at the footbridge, where Marian tells him the difference he's made in her life ("" Till There Was You ""). Marcellus interrupts and tells Harold that the uniforms have arrived. He urges Harold to take the money and run, but Harold refuses to leave, insisting, ""I've come up through the ranks... and I'm not resigning without my commission"". He returns to Marian, who tells him that she knows he's a fraud, but she still loves him. He said he was a graduate of Gary Conservatory, Gold-Medal Class of '05, but the town wasn't even built until '06! Harold walks her home, and she sings ""Goodnight my Someone"" while he sings ""Seventy-Six Trombones"". Harold realizes that he is in love with Marian, and each sings the other's song.   Meanwhile, Charlie Cowell, who has missed his train, arrives at the ice cream social and denounces Harold Hill as a fraud. The townspeople begin an agitated search for Harold. Winthrop is heartbroken and tells Harold that he wishes Harold never came to River City. But Marian tells Winthrop that she believes everything Harold ever said, for it did come true in the way every kid in town talked and acted that summer. She and Winthrop urge Harold to get away. He chooses to stay and tells Marian that he never really fell in love ""Till There Was You"" (reprise) as the constable handcuffs Harold and leads him away.   Mayor Shinn is leading a meeting in the high school gym to decide what to do with Harold, asking, ""Where's the band? Where's the band?"" Tommy enters as a drum major, followed by the kids in uniform with their instruments. Marian urges Harold to lead the band, and when he does, he is rewarded with unanticipated redemption: uncritical parents marvel and cheer as the River City Boys' Band performs the  Minuet in G . The play ends as Harold is released into Marian's arms.

Similarly, ""Goodnight, My Someone"" is the same tune, in waltz time, as the march-tempo ""Seventy-six Trombones."" Willson's counterpoint, along with two counterpoint song pairs from  Irving Berlin  musicals, are lampooned in the 1959 musical  Little Mary Sunshine . It combines  three  counterpoint songs: ""Playing Croquet,"" ""Swinging,"" and ""How Do You Do?""   The first recording of "" Till There Was You "" to be released came before the original cast album version. Promotional copies of the 45 rpm single, Capitol P3847, were released on November 26th, 1957, even before the Broadway production had premiered. Produced by  Nelson Riddle , it featured his orchestra and 17-year-old vocalist  Sue Raney . The song had such an effect on  the Beatles  that they covered it, with Paul McCartney on vocals, releasing it on the 1963 LP  With the Beatles .

The ""river"" in River City is probably the  Mississippi , near  Davenport, Iowa : the Rock Island conductor's announcing ""River City, Ioway! Cigarettes illegal in this state"" implies crossing the Mississippi from  Rock Island, Illinois , into Iowa at Davenport or thereabouts.   The character of Mayor Shinn indicates that the year is 1912, but the song ""Trouble"" contains references to both  Captain Billy's Whiz-Bang , a monthly humor magazine that didn't begin publication until October 1919, and the nonalcoholic "" near-beer ""  Bevo , which was first produced in 1916.   The two Paroo children, Marian and Winthrop, were named after towns in eastern Iowa, the former now a suburb of  Cedar Rapids .

The Music Man  is a marvelous show, rooted in wholesome and comic tradition."" [ 8 ]  Though  West Side Story  had opened nearly three months earlier,  The Music Man  managed to capture audiences, critics, and five Tony Awards, including Best Musical.       [ edit ]   In popular culture   The Music Man' s popularity has led to its being mentioned, quoted, parodied or pastiched in a number of media, including television, films and popular music.     Television     The Music Man  has been parodied in a number of TV shows, including  The Simpsons  episode "" Marge vs. the Monorail "" written by  Conan O'Brien . At some point during the second Broadway revival, O'Brien was approached about playing the role of Harold Hill for a brief run, but he ultimately could not fit it into his schedule. He says, on the DVD commentary track for the aforementioned  Simpsons  episode, that it was the hardest choice he's ever had to make professionally, because  The Music Man  is one of his favorites. O'Brien did, however, as host of the  58th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards , sing a parody version of ""Trouble"" in his opening monologue targeting NBC and their slide in the ratings.   The television program  Family Guy  has parodied the musical at least twice. In the episode "" Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows "", Lois chastises Brian's high standards in a spoof of Mrs. Paroo and Marian in ""Piano Lesson"". In another episode, ""Patriot Games"", Peter showboats after scoring a touchdown by leading a stadium full of people in a rendition of "" Shipoopi "", complete with choreography from the film. In Episode 22 of  Boston Legal , ""Men to Boys"", Alan Shore sings a parody of the song ""Trouble"" to convince patrons of a restaurant not to eat the trout. In an episode of  The Nanny , Fran goes to her high school reunion, where one of her friends' dates sings ""Seventy-six Trombones"". [ citation needed ]  Several  Music Man  songs were used in  Ally McBeal . [ citation needed ]  In the season 5  Angel  episode, ""Destiny"", Eve says, ""we've got trouble with a capital T, that rhymes with P, that stands for prophecy"".     Film     In  The Wedding Singer  Robbie teaches Rosie to sing ""'Til There Was You"" for her 50th wedding anniversary.   In  Romy and Michele's High School Reunion , Michele sings ""The Wells Fargo Wagon"".   In the documentary film ""Get Bruce!"", about comedy writer  Bruce Villanch , Villanch,  Billy Crystal , and composer  Marc Shaiman  offer humorous anecdotes about the issues involved with trying to persuade Meredith Wilson's widow to allow them the right to parody the song ""Trouble"" for one of Crystal's  Academy Award  show opening skits.   To evoke turn of the 20th century  Main Street USA  at some of its theme parks around the world,  Walt Disney Parks and Resorts  uses songs from the show, including: "" 76 Trombones "", "" Iowa Stubborn "", ""Wells Fargo Wagon"", and ""Lida Rose"".

[ 1 ]  It premiered on September 19, 1994 and has been aired on Thursday nights at 10:00 for its entire run. On April 2, 2008, NBC announced that the series will return for its 15th, concluding season. [ 2 ]  Originally scheduled to run for 19 episodes before retiring with a two-hour series finale to be broadcast on March 12, 2009, [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  NBC recently announced it will extend  ER  by an additional three episodes to a full 22 episode order as part of a deal to launch a new series by John Wells. [ 5 ]  ER's final episode is scheduled to air on April 2, 2009 with a one-hour retrospective preceding it. [ 6 ]     History and production   In 1974, author  Michael Crichton  wrote a screenplay based on his own experiences as a medical resident in a busy ER. The screenplay went nowhere, and Crichton focused on other topics. In 1990, he published the novel  Jurassic Park , and in 1993 began a collaboration with director  Steven Spielberg  on the  film adaptation  of that. The Crichton-Spielberg team then returned to  ER  but decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film. Spielberg's  Amblin Entertainment  provided  John Wells  as the show's executive producer.   The script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in  1974 . The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 made the Dr. Lewis character a woman and the Dr. Benton character an African-American, and shortened the running time by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV. [ 7 ]   Due to a lack of time and money to build a set, the pilot episode of  ER  was filmed in the former  Linda Vista Community Hospital  in Los Angeles, an old facility that ceased operating as a medical center in 1990. [ 8 ]  A set modeled after Los Angeles County General Hospital's emergency room was built soon after at the  Warner Bros.  studios in  Burbank, California , although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city's famous  ""L""  train platforms.   ER  premiered on Monday, September 19, 1994 from 9:00-11:00 p.m. (EDT) and moved into the 10:00 p.m Thursday night timeslot three days later, where it remained for all fifteen seasons. Steven Spielberg left the show after one year in a producer's chair, but he made one critical decision with lasting effects: the Carol Hathaway character, who died at the end of the original script for the pilot episode, was retained.   ER  was filmed in 1.78:1  widescreen  from the start, even though it was not broadcast in widescreen until the seventh season when it began appearing in the  1080i  HD format where NBC was being broadcast digitally. [ citation needed ]  Since the sixth episode of Season 7, it has appeared in  letterbox  format when in standard definition. As a result, every US DVD box set shows the widescreen versions of the episodes, including those episodes originally broadcast in 1.33:1 (full screen) format. The episodes also appear in 1080i widescreen when rerun on  TNT HD , though the first six seasons still show in fullscreen on the digital  TNT  network. Only the live episode ""Ambush"" at the beginning of the fourth season, and the opening credits for the first six seasons, are in standard 4:3 aspect ratio.     Episodes       Main article:  List of ER episodes       ER  has had many memorable episodes, and is particularly notable for broadcasting a live episode, ""Ambush,"" in 1997, with the NBC camera crew disguised as a  PBS  crew making a documentary film in the hospital. The actors performed the show again three hours later so that the  West Coast  airing would be live as well. This episode received  Emmy Award  nominations for Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic), and won the Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Series.   Most episodes center on the ER, with almost all scenes at the hospital. There is, however, often at least one scene showing the goings-on of the ER staff outside the hospital. Also, there is a tradition to feature storylines each season completely outside of the ER. One early such instance involved a road trip near Las Vegas, Nevada (Drs. Ross and Greene). Season Eight included a storyline in Hawaii (Drs. Greene and Corday). More recently, the series has included storylines in Democratic Republic of Congo (Drs. Kovac and Carter) and Darfur, Sudan (Drs. Pratt and Carter, with Noah Wyle appearing as a guest star in the season following his departure from the show).     Cast     Main cast          Original cast of the show (1994-1995)       The original cast consisted of  Anthony Edwards  as Dr. Mark Greene,  George Clooney  as Dr. Doug Ross,  Sherry Stringfield  as Dr. Susan Lewis,  Noah Wyle  as John Carter, and  Eriq La Salle  as Dr. Peter Benton.  Julianna Margulies  guest starred in the pilot as Carol Hathaway before becoming part of the regular cast.   The first addition to the cast came towards the end of Season One with Jeanie Boulet ( Gloria Reuben ) joining the supporting cast and later becoming part of the main cast in Season Two.  Laura Innes  signed on to the supporting cast in Season Two as Kerry Weaver before becoming part of the main cast in Season Three. Anna Del Amico ( Maria Bello ) was introduced at the end of Season Three and then joined the main cast at the beginning of Season Four where Elizabeth Corday ( Alex Kingston ) is also introduced. Season Five began with the addition of  Kellie Martin  as Medical student Lucy Knight and Season Six opened with the addition of then-unknown Croatian actor  Goran Visnjic  to the cast as the tragic Dr. Luka Kovac and soon after,  Maura Tierney  as Abby Lockhart, who together formed the series longest running, and most complicated, romantic relationship. That season also saw the addition of  Paul McCrane  as Dr. Robert ""Rocket"" Romano to the main cast after being part of the supporting cast in both Seasons Four and Five.  Michael Michele  as Dr. Cleo Finch and  Erik Palladino  as Dr. Dave Malucci also joined the cast that season and finally,  Ming-Na  returned to reprise a character she had created as a supporting actress in Season One, Jing-Mei ""Deb"" Chen. Season Eight saw the addition of  Sharif Atkins  as Michael Gallant.  Mekhi Phifer  originated the character of Dr. Greg Pratt in Season Eight and joined the main cast in Season Nine. Season Ten saw the addition of  Parminder Nagra  as Dr. Neela Rasgotra and  Linda Cardellini  as Nurse Samantha Taggart.  Scott Grimes  joined the supporting cast in Season Ten as Dr. Archie Morris and became part of the main cast in Season Twelve;  Shane West  joined the cast in Season Eleven as Dr. Ray Barnett. Season Thirteen saw the addition of  John Stamos  as Dr. Tony Gates, reprising a role he originated in Season Twelve as an Emergency Medical Technician. Season Fourteen saw the introduction of supporting actor  David Lyons  as Dr. Simon Brenner; Lyons would join the main cast in Season Fifteen, along with  Angela Bassett  as Dr. Cate Banfield.

Wyle was previously billed as a guest star for a four-episode appearance in Season 12. [ 9 ]   Note 2 :  Although Edwards was billed with the regular cast in Episode 316, his was a single-episode reprise of role he left at the end of Season 8. [ 10 ]     Departures from the main cast   Sherry Stringfield 's first departure on the show was in 1996, when her character,  Susan Lewis , moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in the Season 3 episode ""Union Station."" In 2001, Stringfield returned to the series, reprising her role of Dr. Lewis, in the Season 8 episode ""Never Say Never."" She departed again in the Season 12 premiere, ""Canon City."" This second departure was not depicted, but rather mentioned by character  Kerry Weaver  four episodes later in ""Wake Up,"" when she explains that Susan had accepted a tenure-track position at a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa, after having been denied tenure at County.   After playing  Anna Del Amico  for one season,  Maria Bello  was not a part of the ensemble cast when Season 5 began. Like  Susan Lewis 's second exit, her character's departure was mentioned but not depicted; in the season premiere, ""Day for Knight,""  Carter  explains to new medical student  Lucy Knight  that the locker she is inheriting used to belong to Anna Del Amico, who is working in a pediatric ER back in Philadelphia, where she has family and a boyfriend.   George Clooney  left the show in 1999, in the Season 5 episode ""The Storm, Part 2,"" when his character,  Doug Ross , quit before being fired by County for his involvement in a patient's death. Clooney returned in the season 6 episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow"" in a cameo when his character reunited with  Carol Hathaway .   Gloria Reuben  departed early in Season 6, in the episode ""The Peace of Wild Things,"" when her character,  Jeanie Boulet , decided to become a stay-at-home mom and care for her newly adopted HIV-positive baby. Reuben returned in the season 14 episode ""Status Quo"" with her HIV positive child.   Kellie Martin , who played medical student  Lucy Knight , left the series midway through Season 6 in the episode ""All In The Family,"" when her character was killed by a patient suffering from undiagnosed  schizophrenia ; his  psychotic break  occurred before a backed-up psychiatry department could arrive in the ER for a consult.   Julianna Margulies  left the show at the end of Season 6, in the episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow,"" when her character,  Carol Hathaway , decided on the spur of the moment to go to Seattle, Washington, and reunite with  Doug Ross , her true love and the father of her twin daughters.   Erik Palladino  departed early in Season 8, in the episode (""Never Say Never"") after his character,  Dave Malucci , was fired for inappropriate conduct.   Eriq La Salle 's character,  Peter Benton , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". He took a job with a set schedule at another hospital in order to spend more time with his son, Reese, and his girlfriend, former fellow ER doctor  Cleo Finch . La Salle returned in the season 8 episodes ""It's All in Your Head"" in a cameo to speak with Elizabeth Corday and ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Michael Michele 's character,  Cleo Finch , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" with her boyfriend, and fellow doctor,  Peter Benton , after having previously taken a job at the same hospital with set schedules (in fact it was she who arranged the interview which resulted in Benton's job offer). Michele returned in the season 8 episode ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Anthony Edwards 's character,  Mark Greene , died of a brain tumor in Season 8's penultimate episode, ""On the Beach."" Unusually, Anthony Edwards was credited in the following episode ""Lockdown"". Edwards returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" where he appeared in multiple flashback scenes to give insight into the past of Angela Bassett's character. [ 11 ]   Paul McCrane 's character,  Robert Romano , whose arm had been severed just above the elbow by a helicopter's tail rotor in the Season 9 premiere ""Chaos Theory,"" was killed in the Season 10 episode ""Freefall"" when a helicopter that was taking off from the hospital roof was buffeted by strong winds, causing it to crash on the roof and plummet over the side of the building; it fell into a crowded ambulance bay and landed squarely on Romano. McCrane returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Sharif Atkins  left the series in the Season 10 episode ""Where There's Smoke,"" when his character,  Michael Gallant , revealed that the Army was sending him to Iraq. Atkins returned in the Season 11 episodes ""Here and There"" and ""Back in the World"" in several scenes taking place in Iraq and then again in the season 12 episodes ""Two Ships,"" ""I Do,"" ""Split Decisions,"" and ""The Gallant Hero and The Tragic Victor"" where he married Neela and then returned to Iraq where he was killed by an  improvised explosive device  while serving a second tour there.   Alex Kingston 's character,  Elizabeth Corday , left the series in the Season 11 episode ""Fear"" after getting in trouble for performing an illegal organ donation procedure; rather than being summarily fired, County offered her a demotion to a non-tenured position, but she turned it down and opted to return to England instead. In an interview with Britain's  Radio Times  magazine, Kingston spoke of being written off the show due to her age, a statement that sparked some controversy. She later withdrew that claim. [ 12 ]  Kingston returned in the 15th season episode ""Dream Runner"" in two of Neela's dream sequences. [ 13 ]   Ming-Na  left in Season 11 as an attending physician when her character,  Jing-Mei Chen , resigned in in order to take care of her ailing father, whom she later  euthanized  in the episode ""Twas the Night."" This was the second time her character left County General; in season 1, medical student ""Deb"" Chen recurred in an eight episode story arc which concluded with her leaving medical school after accidentally leaving a guide wire in a patient's chest and deciding she was better suited to do research than to do applied medicine.   Noah Wyle  left in the Season 11 finale, ""The Show Must Go On."" His character,  John Carter , after having received tenure at County, decided to reunite with his girlfriend  Kem Likasu  (portrayed by  Thandie Newton ). Wyle returned in the season 12 episodes ""Quintessence of Dust,"" ""Darfur,"" ""No Place to Hide,"" and ""There Are No Angels Here"" where he is practicing medicine in Darfur and then again in the 15th season episode ""The Beginning of the End,"" the first of five episodes he'll return for.   Laura Innes  left midway through Season 13, in the episode ""A House Divided,"" when a reluctant  Luka Kova  was forced by budget cuts to fire her character,  Kerry Weaver . After bracing for a battle to keep her position, and in spite of the fact that Kova realized he must find a way to keep her on staff, Weaver ultimately decided to resign from County and accept a job offer from a television station in Miami, Florida. Innes returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Shane West  left at the end of the 13th season after his character,  Ray Barnett  lost both his legs and returned to Baton Rouge with his mother to recuperate. West's final appearance as a main cast member was in ""The Honeymoon is Over."" West returned in the 15th season episode ""Haunted"" to visit Neela and the rest of the staff.   Mekhi Phifer  departed during the first episode of Season 15. His character,  Gregory Pratt , died in the ER as the result of blast injuries suffered in an ambulance explosion in the final episode of Season 14.   Goran Visnjic  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with his TV wife Abby Lockhart. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  Luka had previously left the show in the season finale of season 13 when he left for Croatia to care for his ailing father. He returned for seven episodes in season 14 to wrap up his medical storyline and then made a brief appearance in ""Book of Abby"" where he, Abby, and their son Joe embark on their new life together.   Maura Tierney  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with her TV husband Luka Kovac. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  She attempted to leave the ER quietly, however the rest of the staff made it known how much they will miss her. Nurse Haleh Adams showed Abby a hidden wall with the locker labels of all the past staff members since season one, with the exception of Carter who refused to deface government property (the other names on the wall were mostly departed former characters as well as some prominent writers and producers). Abby then left the ER and met Luka and her son Joe outside where they embark on their new life together.

[ 1 ]  It premiered on September 19, 1994 and has been aired on Thursday nights at 10:00 for its entire run. On April 2, 2008, NBC announced that the series will return for its 15th, concluding season. [ 2 ]  Originally scheduled to run for 19 episodes before retiring with a two-hour series finale to be broadcast on March 12, 2009, [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  NBC recently announced it will extend  ER  by an additional three episodes to a full 22 episode order as part of a deal to launch a new series by John Wells. [ 5 ]  ER's final episode is scheduled to air on April 2, 2009 with a one-hour retrospective preceding it. [ 6 ]     History and production   In 1974, author  Michael Crichton  wrote a screenplay based on his own experiences as a medical resident in a busy ER. The screenplay went nowhere, and Crichton focused on other topics. In 1990, he published the novel  Jurassic Park , and in 1993 began a collaboration with director  Steven Spielberg  on the  film adaptation  of that. The Crichton-Spielberg team then returned to  ER  but decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film. Spielberg's  Amblin Entertainment  provided  John Wells  as the show's executive producer.   The script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in  1974 . The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 made the Dr. Lewis character a woman and the Dr. Benton character an African-American, and shortened the running time by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV. [ 7 ]   Due to a lack of time and money to build a set, the pilot episode of  ER  was filmed in the former  Linda Vista Community Hospital  in Los Angeles, an old facility that ceased operating as a medical center in 1990. [ 8 ]  A set modeled after Los Angeles County General Hospital's emergency room was built soon after at the  Warner Bros.  studios in  Burbank, California , although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city's famous  ""L""  train platforms.   ER  premiered on Monday, September 19, 1994 from 9:00-11:00 p.m. (EDT) and moved into the 10:00 p.m Thursday night timeslot three days later, where it remained for all fifteen seasons. Steven Spielberg left the show after one year in a producer's chair, but he made one critical decision with lasting effects: the Carol Hathaway character, who died at the end of the original script for the pilot episode, was retained.   ER  was filmed in 1.78:1  widescreen  from the start, even though it was not broadcast in widescreen until the seventh season when it began appearing in the  1080i  HD format where NBC was being broadcast digitally. [ citation needed ]  Since the sixth episode of Season 7, it has appeared in  letterbox  format when in standard definition. As a result, every US DVD box set shows the widescreen versions of the episodes, including those episodes originally broadcast in 1.33:1 (full screen) format. The episodes also appear in 1080i widescreen when rerun on  TNT HD , though the first six seasons still show in fullscreen on the digital  TNT  network. Only the live episode ""Ambush"" at the beginning of the fourth season, and the opening credits for the first six seasons, are in standard 4:3 aspect ratio.     Episodes       Main article:  List of ER episodes       ER  has had many memorable episodes, and is particularly notable for broadcasting a live episode, ""Ambush,"" in 1997, with the NBC camera crew disguised as a  PBS  crew making a documentary film in the hospital. The actors performed the show again three hours later so that the  West Coast  airing would be live as well. This episode received  Emmy Award  nominations for Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic), and won the Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Series.   Most episodes center on the ER, with almost all scenes at the hospital. There is, however, often at least one scene showing the goings-on of the ER staff outside the hospital. Also, there is a tradition to feature storylines each season completely outside of the ER. One early such instance involved a road trip near Las Vegas, Nevada (Drs. Ross and Greene). Season Eight included a storyline in Hawaii (Drs. Greene and Corday). More recently, the series has included storylines in Democratic Republic of Congo (Drs. Kovac and Carter) and Darfur, Sudan (Drs. Pratt and Carter, with Noah Wyle appearing as a guest star in the season following his departure from the show).

Wyle was previously billed as a guest star for a four-episode appearance in Season 12. [ 9 ]   Note 2 :  Although Edwards was billed with the regular cast in Episode 316, his was a single-episode reprise of role he left at the end of Season 8. [ 10 ]     Departures from the main cast   Sherry Stringfield 's first departure on the show was in 1996, when her character,  Susan Lewis , moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in the Season 3 episode ""Union Station."" In 2001, Stringfield returned to the series, reprising her role of Dr. Lewis, in the Season 8 episode ""Never Say Never."" She departed again in the Season 12 premiere, ""Canon City."" This second departure was not depicted, but rather mentioned by character  Kerry Weaver  four episodes later in ""Wake Up,"" when she explains that Susan had accepted a tenure-track position at a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa, after having been denied tenure at County.   After playing  Anna Del Amico  for one season,  Maria Bello  was not a part of the ensemble cast when Season 5 began. Like  Susan Lewis 's second exit, her character's departure was mentioned but not depicted; in the season premiere, ""Day for Knight,""  Carter  explains to new medical student  Lucy Knight  that the locker she is inheriting used to belong to Anna Del Amico, who is working in a pediatric ER back in Philadelphia, where she has family and a boyfriend.   George Clooney  left the show in 1999, in the Season 5 episode ""The Storm, Part 2,"" when his character,  Doug Ross , quit before being fired by County for his involvement in a patient's death. Clooney returned in the season 6 episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow"" in a cameo when his character reunited with  Carol Hathaway .   Gloria Reuben  departed early in Season 6, in the episode ""The Peace of Wild Things,"" when her character,  Jeanie Boulet , decided to become a stay-at-home mom and care for her newly adopted HIV-positive baby. Reuben returned in the season 14 episode ""Status Quo"" with her HIV positive child.   Kellie Martin , who played medical student  Lucy Knight , left the series midway through Season 6 in the episode ""All In The Family,"" when her character was killed by a patient suffering from undiagnosed  schizophrenia ; his  psychotic break  occurred before a backed-up psychiatry department could arrive in the ER for a consult.   Julianna Margulies  left the show at the end of Season 6, in the episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow,"" when her character,  Carol Hathaway , decided on the spur of the moment to go to Seattle, Washington, and reunite with  Doug Ross , her true love and the father of her twin daughters.   Erik Palladino  departed early in Season 8, in the episode (""Never Say Never"") after his character,  Dave Malucci , was fired for inappropriate conduct.   Eriq La Salle 's character,  Peter Benton , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". He took a job with a set schedule at another hospital in order to spend more time with his son, Reese, and his girlfriend, former fellow ER doctor  Cleo Finch . La Salle returned in the season 8 episodes ""It's All in Your Head"" in a cameo to speak with Elizabeth Corday and ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Michael Michele 's character,  Cleo Finch , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" with her boyfriend, and fellow doctor,  Peter Benton , after having previously taken a job at the same hospital with set schedules (in fact it was she who arranged the interview which resulted in Benton's job offer). Michele returned in the season 8 episode ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Anthony Edwards 's character,  Mark Greene , died of a brain tumor in Season 8's penultimate episode, ""On the Beach."" Unusually, Anthony Edwards was credited in the following episode ""Lockdown"". Edwards returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" where he appeared in multiple flashback scenes to give insight into the past of Angela Bassett's character. [ 11 ]   Paul McCrane 's character,  Robert Romano , whose arm had been severed just above the elbow by a helicopter's tail rotor in the Season 9 premiere ""Chaos Theory,"" was killed in the Season 10 episode ""Freefall"" when a helicopter that was taking off from the hospital roof was buffeted by strong winds, causing it to crash on the roof and plummet over the side of the building; it fell into a crowded ambulance bay and landed squarely on Romano. McCrane returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Sharif Atkins  left the series in the Season 10 episode ""Where There's Smoke,"" when his character,  Michael Gallant , revealed that the Army was sending him to Iraq. Atkins returned in the Season 11 episodes ""Here and There"" and ""Back in the World"" in several scenes taking place in Iraq and then again in the season 12 episodes ""Two Ships,"" ""I Do,"" ""Split Decisions,"" and ""The Gallant Hero and The Tragic Victor"" where he married Neela and then returned to Iraq where he was killed by an  improvised explosive device  while serving a second tour there.   Alex Kingston 's character,  Elizabeth Corday , left the series in the Season 11 episode ""Fear"" after getting in trouble for performing an illegal organ donation procedure; rather than being summarily fired, County offered her a demotion to a non-tenured position, but she turned it down and opted to return to England instead. In an interview with Britain's  Radio Times  magazine, Kingston spoke of being written off the show due to her age, a statement that sparked some controversy. She later withdrew that claim. [ 12 ]  Kingston returned in the 15th season episode ""Dream Runner"" in two of Neela's dream sequences. [ 13 ]   Ming-Na  left in Season 11 as an attending physician when her character,  Jing-Mei Chen , resigned in in order to take care of her ailing father, whom she later  euthanized  in the episode ""Twas the Night."" This was the second time her character left County General; in season 1, medical student ""Deb"" Chen recurred in an eight episode story arc which concluded with her leaving medical school after accidentally leaving a guide wire in a patient's chest and deciding she was better suited to do research than to do applied medicine.   Noah Wyle  left in the Season 11 finale, ""The Show Must Go On."" His character,  John Carter , after having received tenure at County, decided to reunite with his girlfriend  Kem Likasu  (portrayed by  Thandie Newton ). Wyle returned in the season 12 episodes ""Quintessence of Dust,"" ""Darfur,"" ""No Place to Hide,"" and ""There Are No Angels Here"" where he is practicing medicine in Darfur and then again in the 15th season episode ""The Beginning of the End,"" the first of five episodes he'll return for.   Laura Innes  left midway through Season 13, in the episode ""A House Divided,"" when a reluctant  Luka Kova  was forced by budget cuts to fire her character,  Kerry Weaver . After bracing for a battle to keep her position, and in spite of the fact that Kova realized he must find a way to keep her on staff, Weaver ultimately decided to resign from County and accept a job offer from a television station in Miami, Florida. Innes returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Shane West  left at the end of the 13th season after his character,  Ray Barnett  lost both his legs and returned to Baton Rouge with his mother to recuperate. West's final appearance as a main cast member was in ""The Honeymoon is Over."" West returned in the 15th season episode ""Haunted"" to visit Neela and the rest of the staff.   Mekhi Phifer  departed during the first episode of Season 15. His character,  Gregory Pratt , died in the ER as the result of blast injuries suffered in an ambulance explosion in the final episode of Season 14.   Goran Visnjic  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with his TV wife Abby Lockhart. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  Luka had previously left the show in the season finale of season 13 when he left for Croatia to care for his ailing father. He returned for seven episodes in season 14 to wrap up his medical storyline and then made a brief appearance in ""Book of Abby"" where he, Abby, and their son Joe embark on their new life together.   Maura Tierney  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with her TV husband Luka Kovac. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  She attempted to leave the ER quietly, however the rest of the staff made it known how much they will miss her. Nurse Haleh Adams showed Abby a hidden wall with the locker labels of all the past staff members since season one, with the exception of Carter who refused to deface government property (the other names on the wall were mostly departed former characters as well as some prominent writers and producers). Abby then left the ER and met Luka and her son Joe outside where they embark on their new life together.

Orphaned by an outbreak of  cholera , she is sent back to England to the legal guardianship of her only remaining relative: her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a reclusive widower.   Craven still mourns the death of his beautiful young wife, Lilias, from ten years ago. To escape his sad memories, he constantly travels abroad, leaving Mary and the  manor  under the supervision of his  housekeeper , Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   After Mary finds the key to the secret garden, a  robin  shows her where the door is hidden by overgrown ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle visits the house briefly for the first time since she arrived, Mary asks him for a bit of earth to make a flower garden, and he agrees. Thanks to the invigorating Yorkshire air and her new-found fascination with the garden, Mary herself begins to blossom, and loses her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   On several occasions, Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive; they tell her that she is hearing things, or blame the sound on ordinary sources such as the wind or a servant with a toothache. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and both he and Colin are morbidly convinced that the boy will develop the same condition. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums. Colin, however, accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often.   As spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous because Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon than indoors with him. One day he voices his resentment and, when Mary resists, he throws a tantrum. To the surprise and amusement of the servants, Mary continues to stand her ground. That evening, Colin has a  hysterical  fit, brought on by his fear of dying young. Mary goes to him and, again taking a firm, no-nonsense stance with him, slaps him in the face to shock him out of his hysteria; to the servants' surprise, when Mary screams back at him, he doesn't object.   When Colin asks if he can visit the garden with her, she agrees, as she and Dickon had been planning to suggest it themselves, feeling that it would do Colin good. Colin's doctor, who is Mr. Craven's cousin, agrees to let Dickon and Mary take Colin outside in a wheelchair. To maintain their secret, Colin orders everyone else to stay out of the gardens on those occasions. Colin is delighted with his mother's garden, and visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows. As the garden revives and flourishes, so does he.   The first adult to discover what the children are doing is the old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, who was a favorite of Colin's mother. After her death, he visited the locked garden once or twice a year by secretly scaling the wall with a ladder. When he visits the garden for the first time since Mary's arrival (having had to miss several visits because of  rheumatism ), he is angry with the children until he sees how improved both the garden and Colin are. Colin orders him not to tell anybody, and he agrees. Colin resolves that the next time his father returns from abroad he will be able to walk and run like a normal boy. He accomplishes this through a combination of simple physical exercise taught by Dickon and positive thinking. He refuses to think of himself as crippled, and he invents a kind of  mantra  to keep himself in the right, or ""magic,"" frame of mind. He makes great progress, but keeps it hidden from everyone but Mary, Dickon, and Ben, wanting it to be a surprise.   Mr. Craven has been traveling throughout Europe, but is inspired to rush home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream and receiving a letter from Mrs. Sowerby (Martha's and Dickon's mother, who also knows the secret) telling him, ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here"". He arrives while the children are outdoors. He goes out to see Colin for himself, and finds himself drawn to the secret garden, where he is astonished to hear children's voices and then to find Colin not only racing Mary and Dickon around the garden, but winning. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. Afterwards they walk back to the house, where the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.     [ edit ]   Major themes   The author, Frances Hodgson Burnett, was a practitioner of  Christian Science  due to the premature death of her son as well as personal illness. [ 2 ]  As a result,  The Secret Garden  espouses the concepts of  New Thought  and  theosophy  as well as ideas about the healing powers of the mind. [ 3 ]   The garden is the book's central symbol. The secret garden at Misselthwaite Manner is the site of both the near-destruction and the subsequent regeneration of a family  [ 4 ]  Using the garden motif, Burnett explores the healing power inherent in living things.   Maytham Hall in  Kent, England , where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage to Stephen Townesend, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.  [ 5 ]  Burnett kept an extensive garden, including an impressive rose garden. However, it has been noted that besides the garden, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Publication History & Popularity   The Secret Garden first appeared to the public in serial format aimed at adults in 1910, one year prior to its release in book format. Marketing to both adult and juvenile audiences may have had an effect on its early reception; the book was not as celebrated as Burnett's previous works during her lifetime.  [ 7 ]   The Secret Garden paled in comparison to the popularity of Burnett's other works for a long period. Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Anne H. Lundin noted [ 8 ]  that the author's obituary notices all remarked on  Little Lord Fauntleroy  and passed over  The Secret Garden  in silence.   With the rise of scholarly work in children's literature over the past quarter century, The Secret Garden has steadily risen to prominence, and is now arguably Burnett's best known work. The book is often noted as one of the best children's books of the twentieth century  [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Dramatic adaptations   The Secret Garden  has been adapted many times for other media.     [ edit ]   Live-action     [ edit ]   Films   The first filmed version was made in 1919 by the  Famous Players-Lasky Corporation  with 17 year old  Lila Lee  as Mary and  Paul Willis  as Dickon, but the film is considered lost.   In 1949,  MGM  filmed  the second adaptation  with  Margaret O'Brien . This version was mostly in black-and-white, but the sequences set in the restored garden were filmed in  Technicolor .   The most acclaimed film adaptation is  American Zoetrope 's  1993 production . It was directed by  Agnieszka Holland  and starred  Kate Maberly  as Mary,  Heydon Prowse  as Colin,  Andrew Knott  as Dickon and  Dame Maggie Smith  as Mrs. Medlock.     [ edit ]   Television   Dorothea Brooking  adapted the book into several different television serials for the BBC: an eight-part serial in 1952, a six-part serial in 1960 (starring  Colin Spaull  as Dickon), and a three-part serial in 1975.   In 1987,  Hallmark Hall of Fame  filmed a TV adaptation of the novel starring  Gennie James  as Mary,  Barret Oliver  as Dickon, and  Jadrien Steele  as Colin.  Derek Jacobi  plays the role of Archibald Craven, with  Alison Doody  appearing in flashbacks and visions as Lilias; a young  Colin Firth  also makes a brief appearance as the adult Colin Craven.     [ edit ]   Stage   Stage adaptations of the book have also been created.  One notable adaptation  is a  musical  with music by  Lucy Simon  and book and lyrics by  Marsha Norman , which opened on  Broadway  in 1991. The production was nominated for seven  Tony Awards , winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Daisy Eagan  as Mary, at eleven years old is the youngest person ever to win a Tony).   In 2007 the  Orlando Shakespeare Theater  commissioned April-Dawn Gladu to create an adaptation for their Theater For Young Audiences series. This version's unique qualities include an actress silently playing The Garden Tree, which was the tree that Lilias fell from years ago. As the children work secretly in the garden to bring it to life, the living tree wakes up, flourishes and blooms. [ 10 ]   Oakland Ballet has produced  The Secret Garden  set to music by Sir Edward Elgar. [ 11 ]   The Secret Garden  has also been made into an opera by Clover Loehr & Conan McLemore, and will be presented by Northwest Children's Opera in June of 2009.     [ edit ]   Animation   In 1991, a  Japanese animated  version of  The Secret Garden  was made, entitled  Himitsu no Hanazono . [ 12 ]   As part of the ""ABC Weekend Special"" series, another animated version was made in 1995, with  Derek Jacobi  as the voice of Archibald Craven.   Another anime movie,  Sk no Strain  (2006), based on another Frances Hodgson Burnett novel,  A Little Princess , draws some elements from  The Secret Garden , mostly the names of Colin, Mary, Martha and Dickon. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Sequels     [ edit ]   Written works   Noel Streatfeild 's 1949 novel  The Painted Garden  (U.S. title  Movie Shoes ) has as its central story the filming of  The Secret Garden  in Hollywood. A novel about the adult lives of Mary, Colin, and Dickon was written by  Susan Moody  in 1995 and published under two different titles:  Misselthwaite: The Sequel to the Secret Garden  and  Return to the Secret Garden . The  New York Times  also published a brief parodic sequel [ 14 ]  in 1995. A different sequel novel,  Till All the Seas Run Dry , was written by Susan Webb and published in 1998.     [ edit ]   Dramatic media   A 2000 sequel entitled  Return to the Secret Garden  was directed by  Scott Featherstone  and won the Director's Gold Award at the 2001 Santa Clarita International Film Festival. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   In 2001, the  TV movie   Back to the Secret Garden , directed by Michael Tuchner, shows Mary and Colin as married adults who have made Craven Manor into a shelter for orphans. It starred  Joan Plowright  as Martha and  George Baker  as Will Weatherstaff (a younger relative of Ben Weatherstaff), with  Camilla Belle  as an American orphan, Lizzie.

Howard came to prominence in the 1960s while playing  Andy Griffith 's TV son,  Opie Taylor , on  The Andy Griffith Show  (credited as Ronny Howard), and later in the 1970s as Howard Cunningham's son and  Arthur Fonzarelli 's best friend,  Richie Cunningham , on  Happy Days  (a role he played from 1974 to 1980). Since retiring from acting, he has directed many films including  Apollo 13 ,  A Beautiful Mind ,  Frost/Nixon , and the upcoming sequel to the  The Da Vinci Code ,  Angels and Demons .

[ 1 ]  His family later moved to  Burbank, California , just the year before his parents gave birth to his younger brother,  Clint Howard . Howard graduated from  John Burroughs High School , and later attended the  University of Southern California 's  School of Cinematic Arts  but did not graduate. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Career     [ edit ]   Early acting roles and  The Andy Griffith Show   Howard first earned recognition for playing Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp in the film version of  The Music Man  with  Robert Preston  and  Shirley Jones . Besides appearing in  The Music Man , he appeared in the role of  Opie Taylor  in the television series  The Andy Griffith Show , which was the successful spin-off of  The Danny Thomas Show . There he portrayed the son of the local sheriff in the fictional town of  Mayberry ,  North Carolina . For eight seasons, he created a loving relationship with  Andy Griffith  on-screen, and spent a lot of time with him off-screen when not filming. The credits referred to him as ""Ronny Howard."" He also appeared in the 1963 film  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  with  Glenn Ford  and (billed as ""Ronnie Howard"") in  Little Boy Lost , a 1963 episode of the  NBC   medical drama   The Eleventh Hour  as the character Barry Stewart in the episode entitled ""Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?"", and a 1966 episode of the NBC  adventure  series  I Spy  with  Robert Culp  and  Bill Cosby .   Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.   On a  VH1  special about the 100 greatest  Child Stars , many of the interviewees considered Ron Howard to be the most successful child star of all-time, considering his two major television acting roles and his directing career. [ citation needed ]  In Season 1, Episode 3 of  Stroker and Hoop  on  Adult Swim , Stroker and Hoop ran a detective agency whose first client needed them to make Ron Howard stop controlling his mind.   In October 2008, Howard reprised his roles as Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham for the first time in over 20 years when he appeared in a video on  funnyordie.com  in which he endorsed Barack Obama and urged people to vote. The video, titled  ""Ron Howards Call to Action"" , [ 6 ] also features  Andy Griffith  and  Henry Winkler . As seen in the video, Howard is seen shaving his beard and having hair done to recreate his younger look.

It is set primarily in the  emergency room  of fictional County General Hospital in  Chicago ,  Illinois .

[ 1 ]  It premiered on September 19, 1994 and has been aired on Thursday nights at 10:00 for its entire run. On April 2, 2008, NBC announced that the series will return for its 15th, concluding season. [ 2 ]  Originally scheduled to run for 19 episodes before retiring with a two-hour series finale to be broadcast on March 12, 2009, [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  NBC recently announced it will extend  ER  by an additional three episodes to a full 22 episode order as part of a deal to launch a new series by John Wells. [ 5 ]  ER's final episode is scheduled to air on April 2, 2009 with a one-hour retrospective preceding it. [ 6 ]     History and production   In 1974, author  Michael Crichton  wrote a screenplay based on his own experiences as a medical resident in a busy ER. The screenplay went nowhere, and Crichton focused on other topics. In 1990, he published the novel  Jurassic Park , and in 1993 began a collaboration with director  Steven Spielberg  on the  film adaptation  of that. The Crichton-Spielberg team then returned to  ER  but decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film. Spielberg's  Amblin Entertainment  provided  John Wells  as the show's executive producer.   The script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in  1974 . The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 made the Dr. Lewis character a woman and the Dr. Benton character an African-American, and shortened the running time by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV. [ 7 ]   Due to a lack of time and money to build a set, the pilot episode of  ER  was filmed in the former  Linda Vista Community Hospital  in Los Angeles, an old facility that ceased operating as a medical center in 1990. [ 8 ]  A set modeled after Los Angeles County General Hospital's emergency room was built soon after at the  Warner Bros.  studios in  Burbank, California , although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city's famous  ""L""  train platforms.   ER  premiered on Monday, September 19, 1994 from 9:00-11:00 p.m. (EDT) and moved into the 10:00 p.m Thursday night timeslot three days later, where it remained for all fifteen seasons. Steven Spielberg left the show after one year in a producer's chair, but he made one critical decision with lasting effects: the Carol Hathaway character, who died at the end of the original script for the pilot episode, was retained.   ER  was filmed in 1.78:1  widescreen  from the start, even though it was not broadcast in widescreen until the seventh season when it began appearing in the  1080i  HD format where NBC was being broadcast digitally. [ citation needed ]  Since the sixth episode of Season 7, it has appeared in  letterbox  format when in standard definition. As a result, every US DVD box set shows the widescreen versions of the episodes, including those episodes originally broadcast in 1.33:1 (full screen) format. The episodes also appear in 1080i widescreen when rerun on  TNT HD , though the first six seasons still show in fullscreen on the digital  TNT  network. Only the live episode ""Ambush"" at the beginning of the fourth season, and the opening credits for the first six seasons, are in standard 4:3 aspect ratio.     Episodes       Main article:  List of ER episodes       ER  has had many memorable episodes, and is particularly notable for broadcasting a live episode, ""Ambush,"" in 1997, with the NBC camera crew disguised as a  PBS  crew making a documentary film in the hospital. The actors performed the show again three hours later so that the  West Coast  airing would be live as well. This episode received  Emmy Award  nominations for Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic), and won the Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Series.   Most episodes center on the ER, with almost all scenes at the hospital. There is, however, often at least one scene showing the goings-on of the ER staff outside the hospital. Also, there is a tradition to feature storylines each season completely outside of the ER. One early such instance involved a road trip near Las Vegas, Nevada (Drs. Ross and Greene). Season Eight included a storyline in Hawaii (Drs. Greene and Corday). More recently, the series has included storylines in Democratic Republic of Congo (Drs. Kovac and Carter) and Darfur, Sudan (Drs. Pratt and Carter, with Noah Wyle appearing as a guest star in the season following his departure from the show).     Cast     Main cast          Original cast of the show (1994-1995)       The original cast consisted of  Anthony Edwards  as Dr. Mark Greene,  George Clooney  as Dr. Doug Ross,  Sherry Stringfield  as Dr. Susan Lewis,  Noah Wyle  as John Carter, and  Eriq La Salle  as Dr. Peter Benton.  Julianna Margulies  guest starred in the pilot as Carol Hathaway before becoming part of the regular cast.   The first addition to the cast came towards the end of Season One with Jeanie Boulet ( Gloria Reuben ) joining the supporting cast and later becoming part of the main cast in Season Two.  Laura Innes  signed on to the supporting cast in Season Two as Kerry Weaver before becoming part of the main cast in Season Three. Anna Del Amico ( Maria Bello ) was introduced at the end of Season Three and then joined the main cast at the beginning of Season Four where Elizabeth Corday ( Alex Kingston ) is also introduced. Season Five began with the addition of  Kellie Martin  as Medical student Lucy Knight and Season Six opened with the addition of then-unknown Croatian actor  Goran Visnjic  to the cast as the tragic Dr. Luka Kovac and soon after,  Maura Tierney  as Abby Lockhart, who together formed the series longest running, and most complicated, romantic relationship. That season also saw the addition of  Paul McCrane  as Dr. Robert ""Rocket"" Romano to the main cast after being part of the supporting cast in both Seasons Four and Five.  Michael Michele  as Dr. Cleo Finch and  Erik Palladino  as Dr. Dave Malucci also joined the cast that season and finally,  Ming-Na  returned to reprise a character she had created as a supporting actress in Season One, Jing-Mei ""Deb"" Chen. Season Eight saw the addition of  Sharif Atkins  as Michael Gallant.  Mekhi Phifer  originated the character of Dr. Greg Pratt in Season Eight and joined the main cast in Season Nine. Season Ten saw the addition of  Parminder Nagra  as Dr. Neela Rasgotra and  Linda Cardellini  as Nurse Samantha Taggart.  Scott Grimes  joined the supporting cast in Season Ten as Dr. Archie Morris and became part of the main cast in Season Twelve;  Shane West  joined the cast in Season Eleven as Dr. Ray Barnett. Season Thirteen saw the addition of  John Stamos  as Dr. Tony Gates, reprising a role he originated in Season Twelve as an Emergency Medical Technician. Season Fourteen saw the introduction of supporting actor  David Lyons  as Dr. Simon Brenner; Lyons would join the main cast in Season Fifteen, along with  Angela Bassett  as Dr. Cate Banfield.

Wyle was previously billed as a guest star for a four-episode appearance in Season 12. [ 9 ]   Note 2 :  Although Edwards was billed with the regular cast in Episode 316, his was a single-episode reprise of role he left at the end of Season 8. [ 10 ]     Departures from the main cast   Sherry Stringfield 's first departure on the show was in 1996, when her character,  Susan Lewis , moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in the Season 3 episode ""Union Station."" In 2001, Stringfield returned to the series, reprising her role of Dr. Lewis, in the Season 8 episode ""Never Say Never."" She departed again in the Season 12 premiere, ""Canon City."" This second departure was not depicted, but rather mentioned by character  Kerry Weaver  four episodes later in ""Wake Up,"" when she explains that Susan had accepted a tenure-track position at a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa, after having been denied tenure at County.   After playing  Anna Del Amico  for one season,  Maria Bello  was not a part of the ensemble cast when Season 5 began. Like  Susan Lewis 's second exit, her character's departure was mentioned but not depicted; in the season premiere, ""Day for Knight,""  Carter  explains to new medical student  Lucy Knight  that the locker she is inheriting used to belong to Anna Del Amico, who is working in a pediatric ER back in Philadelphia, where she has family and a boyfriend.   George Clooney  left the show in 1999, in the Season 5 episode ""The Storm, Part 2,"" when his character,  Doug Ross , quit before being fired by County for his involvement in a patient's death. Clooney returned in the season 6 episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow"" in a cameo when his character reunited with  Carol Hathaway .   Gloria Reuben  departed early in Season 6, in the episode ""The Peace of Wild Things,"" when her character,  Jeanie Boulet , decided to become a stay-at-home mom and care for her newly adopted HIV-positive baby. Reuben returned in the season 14 episode ""Status Quo"" with her HIV positive child.          Cast of the fifteenth and final season (2008-2009)       Kellie Martin , who played medical student  Lucy Knight , left the series midway through Season 6 in the episode ""All In The Family,"" when her character was killed by a patient suffering from undiagnosed  schizophrenia ; his  psychotic break  occurred before a backed-up psychiatry department could arrive in the ER for a consult.   Julianna Margulies  left the show at the end of Season 6, in the episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow,"" when her character,  Carol Hathaway , decided on the spur of the moment to go to Seattle, Washington, and reunite with  Doug Ross , her true love and the father of her twin daughters.   Erik Palladino  departed early in Season 8, in the episode (""Never Say Never"") after his character,  Dave Malucci , was fired for inappropriate conduct.   Eriq La Salle 's character,  Peter Benton , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". He took a job with a set schedule at another hospital in order to spend more time with his son, Reese, and his girlfriend, former fellow ER doctor  Cleo Finch . La Salle returned in the season 8 episodes ""It's All in Your Head"" in a cameo to speak with Elizabeth Corday and ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Michael Michele 's character,  Cleo Finch , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" with her boyfriend, and fellow doctor,  Peter Benton , after having previously taken a job at the same hospital with set schedules (in fact it was she who arranged the interview which resulted in Benton's job offer). Michele returned in the season 8 episode ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Anthony Edwards 's character,  Mark Greene , died of a brain tumor in Season 8's penultimate episode, ""On the Beach."" Unusually, Anthony Edwards was credited in the following episode ""Lockdown"". Edwards returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" where he appeared in multiple flashback scenes to give insight into the past of Angela Bassett's character. [ 11 ]   Paul McCrane 's character,  Robert Romano , whose arm had been severed just above the elbow by a helicopter's tail rotor in the Season 9 premiere ""Chaos Theory,"" was killed in the Season 10 episode ""Freefall"" when a helicopter that was taking off from the hospital roof was buffeted by strong winds, causing it to crash on the roof and plummet over the side of the building; it fell into a crowded ambulance bay and landed squarely on Romano. McCrane returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Sharif Atkins  left the series in the Season 10 episode ""Where There's Smoke,"" when his character,  Michael Gallant , revealed that the Army was sending him to Iraq. Atkins returned in the Season 11 episodes ""Here and There"" and ""Back in the World"" in several scenes taking place in Iraq and then again in the season 12 episodes ""Two Ships,"" ""I Do,"" ""Split Decisions,"" and ""The Gallant Hero and The Tragic Victor"" where he married Neela and then returned to Iraq where he was killed by an  improvised explosive device  while serving a second tour there.   Alex Kingston 's character,  Elizabeth Corday , left the series in the Season 11 episode ""Fear"" after getting in trouble for performing an illegal organ donation procedure; rather than being summarily fired, County offered her a demotion to a non-tenured position, but she turned it down and opted to return to England instead. In an interview with Britain's  Radio Times  magazine, Kingston spoke of being written off the show due to her age, a statement that sparked some controversy. She later withdrew that claim. [ 12 ]  Kingston returned in the 15th season episode ""Dream Runner"" in two of Neela's dream sequences. [ 13 ]   Ming-Na  left in Season 11 as an attending physician when her character,  Jing-Mei Chen , resigned in in order to take care of her ailing father, whom she later  euthanized  in the episode ""Twas the Night."" This was the second time her character left County General; in season 1, medical student ""Deb"" Chen recurred in an eight episode story arc which concluded with her leaving medical school after accidentally leaving a guide wire in a patient's chest and deciding she was better suited to do research than to do applied medicine.   Noah Wyle  left in the Season 11 finale, ""The Show Must Go On."" His character,  John Carter , after having received tenure at County, decided to reunite with his girlfriend  Kem Likasu  (portrayed by  Thandie Newton ). Wyle returned in the season 12 episodes ""Quintessence of Dust,"" ""Darfur,"" ""No Place to Hide,"" and ""There Are No Angels Here"" where he is practicing medicine in Darfur and then again in the 15th season episodes ""The Beginning of the End"" and ""T-Minus-6,"" two of five episodes he'll return for.   Laura Innes  left midway through Season 13, in the episode ""A House Divided,"" when a reluctant  Luka Kova  was forced by budget cuts to fire her character,  Kerry Weaver . After bracing for a battle to keep her position, and in spite of the fact that Kova realized he must find a way to keep her on staff, Weaver ultimately decided to resign from County and accept a job offer from a television station in Miami, Florida. Innes returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Shane West  left at the end of the 13th season after his character,  Ray Barnett  lost both his legs and returned to Baton Rouge with his mother to recuperate. West's final appearance as a main cast member was in ""The Honeymoon is Over."" West returned in the 15th season episode ""Haunted"" to visit Neela and the rest of the staff.   Mekhi Phifer  departed during the first episode of Season 15. His character,  Gregory Pratt , died in the ER as the result of blast injuries suffered in an ambulance explosion in the final episode of Season 14.   Goran Visnjic  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with his TV wife Abby Lockhart. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  Luka had previously left the show in the season finale of season 13 when he left for Croatia to care for his ailing father. He returned for seven episodes in season 14 to wrap up his medical storyline and then made a brief appearance in ""Book of Abby"" where he, Abby, and their son Joe embark on their new life together.   Maura Tierney  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with her TV husband Luka Kovac. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  She attempted to leave the ER quietly, however the rest of the staff made it known how much they will miss her. Nurse Haleh Adams showed Abby a hidden wall with the locker labels of all the past staff members since season one, with the exception of Carter who refused to deface government property (the other names on the wall were mostly departed former characters as well as some prominent writers and producers). Abby then left the ER and met Luka and her son Joe outside where they embark on their new life together.

The Secret Garden  is a  novel  by  Frances Hodgson Burnett , first published in  1911 . Its working title was  Mistress Mary , in reference to the English nursery rhyme  Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary . It is one of Burnett's most popular novels, and is now considered a classic of children's literature.

Orphaned by an outbreak of  cholera , she is sent back to England to the legal guardianship of her only remaining relative: her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a reclusive widower.   Craven still mourns the death of his beautiful young wife, Lilias, from ten years ago. To escape his sad memories, he constantly travels abroad, leaving Mary and the  manor  under the supervision of his  housekeeper , Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   After Mary finds the key to the secret garden, a  robin  shows her where the door is hidden by overgrown ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle visits the house briefly for the first time since she arrived, Mary asks him for a bit of earth to make a flower garden, and he agrees. Thanks to the invigorating Yorkshire air and her new-found fascination with the garden, Mary herself begins to blossom, and loses her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   On several occasions, Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive; they tell her that she is hearing things, or blame the sound on ordinary sources such as the wind or a servant with a toothache. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and both he and Colin are morbidly convinced that the boy will develop the same condition. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums. Colin, however, accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often.   As spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous because Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon than indoors with him. One day he voices his resentment and, when Mary resists, he throws a tantrum. To the surprise and amusement of the servants, Mary continues to stand her ground. That evening, Colin has a  hysterical  fit, brought on by his fear of dying young. Mary goes to him and, again taking a firm, no-nonsense stance with him, slaps him in the face to shock him out of his hysteria; to the servants' surprise, when Mary screams back at him, he doesn't object.   When Colin asks if he can visit the garden with her, she agrees, as she and Dickon had been planning to suggest it themselves, feeling that it would do Colin good. Colin's doctor, who is Mr. Craven's cousin, agrees to let Dickon and Mary take Colin outside in a wheelchair. To maintain their secret, Colin orders everyone else to stay out of the gardens on those occasions. Colin is delighted with his mother's garden, and visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows. As the garden revives and flourishes, so does he.   The first adult to discover what the children are doing is the old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, who was a favorite of Colin's mother. After her death, he visited the locked garden once or twice a year by secretly scaling the wall with a ladder. When he visits the garden for the first time since Mary's arrival (having had to miss several visits because of  rheumatism ), he is angry with the children until he sees how improved both the garden and Colin are. Colin orders him not to tell anybody, and he agrees. Colin resolves that the next time his father returns from abroad he will be able to walk and run like a normal boy. He accomplishes this through a combination of simple physical exercise taught by Dickon and positive thinking. He refuses to think of himself as crippled, and he invents a kind of  mantra  to keep himself in the right, or ""magic,"" frame of mind. He makes great progress, but keeps it hidden from everyone but Mary, Dickon, and Ben, wanting it to be a surprise.   Mr. Craven has been traveling throughout Europe, but is inspired to rush home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream and receiving a letter from Mrs. Sowerby (Martha's and Dickon's mother, who also knows the secret) telling him, ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here"". He arrives while the children are outdoors. He goes out to see Colin for himself, and finds himself drawn to the secret garden, where he is astonished to hear children's voices and then to find Colin not only racing Mary and Dickon around the garden, but winning. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. Afterwards they walk back to the house, where the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.     [ edit ]   Major themes   The author, Frances Hodgson Burnett, was a practitioner of  Christian Science  due to the premature death of her son as well as personal illness. [ 2 ]  As a result,  The Secret Garden  espouses the concepts of  New Thought  and  theosophy  as well as ideas about the healing powers of the mind. [ 3 ]   The garden is the book's central symbol. The secret garden at Misselthwaite Manner is the site of both the near-destruction and the subsequent regeneration of a family  [ 4 ]  Using the garden motif, Burnett explores the healing power inherent in living things.   Maytham Hall in  Kent, England , where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage to Stephen Townesend, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.  [ 5 ]  Burnett kept an extensive garden, including an impressive rose garden. However, it has been noted that besides the garden, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Publication History & Popularity   The Secret Garden first appeared to the public in serial format aimed at adults in 1910, one year prior to its release in book format. Marketing to both adult and juvenile audiences may have had an effect on its early reception; the book was not as celebrated as Burnett's previous works during her lifetime.  [ 7 ]   The Secret Garden paled in comparison to the popularity of Burnett's other works for a long period. Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Anne H. Lundin noted [ 8 ]  that the author's obituary notices all remarked on  Little Lord Fauntleroy  and passed over  The Secret Garden  in silence.   With the rise of scholarly work in children's literature over the past quarter century, The Secret Garden has steadily risen to prominence, and is now arguably Burnett's best known work. The book is often noted as one of the best children's books of the twentieth century  [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Dramatic adaptations   The Secret Garden  has been adapted many times for other media.     [ edit ]   Live-action     [ edit ]   Films   The first filmed version was made in 1919 by the  Famous Players-Lasky Corporation  with 17 year old  Lila Lee  as Mary and  Paul Willis  as Dickon, but the film is considered lost.   In 1949,  MGM  filmed  the second adaptation  with  Margaret O'Brien . This version was mostly in black-and-white, but the sequences set in the restored garden were filmed in  Technicolor .   The most acclaimed film adaptation is  American Zoetrope 's  1993 production . It was directed by  Agnieszka Holland  and starred  Kate Maberly  as Mary,  Heydon Prowse  as Colin,  Andrew Knott  as Dickon and  Dame Maggie Smith  as Mrs. Medlock.     [ edit ]   Television   Dorothea Brooking  adapted the book into several different television serials for the BBC: an eight-part serial in 1952, a six-part serial in 1960 (starring  Colin Spaull  as Dickon), and a three-part serial in 1975.   In 1987,  Hallmark Hall of Fame  filmed a TV adaptation of the novel starring  Gennie James  as Mary,  Barret Oliver  as Dickon, and  Jadrien Steele  as Colin.  Derek Jacobi  plays the role of Archibald Craven, with  Alison Doody  appearing in flashbacks and visions as Lilias; a young  Colin Firth  also makes a brief appearance as the adult Colin Craven.     [ edit ]   Stage   Stage adaptations of the book have also been created.  One notable adaptation  is a  musical  with music by  Lucy Simon  and book and lyrics by  Marsha Norman , which opened on  Broadway  in 1991. The production was nominated for seven  Tony Awards , winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Daisy Eagan  as Mary, at eleven years old is the youngest person ever to win a Tony).   In 2007 the  Orlando Shakespeare Theater  commissioned April-Dawn Gladu to create an adaptation for their Theater For Young Audiences series. This version's unique qualities include an actress silently playing The Garden Tree, which was the tree that Lilias fell from years ago. As the children work secretly in the garden to bring it to life, the living tree wakes up, flourishes and blooms. [ 10 ]   Oakland Ballet has produced  The Secret Garden  set to music by Sir Edward Elgar. [ 11 ]   The Secret Garden  has also been made into an opera by Clover Loehr & Conan McLemore, and will be presented by Northwest Children's Opera in June of 2009.     [ edit ]   Animation   In 1991, a  Japanese animated  version of  The Secret Garden  was made, entitled  Himitsu no Hanazono . [ 12 ]   As part of the ""ABC Weekend Special"" series, another animated version was made in 1995, with  Derek Jacobi  as the voice of Archibald Craven.   Another anime movie,  Sk no Strain  (2006), based on another Frances Hodgson Burnett novel,  A Little Princess , draws some elements from  The Secret Garden , mostly the names of Colin, Mary, Martha and Dickon. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Sequels     [ edit ]   Written works   Noel Streatfeild 's 1949 novel  The Painted Garden  (U.S. title  Movie Shoes ) has as its central story the filming of  The Secret Garden  in Hollywood. A novel about the adult lives of Mary, Colin, and Dickon was written by  Susan Moody  in 1995 and published under two different titles:  Misselthwaite: The Sequel to the Secret Garden  and  Return to the Secret Garden . The  New York Times  also published a brief parodic sequel [ 14 ]  in 1995. A different sequel novel,  Till All the Seas Run Dry , was written by Susan Webb and published in 1998.     [ edit ]   Dramatic media   A 2000 sequel entitled  Return to the Secret Garden  was directed by  Scott Featherstone  and won the Director's Gold Award at the 2001 Santa Clarita International Film Festival. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   In 2001, the  TV movie   Back to the Secret Garden , directed by Michael Tuchner, shows Mary and Colin as married adults who have made Craven Manor into a shelter for orphans. It starred  Joan Plowright  as Martha and  George Baker  as Will Weatherstaff (a younger relative of Ben Weatherstaff), with  Camilla Belle  as an American orphan, Lizzie.

Unwanted by them, she has been put into the care of an  Ayah  from birth and told to keep out of sight lest her appearance upsets her mother and father. When an outbreak of  cholera  orphans her, she is sent to Misselthwaite Manor, an isolated country house in  Yorkshire, England . There, she is left mostly to her own devices, by her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a widower still mourning his beautiful young wife, who has died ten years earlier. Hoping to escape his painful memories, he travels constantly, leaving the  manor  in the charge of his  housekeeper , the stern Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald has locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.

When Mary's uncle visits the house briefly for the first time since she arrived, Mary asks him for a bit of earth to make a flower garden, and he agrees. Thanks to the invigorating Yorkshire air and her new-found fascination with the garden, Mary herself begins to blossom, and loses her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   One night Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive and say they cannot hear anything or say that it was the wind. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and is morbidly convinced that Colin will develop the same condition. This fear is shared by Colin who for psychological reasons has never learned to walk. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums. Colin, however, accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often.   As spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous because Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon than indoors with him. One day he voices his resentment and, when Mary resists, he throws a tantrum. To the surprise and amusement of the servants, Mary continues to stand her ground. That evening, Colin has a  hysterical  fit, brought on by his fear of dying young. Mary goes to him and, again taking a firm, no-nonsense stance with him and to calm him down slaps him in the face and to the servants' surprise, when Mary starts screaming at him, he doesn't object. When he asks if he can visit the garden with her, she agrees, as she and Dickon had been planning to suggest it themselves, feeling that it would do Colin good. Colin's doctor, who is Mr. Craven's brother and Colin's uncle, agrees to have Dickon and Mary take Colin outside in a wheelchair. Colin is delighted with the garden, and visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows. As the garden revives and flourishes, so does he. To keep the garden a secret Colin orders everyone to stay away from the path to the Secret Garden.   The first person to discover what the children are doing is the old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, who was a favorite of Colin's mother. Since her death, he has been visiting the locked garden once or twice a year by secretly scaling the wall with a ladder. When he visits the garden for the first time since Mary's arrival (having had to miss several visits because of  rheumatism ), he is angry with the children until he sees how improved both the garden and Colin are. Colin orders him not to tell anybody, and he agrees. Colin resolves that the next time his father returns from abroad he will be able to walk and run like a normal boy. He accomplishes this through a combination of simple physical exercise taught by Dickon and positive thinking. He refuses to think of himself as crippled, and he invents a kind of  mantra  to keep himself in the right, or ""magic,"" frame of mind. He makes great progress, but keeps it hidden from everyone but Mary, Dickon, and Ben, wanting it to be a surprise.   Mr. Craven has been traveling throughout Europe but hurries home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream, imploring him to come to her ""in the garden!"" When he receives a letter from Martha and Dickon's mother (who also knows the secret) saying ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here"", he decides to return home. He arrives while the children are outdoors. He goes out to see Colin for himself, and finds himself drawn to the secret garden, where he is astonished first to hear children's voices and then to find Colin not only racing Mary and Dickon around the garden, but winning. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. Afterwards they walk back to the house, where the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.   Maytham Hall in  Kent, England , where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage to Stephen Townesend, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.  [ 2 ]  Burnett kept an extensive garden, including an impressive rose garden. However, it has been noted that besides the garden, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Major themes   The author, Frances Hodgson Burnett, was a practitioner of  Christian Science  due to the premature death of her son as well as personal illness. [ 4 ]  As a result,  The Secret Garden  espouses the concepts of  New Thought  and  theosophy  as well as ideas about the healing powers of the mind. [ 5 ]   The garden is the book's central symbol. The secret garden at Misselthwaite Manner is the site of both the near destruction and the subsequent regeneration of a family  [ 6 ]  Using the garden motif, Burnett explores the healing power inherent in living things.     [ edit ]   Publication History & Popularity   The Secret Garden first appeared to the public in serial format aimed at adults in 1910, one year prior to its release in book format. Marketing to both adult and juvenile audiences may have had an effect on its early reception; the book was not as celebrated as Burnett's previous works during her lifetime.  [ 7 ]   The Secret Garden paled in comparison to the popularity of Burnett's other works for a long period of time. Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Anne H. Lundin noted [ 8 ]  that the author's obituary notices all remarked on  Little Lord Fauntleroy  and passed over  The Secret Garden  in silence.   With the rise of scholarly work in children's literature over the past quarter century, The Secret Garden has steadily risen to prominence, and is now arguably Burnett's best known work. The book is often noted as one of the best children's books of the twentieth century  [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Film, TV, or theatrical adaptations   The Secret Garden  has been adapted many times for stage and screen. The first filmed version was made in 1919 by the  Famous Players-Lasky Corporation  with 17 year old  Lila Lee  as Mary and  Paul Willis  as Dickon, but the film is considered lost.   In 1949,  MGM  filmed  the second adaptation  with  Margaret O'Brien . This version was mostly in black-and-white, but the sequences set in the restored garden were filmed in  Technicolor . In 1959,  Dorothea Brooking  adapted the book into a six-part BBC television serial starring  Colin Spaull  as Dickon. Brooking was also responsible for adaptations in 1952 and 1975, both for the BBC. In 1987  Hallmark Hall of Fame  filmed a TV adaptation of the novel starring  Gennie James  as Mary,  Barret Oliver  as Dickon, and  Jadrien Steele  as Colin. A young  Colin Firth  also made a brief appearance as an adult version of Colin Craven.   The most acclaimed film adaptation was  American Zoetrope 's  1993 production . It was directed by  Agnieszka Holland  and starred  Kate Maberly  as Mary,  Heydon Prowse  as Colin,  Andrew Knott  as Dickon and  Dame Maggie Smith  as Mrs. Medlock.   A 2000 sequel entitled  Return to the Secret Garden  was directed by  Scott Featherstone  and won the Director's Gold Award at the 2001 Santa Clarita International Film Festival. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  In 2001, the  TV movie   Back to the Secret Garden , directed by Michael Tuchner, was set in a time when Mary and Colin have married and turned Craven Manor into a shelter for orphans. It starred  Joan Plowright ,  George Baker  and  Camilla Belle  as an American orphan, Lizzie. [ 12 ]   In 1991, a  Japanese animated  version of  The Secret Garden  was made, entitled  Himitsu no Hanazono . [ 13 ]  Another anime movie,  Sk no Strain  (2006), based on another Frances Hodgson Burnett novel,  A Little Princess , draws some elements from  The Secret Garden , mostly the names of Colin, Mary, Martha and Dickon. [ 14 ]   Stage adaptations of the book have been created. One notable adaptation  is a  musical  with music by  Lucy Simon  and book and lyrics by  Marsha Norman , which opened on  Broadway  in 1991. The production was nominated for seven  Tony Awards , winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Daisy Eagan  as Mary, at eleven years old is the youngest person ever to win a Tony).   In 2007 the  Orlando Shakespeare Theater  commissioned April-Dawn Gladu to create an adaptation for their Theater For Young Audiences series. This version's unique qualities include an actress silently playing The Garden Tree, which was the tree that Lilly fell from years ago. As the children work secretly in the garden to bring it to life, the living tree wakes up, flourishes and blooms. [ 15 ]   Oakland Ballet has also done a production of  The Secret Garden  set to music by Sir Edward Elgar.  The Secret Garden  has also been done as an opera, and will be presented by Northwest Children's Opera in June of 2009.   Novels based on the source material have also been produced.  Noel Streatfeild 's novel  The Painted Garden  (U.S. title  Movie Shoes ) has as its central story the filming of  The Secret Garden  in Hollywood.   An unofficial novel about the adult lives of Mary, Colin, and Dickon was written by  Susan Moody  in 1995 and published under two different titles:  Misselthwaite: The Sequel to the Secret Garden  and  Return to the Secret Garden . The  New York Times  also published a brief parodic sequel [ 16 ]  in the same year.

Orphaned by an outbreak of  cholera , she is sent back to England to the legal guardianship of her only remaining relative: her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a reclusive widower.   Craven still mourns the death of his beautiful young wife, Lilias, from ten years ago. To escape his sad memories, he constantly travels abroad, leaving Mary and the  manor  under the supervision of his  housekeeper , Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   After Mary finds the key to the secret garden, a  robin  shows her where the door is hidden by overgrown ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle visits the house briefly for the first time since she arrived, Mary asks him for a bit of earth to make a flower garden, and he agrees. Thanks to the invigorating Yorkshire air and her new-found fascination with the garden, Mary herself begins to blossom, and loses her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   On several occasions, Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive; they tell her that she is hearing things, or blame the sound on ordinary sources such as the wind or a servant with a toothache. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and both he and Colin are morbidly convinced that the boy will develop the same condition. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums. Colin, however, accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often.   As spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous because Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon than indoors with him.

That evening, Colin has a  hysterical  fit, brought on by his fear of dying young. Mary goes to him and, again taking a firm, no-nonsense stance with him, slaps him in the face to shock him out of his hysteria; to the servants' surprise, when Mary screams back at him, he doesn't object.   When Colin asks if he can visit the garden with her, she agrees, as she and Dickon had been planning to suggest it themselves, feeling that it would do Colin good. Colin's doctor, who is Mr. Craven's cousin, agrees to let Dickon and Mary take Colin outside in a wheelchair. To maintain their secret, Colin orders everyone else to stay out of the gardens on those occasions. Colin is delighted with his mother's garden, and visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows. As the garden revives and flourishes, so does he.   The first adult to discover what the children are doing is the old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, who was a favorite of Colin's mother. After her death, he visited the locked garden once or twice a year by secretly scaling the wall with a ladder. When he visits the garden for the first time since Mary's arrival (having had to miss several visits because of  rheumatism ), he is angry with the children until he sees how improved both the garden and Colin are.

The Secret Garden  is a  novel  by  Frances Hodgson Burnett . It was initially published in serial format starting in autumn 1910; the book was first published in its entirety in  1911 .   Its working title was  Mistress Mary , in reference to the English nursery rhyme  Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary . It is now one of Burnett's most popular novels, and is considered to be a classic of children's literature.

Orphaned by an outbreak of  cholera , she is sent back to England to the legal guardianship of her only remaining relative: her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a reclusive widower.   Craven still mourns the death of his wife, Lilias, from ten years ago. To escape his sad memories, he constantly travels abroad, leaving Mary and the  manor  under the supervision of his  housekeeper , Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   Mary finds the key to the secret garden and a  robin  shows her where the door is hidden beneath overgrown ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle briefly meets with her for the first time since her arrival, Mary asks him for permission to claim her own garden from any abandoned part of the grounds, and he acquiesces. Thanks to her new-found interests and activities, Mary herself begins to blossom, losing her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   On several occasions, Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive. They tell her that she is hearing things, or they blame the sound on ordinary sources such as the wind, or a servant with a toothache. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and both he and Colin are morbidly convinced that the boy will develop the same condition. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums.   Colin accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often, but as spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous that Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon. One day, Colin threatens to ban Dickon from the grounds, but Mary matches his bad temper and storms out without an apology. That evening, Colin escalates into a  hysterical  tantrum, convinced that he is becoming hunchbacked and is going to die; Mary shocks him out of his hysteria by screaming back at him. She also demands to see his back, and points out that the lumps behind his neck are simply the outlines of normal  vertebrae  like her own. Reassured, Colin agrees to let her bring Dickon to visit him inside his room, and they become friends.   They bring Colin outside in a wheelchair so he can see his mother's garden. Delighted, he visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows, ordering everyone else to stay away on those occasions. Despite these orders, the children are discovered by the old gardener Ben Weatherstaff, who tried to maintain the roses after Lilias' death by surreptitiously scaling the wall once or twice a year. Ben is angry with them at first, but agrees to share and keep their secret.   As the garden revives and flourishes, so does Colin. He resolves to walk and run like a normal boy by the next time his father returns home; to accomplish these aims, he carries out a program of simple physical exercises and positive thinking. He makes great progress, but they conceal it from the rest of the household with the pretense that he is still an invalid.   Mr. Craven is traveling through Europe, but is inspired to rush home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream and receiving a letter from Mrs. Sowerby (Martha's and Dickon's mother, who also knows the secret) telling him, ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here."" He arrives while the children are outdoors and finds himself drawn toward the secret garden. As he approaches nearer, he is astonished to hear their voices inside the walls; Colin bursts out of the garden door toward him, actually winning a footrace against Mary and Dickon. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. When they return to the house, the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.     [ edit ]   Major themes   The author, Frances Hodgson Burnett, was a practitioner of  Christian Science  due to the premature death of her son as well as personal illness. [ 2 ]  As a result,  The Secret Garden  espouses the concepts of  New Thought  and  theosophy  as well as ideas about the healing powers of the mind. [ 3 ]   The garden is the book's central symbol. The secret garden at Misselthwaite Manor is the site of both the near-destruction and the subsequent regeneration of a family  [ 4 ]  Using the garden motif, Burnett explores the healing power inherent in living things.   Maytham Hall in  Kent, England , where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage to Stephen Townesend, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.  [ 5 ]  Burnett kept an extensive garden, including an impressive rose garden. However, it has been noted that besides the garden, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Publication history   The Secret Garden  was first serialized, starting in autumn 1910, in  The American Magazine , a publication aimed at adults. The entire book was first published in summer 1911 by Frederick A. Stokes in New York and by  Heinemann  in London. Its  copyright  expired in the US in 1987 and in most other parts of the world in 1995, placing the book in the  public domain .     [ edit ]   Public reception   Marketing to both adult and juvenile audiences may have had an effect on its early reception; the book was not as celebrated as Burnett's previous works during her lifetime.  [ 7 ]   The Secret Garden  paled in comparison to the popularity of Burnett's other works for a long period. Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Anne H. Lundin noted [ 8 ]  that the author's obituary notices all remarked on  Little Lord Fauntleroy  and passed over  The Secret Garden  in silence.   With the rise of scholarly work in children's literature over the past quarter-century,  The Secret Garden  has steadily risen to prominence, and is now arguably Burnett's best-known work. The book is often noted as one of the best children's books of the twentieth century  [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Dramatic adaptations   The Secret Garden  has been adapted many times for other media. The following list is non-exhaustive and omits various items in audio and print format such as  audiobooks ,  radio plays ,  abridged   storybooks , and random derived works such as  cookbooks  and  paper dolls . The appendices of the book's  Norton Critical Edition  contain a more comprehensive analysis of the book's many transformations.     [ edit ]   Live-action     [ edit ]   Films   The first filmed version was made in 1919 by the  Famous Players-Lasky Corporation  with 17 year old  Lila Lee  as Mary and  Paul Willis  as Dickon, but the film is considered lost.   In 1949,  MGM  filmed  the second adaptation  with  Margaret O'Brien . This version was mostly in black-and-white, but the sequences set in the restored garden were filmed in  Technicolor .   The most acclaimed film adaptation is  American Zoetrope 's  1993 production . It was directed by  Agnieszka Holland  and starred  Kate Maberly  as Mary,  Heydon Prowse  as Colin,  Andrew Knott  as Dickon and  Dame Maggie Smith  as Mrs. Medlock.     [ edit ]   Television   Dorothea Brooking  adapted the book into several different television serials for the BBC: an eight-part serial in 1952, a six-part serial in 1960 (starring  Colin Spaull  as Dickon), and a three-part serial in 1975.   In 1987,  Hallmark Hall of Fame  filmed a TV adaptation of the novel starring  Gennie James  as Mary,  Barret Oliver  as Dickon, and  Jadrien Steele  as Colin.  Derek Jacobi  plays the role of Archibald Craven, with  Alison Doody  appearing in flashbacks and visions as Lilias; a young  Colin Firth  also makes a brief appearance as the adult Colin Craven.     [ edit ]   Stage   Stage adaptations of the book have also been created.  One notable adaptation  is a  musical  with music by  Lucy Simon  and book and lyrics by  Marsha Norman , which opened on  Broadway  in 1991. The production was nominated for seven  Tony Awards , winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Daisy Eagan  as Mary, at eleven years old is the youngest person ever to win a Tony).   In 2007 the  Orlando Shakespeare Theater  commissioned April-Dawn Gladu to create an adaptation for their Theater For Young Audiences series. This version's unique qualities include an actress silently playing The Garden Tree, which was the tree that Lilias fell from years ago. As the children work secretly in the garden to bring it to life, the living tree wakes up, flourishes and blooms. [ 10 ]   Oakland Ballet has produced  The Secret Garden  set to music by Sir Edward Elgar. [ 11 ]   The Secret Garden  has also been made into an opera by Clover Loehr & Conan McLemore, and will be presented by Northwest Children's Opera in June of 2009.     [ edit ]   Animation   In 1991, a  Japanese animated  version of  The Secret Garden  was made, entitled  Himitsu no Hanazono . [ 12 ]   As part of the ""ABC Weekend Special"" series, another animated version was made in 1995, with  Derek Jacobi  as the voice of Archibald Craven.   Another anime movie,  Sk no Strain  (2006), based on another Frances Hodgson Burnett novel,  A Little Princess , draws some elements from  The Secret Garden , mostly the names of Colin, Mary, Martha and Dickon. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Sequels     [ edit ]   Written works   Noel Streatfeild 's 1949 novel  The Painted Garden  (U.S. title  Movie Shoes ) has as its central story the filming of  The Secret Garden  in Hollywood. A novel about the adult lives of Mary, Colin, and Dickon was written by  Susan Moody  in 1995 and published under two different titles:  Misselthwaite: The Sequel to the Secret Garden  and  Return to the Secret Garden . The  New York Times  also published a brief parodic sequel [ 14 ]  in 1995. A different sequel novel,  Till All the Seas Run Dry , was written by Susan Webb and published in 1998.     [ edit ]   Dramatic media   A 2000 sequel entitled  Return to the Secret Garden  was directed by  Scott Featherstone  and won the Director's Gold Award at the 2001 Santa Clarita International Film Festival. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   In 2001, the  TV movie   Back to the Secret Garden , directed by Michael Tuchner, shows Mary and Colin as married adults who have made Craven Manor into a shelter for orphans. It starred  Joan Plowright  as Martha and  George Baker  as Will Weatherstaff (a younger relative of Ben Weatherstaff), with  Camilla Belle  as an American orphan, Lizzie.

Orphaned by an outbreak of  cholera , she is sent back to England to the legal guardianship of her only remaining relative: her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a reclusive widower.   Craven still mourns the death of his beautiful young wife, Lilias, from ten years ago. To escape his sad memories, he constantly travels abroad, leaving Mary and the  manor  under the supervision of his  housekeeper , Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   After Mary finds the key to the secret garden, a  robin  shows her where the door is hidden by overgrown ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle visits the house briefly for the first time since she arrived, Mary asks him for a bit of earth to make a flower garden, and he agrees. Thanks to the invigorating Yorkshire air and her new-found fascination with the garden, Mary herself begins to blossom, and loses her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   On several occasions, Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive; they tell her that she is hearing things, or blame the sound on ordinary sources such as the wind or a servant with a toothache. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and both he and Colin are morbidly convinced that the boy will develop the same condition. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums. Colin, however, accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often.   As spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous because Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon than indoors with him. One day he voices his resentment and, when Mary resists, he throws a tantrum. To the surprise and amusement of the servants, Mary continues to stand her ground. That evening, Colin has a  hysterical  fit, brought on by his fear of dying young. Mary goes to him and, again taking a firm, no-nonsense stance with him, slaps him in the face to shock him out of his hysteria; to the servants' surprise, when Mary screams back at him, he doesn't object.   When Colin asks if he can visit the garden with her, she agrees, as she and Dickon had been planning to suggest it themselves, feeling that it would do Colin good. Colin's doctor, who is Mr. Craven's cousin, agrees to let Dickon and Mary take Colin outside in a wheelchair. To maintain their secret, Colin orders everyone else to stay out of the gardens on those occasions. Colin is delighted with his mother's garden, and visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows. As the garden revives and flourishes, so does he.   The first adult to discover what the children are doing is the old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, who was a favorite of Colin's mother. After her death, he visited the locked garden once or twice a year by secretly scaling the wall with a ladder. When he visits the garden for the first time since Mary's arrival (having had to miss several visits because of  rheumatism ), he is angry with the children until he sees how improved both the garden and Colin are. Colin orders him not to tell anybody, and he agrees. Colin resolves that the next time his father returns from abroad he will be able to walk and run like a normal boy. He accomplishes this through a combination of simple physical exercise taught by Dickon and positive thinking. He refuses to think of himself as crippled, and he invents a kind of  mantra  to keep himself in the right, or ""magic,"" frame of mind. He makes great progress, but keeps it hidden from everyone but Mary, Dickon, and Ben, wanting it to be a surprise.   Mr. Craven has been traveling throughout Europe, but is inspired to rush home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream and receiving a letter from Mrs. Sowerby (Martha's and Dickon's mother, who also knows the secret) telling him, ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here"". He arrives while the children are outdoors. He goes out to see Colin for himself, and finds himself drawn to the secret garden, where he is astonished to hear children's voices and then to find Colin not only racing Mary and Dickon around the garden, but winning. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. Afterwards they walk back to the house, where the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.

The secret garden at Misselthwaite Manner is the site of both the near-destruction and the subsequent regeneration of a family  [ 4 ]  Using the garden motif, Burnett explores the healing power inherent in living things.   Maytham Hall in  Kent, England , where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage to Stephen Townesend, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.  [ 5 ]  Burnett kept an extensive garden, including an impressive rose garden. However, it has been noted that besides the garden, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Publication History & Popularity   The Secret Garden first appeared to the public in serial format aimed at adults in 1910, one year prior to its release in book format. Marketing to both adult and juvenile audiences may have had an effect on its early reception; the book was not as celebrated as Burnett's previous works during her lifetime.  [ 7 ]   The Secret Garden paled in comparison to the popularity of Burnett's other works for a long period. Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Anne H. Lundin noted [ 8 ]  that the author's obituary notices all remarked on  Little Lord Fauntleroy  and passed over  The Secret Garden  in silence.   With the rise of scholarly work in children's literature over the past quarter century, The Secret Garden has steadily risen to prominence, and is now arguably Burnett's best known work. The book is often noted as one of the best children's books of the twentieth century  [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Dramatic adaptations   The Secret Garden  has been adapted many times for other media.     [ edit ]   Live-action     [ edit ]   Films   The first filmed version was made in 1919 by the  Famous Players-Lasky Corporation  with 17 year old  Lila Lee  as Mary and  Paul Willis  as Dickon, but the film is considered lost.   In 1949,  MGM  filmed  the second adaptation  with  Margaret O'Brien . This version was mostly in black-and-white, but the sequences set in the restored garden were filmed in  Technicolor .   The most acclaimed film adaptation is  American Zoetrope 's  1993 production . It was directed by  Agnieszka Holland  and starred  Kate Maberly  as Mary,  Heydon Prowse  as Colin,  Andrew Knott  as Dickon and  Dame Maggie Smith  as Mrs. Medlock.     [ edit ]   Television   Dorothea Brooking  adapted the book into several different television serials for the BBC: an eight-part serial in 1952, a six-part serial in 1960 (starring  Colin Spaull  as Dickon), and a three-part serial in 1975.   In 1987,  Hallmark Hall of Fame  filmed a TV adaptation of the novel starring  Gennie James  as Mary,  Barret Oliver  as Dickon, and  Jadrien Steele  as Colin.  Derek Jacobi  plays the role of Archibald Craven, with  Alison Doody  appearing in flashbacks and visions as Lilias; a young  Colin Firth  also makes a brief appearance as the adult Colin Craven.     [ edit ]   Stage   Stage adaptations of the book have also been created.  One notable adaptation  is a  musical  with music by  Lucy Simon  and book and lyrics by  Marsha Norman , which opened on  Broadway  in 1991. The production was nominated for seven  Tony Awards , winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Daisy Eagan  as Mary, at eleven years old is the youngest person ever to win a Tony).   In 2007 the  Orlando Shakespeare Theater  commissioned April-Dawn Gladu to create an adaptation for their Theater For Young Audiences series. This version's unique qualities include an actress silently playing The Garden Tree, which was the tree that Lilias fell from years ago. As the children work secretly in the garden to bring it to life, the living tree wakes up, flourishes and blooms. [ 10 ]   Oakland Ballet has produced  The Secret Garden  set to music by Sir Edward Elgar. [ 11 ]   The Secret Garden  has also been made into an opera by Clover Loehr & Conan McLemore, and will be presented by Northwest Children's Opera in June of 2009.     [ edit ]   Animation   In 1991, a  Japanese animated  version of  The Secret Garden  was made, entitled  Himitsu no Hanazono . [ 12 ]   As part of the ""ABC Weekend Special"" series, another animated version was made in 1995, with  Derek Jacobi  as the voice of Archibald Craven.   Another anime movie,  Sk no Strain  (2006), based on another Frances Hodgson Burnett novel,  A Little Princess , draws some elements from  The Secret Garden , mostly the names of Colin, Mary, Martha and Dickon. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Sequels     [ edit ]   Written works   Noel Streatfeild 's 1949 novel  The Painted Garden  (U.S. title  Movie Shoes ) has as its central story the filming of  The Secret Garden  in Hollywood. A novel about the adult lives of Mary, Colin, and Dickon was written by  Susan Moody  in 1995 and published under two different titles:  Misselthwaite: The Sequel to the Secret Garden  and  Return to the Secret Garden . The  New York Times  also published a brief parodic sequel [ 14 ]  in 1995. A different sequel novel,  Till All the Seas Run Dry , was written by Susan Webb and published in 1998.     [ edit ]   Dramatic media   A 2000 sequel entitled  Return to the Secret Garden  was directed by  Scott Featherstone  and won the Director's Gold Award at the 2001 Santa Clarita International Film Festival. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   In 2001, the  TV movie   Back to the Secret Garden , directed by Michael Tuchner, shows Mary and Colin as married adults who have made Craven Manor into a shelter for orphans. It starred  Joan Plowright  as Martha and  George Baker  as Will Weatherstaff (a younger relative of Ben Weatherstaff), with  Camilla Belle  as an American orphan, Lizzie.

Orphaned by an outbreak of  cholera , she is sent back to England to the legal guardianship of her only remaining relative: her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a reclusive widower.   Craven still mourns the death of his beautiful young wife, Lilias, from ten years ago. To escape his sad memories, he constantly travels abroad, leaving Mary and the  manor  under the supervision of his  housekeeper , Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   After Mary finds the key to the secret garden, a  robin  shows her where the door is hidden by overgrown ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle visits the house briefly for the first time since she arrived, Mary asks him for a bit of earth to make a flower garden, and he agrees. Thanks to the invigorating Yorkshire air and her new-found fascination with the garden, Mary herself begins to blossom, and loses her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   On several occasions, Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive; they tell her that she is hearing things, or blame the sound on ordinary sources such as the wind or a servant with a toothache. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and both he and Colin are morbidly convinced that the boy will develop the same condition. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums. Colin, however, accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often.   As spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous because Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon than indoors with him. One day he voices his resentment and, when Mary resists, he throws a tantrum. To the surprise and amusement of the servants, Mary continues to stand her ground. That evening, Colin has a  hysterical  fit, brought on by his fear of dying young. Mary goes to him and, again taking a firm, no-nonsense stance with him, slaps him in the face to shock him out of his hysteria; to the servants' surprise, when Mary screams back at him, he doesn't object.   When Colin asks if he can visit the garden with her, she agrees, as she and Dickon had been planning to suggest it themselves, feeling that it would do Colin good. Colin's doctor, who is Mr. Craven's cousin, agrees to let Dickon and Mary take Colin outside in a wheelchair. To maintain their secret, Colin orders everyone else to stay out of the gardens on those occasions. Colin is delighted with his mother's garden, and visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows. As the garden revives and flourishes, so does he.   The first adult to discover what the children are doing is the old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, who was a favorite of Colin's mother. After her death, he visited the locked garden once or twice a year by secretly scaling the wall with a ladder. When he visits the garden for the first time since Mary's arrival (having had to miss several visits because of  rheumatism ), he is angry with the children until he sees how improved both the garden and Colin are. Colin orders him not to tell anybody, and he agrees. Colin resolves that the next time his father returns from abroad he will be able to walk and run like a normal boy. He accomplishes this through a combination of simple physical exercise taught by Dickon and positive thinking. He refuses to think of himself as crippled, and he invents a kind of  mantra  to keep himself in the right, or ""magic,"" frame of mind. He makes great progress, but keeps it hidden from everyone but Mary, Dickon, and Ben, wanting it to be a surprise.   Mr. Craven has been traveling throughout Europe, but is inspired to rush home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream and receiving a letter from Mrs. Sowerby (Martha's and Dickon's mother, who also knows the secret) telling him, ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here"". He arrives while the children are outdoors. He goes out to see Colin for himself, and finds himself drawn to the secret garden, where he is astonished to hear children's voices and then to find Colin not only racing Mary and Dickon around the garden, but winning. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. Afterwards they walk back to the house, where the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.

The Secret Garden  is a  novel  by  Frances Hodgson Burnett , first published in  1911 . Its working title was  Mistress Mary , in reference to the English nursery rhyme  Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary . It is one of Burnett's most popular novels, and is now considered a classic of children's literature.

Unwanted by them, she has been put into the care of an  Ayah  from birth and told to keep out of sight lest her appearance upsets her mother and father. When an outbreak of  cholera  orphans her, she is sent to Misselthwaite Manor, an isolated country house in  Yorkshire, England . There, she is left mostly to her own devices, by her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a widower still mourning his beautiful young wife, who has died ten years earlier. Hoping to escape his painful memories, he travels constantly, leaving the  manor  in the charge of his  housekeeper , the stern Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald has locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   Mary finds the key and a  robin  shows her the door to the garden behind some ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon Sowerby, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle visits the house briefly for the first time since she arrived, Mary asks him for a bit of earth to make a flower garden, and he agrees. Thanks to the invigorating Yorkshire air and her new-found fascination with the garden, Mary herself begins to blossom, and loses her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   One night Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive and say they cannot hear anything or say that it was the wind. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and is morbidly convinced that Colin will develop the same condition. This fear is shared by Colin who for psychological reasons has never learned to walk. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums. Colin, however, accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often.   As spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous because Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon than indoors with him. One day he voices his resentment and, when Mary resists, he throws a tantrum. To the surprise and amusement of the servants, Mary continues to stand her ground. That evening, Colin has a  hysterical  fit, brought on by his fear of dying young. Mary goes to him and, again taking a firm, no-nonsense stance with him and to calm him down slaps him in the face and to the servants' surprise, when Mary starts screaming at him, he doesn't object. When he asks if he can visit the garden with her, she agrees, as she and Dickon had been planning to suggest it themselves, feeling that it would do Colin good. Colin's doctor, who is Mr. Craven's brother and Colin's uncle, agrees to have Dickon and Mary take Colin outside in a wheelchair. Colin is delighted with the garden, and visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows. As the garden revives and flourishes, so does he. To keep the garden a secret Colin orders everyone to stay away from the path to the Secret Garden.   The first person to discover what the children are doing is the old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, who was a favorite of Colin's mother. Since her death, he has been visiting the locked garden once or twice a year by secretly scaling the wall with a ladder. When he visits the garden for the first time since Mary's arrival (having had to miss several visits because of  rheumatism ), he is angry with the children until he sees how improved both the garden and Colin are. Colin orders him not to tell anybody, and he agrees. Colin resolves that the next time his father returns from abroad he will be able to walk and run like a normal boy. He accomplishes this through a combination of simple physical exercise taught by Dickon and positive thinking. He refuses to think of himself as crippled, and he invents a kind of  mantra  to keep himself in the right, or ""magic,"" frame of mind. He makes great progress, but keeps it hidden from everyone but Mary, Dickon, and Ben, wanting it to be a surprise.   Mr. Craven has been traveling throughout Europe but hurries home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream, imploring him to come to her ""in the garden!"" When he receives a letter from Martha and Dickon's mother (who also knows the secret) saying ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here"", he decides to return home. He arrives while the children are outdoors. He goes out to see Colin for himself, and finds himself drawn to the secret garden, where he is astonished first to hear children's voices and then to find Colin not only racing Mary and Dickon around the garden, but winning. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. Afterwards they walk back to the house, where the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.   Maytham Hall in  Kent, England , where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage to Stephen Townesend, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.  [ 2 ]  Burnett kept an extensive garden, including an impressive rose garden. However, it has been noted that besides the garden, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Major themes   The author, Frances Hodgson Burnett, was a practitioner of  Christian Science  due to the premature death of her son as well as personal illness. [ 4 ]  As a result,  The Secret Garden  espouses the concepts of  New Thought  and  theosophy  as well as ideas about the healing powers of the mind. [ 5 ]   The garden is the book's central symbol. The secret garden at Misselthwaite Manner is the site of both the near destruction and the subsequent regeneration of a family  [ 6 ]  Using the garden motif, Burnett explores the healing power inherent in living things.     [ edit ]   Publication History & Popularity   The Secret Garden first appeared to the public in serial format aimed at adults in 1910, one year prior to its release in book format. Marketing to both adult and juvenile audiences may have had an effect on its early reception; the book was not as celebrated as Burnett's previous works during her lifetime.  [ 7 ]   The Secret Garden paled in comparison to the popularity of Burnett's other works for a long period of time. Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Anne H. Lundin noted [ 8 ]  that the author's obituary notices all remarked on  Little Lord Fauntleroy  and passed over  The Secret Garden  in silence.   With the rise of scholarly work in children's literature over the past quarter century, The Secret Garden has steadily risen to prominence, and is now arguably Burnett's best known work. The book is often noted as one of the best children's books of the twentieth century  [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Dramatic adaptations and sequels   The Secret Garden  has been adapted many times for stage and screen. The first filmed version was made in 1919 by the  Famous Players-Lasky Corporation  with 17 year old  Lila Lee  as Mary and  Paul Willis  as Dickon, but the film is considered lost.   In 1949,  MGM  filmed  the second adaptation  with  Margaret O'Brien . This version was mostly in black-and-white, but the sequences set in the restored garden were filmed in  Technicolor . In 1959,  Dorothea Brooking  adapted the book into a six-part BBC television serial starring  Colin Spaull  as Dickon. Brooking was also responsible for adaptations in 1952 and 1975, both for the BBC. In 1987  Hallmark Hall of Fame  filmed a TV adaptation of the novel starring  Gennie James  as Mary,  Barret Oliver  as Dickon, and  Jadrien Steele  as Colin. A young  Colin Firth  also made a brief appearance as an adult version of Colin Craven.   The most acclaimed film adaptation was  American Zoetrope 's  1993 production . It was directed by  Agnieszka Holland  and starred  Kate Maberly  as Mary,  Heydon Prowse  as Colin,  Andrew Knott  as Dickon and  Dame Maggie Smith  as Mrs. Medlock.   A 2000 sequel entitled  Return to the Secret Garden  was directed by  Scott Featherstone  and won the Director's Gold Award at the 2001 Santa Clarita International Film Festival. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  In 2001, the  TV movie   Back to the Secret Garden , directed by Michael Tuchner, was set in a time when Mary and Colin have married and turned Craven Manor into a shelter for orphans. It starred  Joan Plowright ,  George Baker  and  Camilla Belle  as an American orphan, Lizzie. [ 12 ]   In 1991, a  Japanese animated  version of  The Secret Garden  was made, entitled  Himitsu no Hanazono . [ 13 ]  Another anime movie,  Sk no Strain  (2006), based on another Frances Hodgson Burnett novel,  A Little Princess , draws some elements from  The Secret Garden , mostly the names of Colin, Mary, Martha and Dickon. [ 14 ]   Stage adaptations of the book have been created. One notable adaptation  is a  musical  with music by  Lucy Simon  and book and lyrics by  Marsha Norman , which opened on  Broadway  in 1991. The production was nominated for seven  Tony Awards , winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Daisy Eagan  as Mary, at eleven years old is the youngest person ever to win a Tony).   In 2007 the  Orlando Shakespeare Theater  commissioned April-Dawn Gladu to create an adaptation for their Theater For Young Audiences series. This version's unique qualities include an actress silently playing The Garden Tree, which was the tree that Lilly fell from years ago. As the children work secretly in the garden to bring it to life, the living tree wakes up, flourishes and blooms. [ 15 ]   Oakland Ballet has also done a production of  The Secret Garden  set to music by Sir Edward Elgar.  The Secret Garden  has also been done as an opera, and will be presented by Northwest Children's Opera in June of 2009.   Novels based on the source material have also been produced.  Noel Streatfeild 's novel  The Painted Garden  (U.S. title  Movie Shoes ) has as its central story the filming of  The Secret Garden  in Hollywood.   An unofficial novel about the adult lives of Mary, Colin, and Dickon was written by  Susan Moody  in 1995 and published under two different titles:  Misselthwaite: The Sequel to the Secret Garden  and  Return to the Secret Garden . The  New York Times  also published a brief parodic sequel [ 16 ]  in the same year.

Orphaned by an outbreak of  cholera , she is sent back to England to the legal guardianship of her only remaining relative: her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a reclusive widower.   Craven still mourns the death of his wife, Lilias, from ten years ago. To escape his sad memories, he constantly travels abroad, leaving Mary and the  manor  under the supervision of his  housekeeper , Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   Mary finds the key to the secret garden and a  robin  shows her where the door is hidden beneath overgrown ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle briefly meets with her for the first time since her arrival, Mary asks him for permission to claim her own garden from any abandoned part of the grounds, and he acquiesces. Thanks to her new-found interests and activities, Mary herself begins to blossom, losing her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   On several occasions, Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive. They tell her that she is hearing things, or they blame the sound on ordinary sources such as the wind, or a servant with a toothache. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and both he and Colin are morbidly convinced that the boy will develop the same condition. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums.   Colin accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often, but as spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous that Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon. One day, Colin threatens to ban Dickon from the grounds, but Mary matches his bad temper and storms out without an apology. That evening, Colin escalates into a  hysterical  tantrum, convinced that he is becoming hunchbacked and is going to die; Mary shocks him out of his hysteria by screaming back at him. She also demands to see his back, and points out that the lumps behind his neck are simply the outlines of normal  vertebrae  like her own. Reassured, Colin agrees to let her bring Dickon to visit him inside his room, and they become friends.   They bring Colin outside in a wheelchair so he can see his mother's garden. Delighted, he visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows, ordering everyone else to stay away on those occasions. Despite these orders, the children are discovered by the old gardener Ben Weatherstaff, who tried to maintain the roses after Lilias' death by surreptitiously scaling the wall once or twice a year. Ben is angry with them at first, but agrees to share and keep their secret.   As the garden revives and flourishes, so does Colin. He resolves to walk and run like a normal boy by the next time his father returns home; to accomplish these aims, he carries out a program of simple physical exercises and positive thinking. He makes great progress, but they conceal it from the rest of the household with the pretense that he is still an invalid.   Mr. Craven is traveling through Europe, but is inspired to rush home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream and receiving a letter from Mrs. Sowerby (Martha's and Dickon's mother, who also knows the secret) telling him, ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here."" He arrives while the children are outdoors and finds himself drawn toward the secret garden. As he approaches nearer, he is astonished to hear their voices inside the walls; Colin bursts out of the garden door toward him, actually winning a footrace against Mary and Dickon. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. When they return to the house, the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.

Derek Jacobi  plays the role of Archibald Craven, with  Alison Doody  appearing in flashbacks and visions as Lilias; a young  Colin Firth  also makes a brief appearance as the adult Colin Craven.     [ edit ]   Stage   Stage adaptations of the book have also been created.  One notable adaptation  is a  musical  with music by  Lucy Simon  and book and lyrics by  Marsha Norman , which opened on  Broadway  in 1991. The production was nominated for seven  Tony Awards , winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Daisy Eagan  as Mary, at eleven years old is the youngest person ever to win a Tony).   In 2007 the  Orlando Shakespeare Theater  commissioned April-Dawn Gladu to create an adaptation for their Theater For Young Audiences series. This version's unique qualities include an actress silently playing The Garden Tree, which was the tree that Lilias fell from years ago. As the children work secretly in the garden to bring it to life, the living tree wakes up, flourishes and blooms. [ 10 ]   Oakland Ballet has produced  The Secret Garden  set to music by Sir Edward Elgar. [ 11 ]   The Secret Garden  has also been made into an opera by Clover Loehr & Conan McLemore, and will be presented by Northwest Children's Opera in June of 2009.     [ edit ]   Animation   In 1991, a  Japanese animated  version of  The Secret Garden  was made, entitled  Himitsu no Hanazono . [ 12 ]   As part of the ""ABC Weekend Special"" series, another animated version was made in 1995, with  Derek Jacobi  as the voice of Archibald Craven.   Another anime movie,  Sk no Strain  (2006), based on another Frances Hodgson Burnett novel,  A Little Princess , draws some elements from  The Secret Garden , mostly the names of Colin, Mary, Martha and Dickon. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Sequels     [ edit ]   Written works   Noel Streatfeild 's 1949 novel  The Painted Garden  (U.S. title  Movie Shoes ) has as its central story the filming of  The Secret Garden  in Hollywood. A novel about the adult lives of Mary, Colin, and Dickon was written by  Susan Moody  in 1995 and published under two different titles:  Misselthwaite: The Sequel to the Secret Garden  and  Return to the Secret Garden . The  New York Times  also published a brief parodic sequel [ 14 ]  in 1995. A different sequel novel,  Till All the Seas Run Dry , was written by Susan Webb and published in 1998.     [ edit ]   Dramatic media   A 2000 sequel entitled  Return to the Secret Garden  was directed by  Scott Featherstone  and won the Director's Gold Award at the 2001 Santa Clarita International Film Festival. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   In 2001, the  TV movie   Back to the Secret Garden , directed by Michael Tuchner, shows Mary and Colin as married adults who have made Craven Manor into a shelter for orphans. It starred  Joan Plowright  as Martha and  George Baker  as Will Weatherstaff (a younger relative of Ben Weatherstaff), with  Camilla Belle  as an American orphan, Lizzie.

It is set primarily in the  emergency room  of fictional County General Hospital in  Chicago ,  Illinois .

[ 1 ]  It premiered on September 19, 1994 and has been aired on Thursday nights at 10:00 for its entire run. On April 2, 2008, NBC announced that the series will return for its 15th, concluding season. [ 2 ]  Originally scheduled to run for 19 episodes before retiring with a two-hour series finale to be broadcast on March 12, 2009, [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  NBC recently announced it will extend  ER  by an additional three episodes to a full 22 episode order as part of a deal to launch a new series by John Wells. [ 5 ]  ER's final episode is scheduled to air on April 2, 2009 with a one-hour retrospective preceding it. [ 6 ]     History and production   In 1974, author  Michael Crichton  wrote a screenplay based on his own experiences as a medical resident in a busy ER. The screenplay went nowhere, and Crichton focused on other topics. In 1990, he published the novel  Jurassic Park , and in 1993 began a collaboration with director  Steven Spielberg  on the  film adaptation  of that. The Crichton-Spielberg team then returned to  ER  but decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film. Spielberg's  Amblin Entertainment  provided  John Wells  as the show's executive producer.   The script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in  1974 . The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 made the Dr. Lewis character a woman and the Dr. Benton character an African-American, and shortened the running time by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV. [ 7 ]   Due to a lack of time and money to build a set, the pilot episode of  ER  was filmed in the former  Linda Vista Community Hospital  in Los Angeles, an old facility that ceased operating as a medical center in 1990. [ 8 ]  A set modeled after Los Angeles County General Hospital's emergency room was built soon after at the  Warner Bros.  studios in  Burbank, California , although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city's famous  ""L""  train platforms.   ER  premiered on Monday, September 19, 1994 from 9:00-11:00 p.m. (EDT) and moved into the 10:00 p.m Thursday night timeslot three days later, where it remained for all fifteen seasons. Steven Spielberg left the show after one year in a producer's chair, but he made one critical decision with lasting effects: the Carol Hathaway character, who died at the end of the original script for the pilot episode, was retained.   ER  was filmed in 1.78:1  widescreen  from the start, even though it was not broadcast in widescreen until the seventh season when it began appearing in the  1080i  HD format where NBC was being broadcast digitally. [ citation needed ]  Since the sixth episode of Season 7, it has appeared in  letterbox  format when in standard definition. As a result, every US DVD box set shows the widescreen versions of the episodes, including those episodes originally broadcast in 1.33:1 (full screen) format. The episodes also appear in 1080i widescreen when rerun on  TNT HD , though the first six seasons still show in fullscreen on the digital  TNT  network. Only the live episode ""Ambush"" at the beginning of the fourth season, and the opening credits for the first six seasons, are in standard 4:3 aspect ratio.     Episodes       Main article:  List of ER episodes       ER  has had many memorable episodes, and is particularly notable for broadcasting a live episode, ""Ambush,"" in 1997, with the NBC camera crew disguised as a  PBS  crew making a documentary film in the hospital. The actors performed the show again three hours later so that the  West Coast  airing would be live as well. This episode received  Emmy Award  nominations for Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic), and won the Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Series.   Most episodes center on the ER, with almost all scenes at the hospital. There is, however, often at least one scene showing the goings-on of the ER staff outside the hospital. Also, there is a tradition to feature storylines each season completely outside of the ER. One early such instance involved a road trip near Las Vegas, Nevada (Drs. Ross and Greene). Season Eight included a storyline in Hawaii (Drs. Greene and Corday). More recently, the series has included storylines in Democratic Republic of Congo (Drs. Kovac and Carter) and Darfur, Sudan (Drs. Pratt and Carter, with Noah Wyle appearing as a guest star in the season following his departure from the show).     Cast     Main cast          Original cast of the show (1994-1995)         Original cast   The original cast consisted of  Anthony Edwards  as Dr. Mark Greene,  George Clooney  as Dr. Doug Ross,  Sherry Stringfield  as Dr. Susan Lewis,  Noah Wyle  as John Carter, and  Eriq La Salle  as Dr. Peter Benton.  Julianna Margulies  guest starred in the pilot as Carol Hathaway before becoming part of the regular cast.     Additions to main cast   The first addition to the cast came towards the end of Season One with Jeanie Boulet ( Gloria Reuben ) joining the supporting cast and later becoming part of the main cast in Season Two.  Laura Innes  signed on to the supporting cast in Season Two as Kerry Weaver before becoming part of the main cast in Season Three. Anna Del Amico ( Maria Bello ) was introduced at the end of Season Three and then joined the main cast at the beginning of Season Four where Elizabeth Corday ( Alex Kingston ) is also introduced. Season Five began with the addition of  Kellie Martin  as Medical student Lucy Knight and Season Six opened with the addition of then-unknown Croatian actor  Goran Visnjic  to the cast as the tragic Dr. Luka Kovac and soon after,  Maura Tierney  as Abby Lockhart, who together formed the series longest running, and most complicated, romantic relationship. That season also saw the addition of  Paul McCrane  as Dr. Robert ""Rocket"" Romano to the main cast after being part of the supporting cast in both Seasons Four and Five.  Michael Michele  as Dr. Cleo Finch and  Erik Palladino  as Dr. Dave Malucci also joined the cast that season and finally,  Ming-Na  returned to reprise a character she had created as a supporting actress in Season One, Jing-Mei ""Deb"" Chen. Season Eight saw the addition of  Sharif Atkins  as Michael Gallant.  Mekhi Phifer  originated the character of Dr. Greg Pratt in Season Eight and joined the main cast in Season Nine. Season Ten saw the addition of  Parminder Nagra  as Dr. Neela Rasgotra and  Linda Cardellini  as Nurse Samantha Taggart.  Scott Grimes  joined the supporting cast in Season Ten as Dr. Archie Morris and became part of the main cast in Season Twelve;  Shane West  joined the cast in Season Eleven as Dr. Ray Barnett. Season Thirteen saw the addition of  John Stamos  as Dr. Tony Gates, reprising a role he originated in Season Twelve as an Emergency Medical Technician. Season Fourteen saw the introduction of supporting actor  David Lyons  as Dr. Simon Brenner; Lyons would join the main cast in Season Fifteen, along with  Angela Bassett  as Dr. Cate Banfield.     Departures from main cast   Sherry Stringfield 's first departure on the show was in 1996, when her character,  Susan Lewis , moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in the Season 3 episode ""Union Station."" In 2001, Stringfield returned to the series, reprising her role of Dr. Lewis, in the Season 8 episode ""Never Say Never."" She departed again in the Season 12 premiere, ""Canon City."" This second departure was not depicted, but rather mentioned by character  Kerry Weaver  four episodes later in ""Wake Up,"" when she explains that Susan had accepted a tenure-track position at a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa, after having been denied tenure at County.   After playing  Anna Del Amico  for one season,  Maria Bello  was not a part of the ensemble cast when Season 5 began. Like  Susan Lewis 's second exit, her character's departure was mentioned but not depicted; in the season premiere, ""Day for Knight,""  Carter  explains to new medical student  Lucy Knight  that the locker she is inheriting used to belong to Anna Del Amico, who is working in a pediatric ER back in Philadelphia, where she has family and a boyfriend.   George Clooney  left the show in 1999, in the Season 5 episode ""The Storm, Part 2,"" when his character,  Doug Ross , quit before being fired by County for his involvement in a patient's death. Clooney returned in the season 6 episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow"" in a cameo when his character reunited with  Carol Hathaway .   Gloria Reuben  departed early in Season 6, in the episode ""The Peace of Wild Things,"" when her character,  Jeanie Boulet , decided to become a stay-at-home mom and care for her newly adopted HIV-positive baby. Reuben returned in the season 14 episode ""Status Quo"" with her HIV positive child.   Kellie Martin , who played medical student  Lucy Knight , left the series midway through Season 6 in the episode ""All In The Family,"" when her character was killed by a patient suffering from undiagnosed  schizophrenia ; his  psychotic break  occurred before a backed-up psychiatry department could arrive in the ER for a consult.   Julianna Margulies  left the show at the end of Season 6, in the episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow,"" when her character,  Carol Hathaway , decided on the spur of the moment to go to Seattle, Washington, and reunite with  Doug Ross , her true love and the father of her twin daughters.   Erik Palladino  departed early in Season 8, in the episode (""Never Say Never"") after his character,  Dave Malucci , was fired for inappropriate conduct.   Eriq La Salle 's character,  Peter Benton , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". He took a job with a set schedule at another hospital in order to spend more time with his son, Reese, and his girlfriend, former fellow ER doctor  Cleo Finch . La Salle returned in the season 8 episodes ""It's All in Your Head"" in a cameo to speak with Elizabeth Corday and ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Michael Michele 's character,  Cleo Finch , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" with her boyfriend, and fellow doctor,  Peter Benton , after having previously taken a job at the same hospital with set schedules (in fact it was she who arranged the interview which resulted in Benton's job offer). Michele returned in the season 8 episode ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Anthony Edwards 's character,  Mark Greene , died of a brain tumor in Season 8's penultimate episode, ""On the Beach."" Unusually, Anthony Edwards was credited in the following episode ""Lockdown"". Edwards returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" where he appeared in multiple flashback scenes to give insight into the past of Angela Bassett's character. [ 9 ]   Paul McCrane 's character,  Robert Romano , whose arm had been severed just above the elbow by a helicopter's tail rotor in the Season 9 premiere ""Chaos Theory,"" was killed in the Season 10 episode ""Freefall"" when a helicopter that was taking off from the hospital roof was buffeted by strong winds, causing it to crash on the roof and plummet over the side of the building; it fell into a crowded ambulance bay and landed squarely on Romano. McCrane returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Sharif Atkins  left the series in the Season 10 episode ""Where There's Smoke,"" when his character,  Michael Gallant , revealed that the Army was sending him to Iraq. Atkins returned in the Season 11 episodes ""Here and There"" and ""Back in the World"" in several scenes taking place in Iraq and then again in the season 12 episodes ""Two Ships,"" ""I Do,"" ""Split Decisions,"" and ""The Gallant Hero and The Tragic Victor"" where he married Neela and then returned to Iraq where he was killed by an  improvised explosive device  while serving a second tour there.   Alex Kingston 's character,  Elizabeth Corday , left the series in the Season 11 episode ""Fear"" after getting in trouble for performing an illegal organ donation procedure; rather than being summarily fired, County offered her a demotion to a non-tenured position, but she turned it down and opted to return to England instead. In an interview with Britain's  Radio Times  magazine, Kingston spoke of being written off the show due to her age, a statement that sparked some controversy. She later withdrew that claim. [ 10 ]  Kingston returned in the 15th season episode ""Dream Runner"" in two of Neela's dream sequences. [ 11 ]   Ming-Na  left in Season 11 as an attending physician when her character,  Jing-Mei Chen , resigned in in order to take care of her ailing father, whom she later  euthanized  in the episode ""Twas the Night."" This was the second time her character left County General; in season 1, medical student ""Deb"" Chen recurred in an eight episode story arc which concluded with her leaving medical school after accidentally leaving a guide wire in a patient's chest and deciding she was better suited to do research than to do applied medicine.   Noah Wyle  left in the Season 11 finale, ""The Show Must Go On."" His character,  John Carter , after having received tenure at County, decided to reunite with his girlfriend  Kem Likasu  (portrayed by  Thandie Newton ). Wyle returned in the season 12 episodes ""Quintessence of Dust,"" ""Darfur,"" ""No Place to Hide,"" and ""There Are No Angels Here"" where he is practicing medicine in Darfur and then again in the 15th season episode ""The Beginning of the End,"" the first of five episodes he'll return for.   Laura Innes  left midway through Season 13, in the episode ""A House Divided,"" when a reluctant  Luka Kova  was forced by budget cuts to fire her character,  Kerry Weaver . After bracing for a battle to keep her position, and in spite of the fact that Kova realized he must find a way to keep her on staff, Weaver ultimately decided to resign from County and accept a job offer from a television station in Miami, Florida. Innes returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Shane West  left at the end of the 13th season after his character,  Ray Barnett  lost both his legs and returned to Baton Rouge with his mother to recuperate. West's final appearance as a main cast member was in ""The Honeymoon is Over."" West returned in the 15th season episode ""Haunted"" to visit Neela and the rest of the staff.   Mekhi Phifer  departed during the first episode of Season 15. His character,  Gregory Pratt , died in the ER as the result of blast injuries suffered in an ambulance explosion in the final episode of Season 14.   Goran Visnjic  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with his TV wife Abby Lockhart. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  Luka had previously left the show in the season finale of season 13 when he left for Croatia to care for his ailing father. He returned for seven episodes in season 14 to wrap up his medical storyline and then made a brief appearance in ""Book of Abby"" where he, Abby, and their son Joe embark on their new life together.   Maura Tierney  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with her TV husband Luka Kovac. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  She attempted to leave the ER quietly, however the rest of the staff made it known how much they will miss her. Nurse Haleh Adams showed Abby a hidden wall with the locker labels of all the past staff members since season one, with the exception of Carter who refused to deface government property (the other names on the wall were mostly departed former characters as well as some prominent writers and producers). Abby then left the ER and met Luka and her son Joe outside where they embark on their new life together.

Wyle was previously billed as a guest star for a four-episode appearance in Season 12. [ 12 ]   Note 2 :  Although Edwards was billed with the regular cast in Episode 316, his was a single-episode reprise of role he left at the end of Season 8. [ 13 ]     Cast continuity          Cast of the fifteenth and final season (2008-2009)         Main cast   Over the life of the series, the show saw the replacement of all principal characters from the pilot episode between Season Five (Doug Ross) and Season Eleven (John Carter). While the show saw introduction of new main characters, departed actors occasionally returned for extra-contractual scenes after their characters' departures. The first of these scenes came at the end of Season Six, when George Clooney (as Doug Ross) is seen briefly in the final appearance of the Carol Hathaway character. The next of these scenes came at the end of Season Eight when Eriq La Salle (as Peter Benton) and Michael Michele (as Cleo Finch) are seen briefly at Mark Greene's funeral. More recent scenes have included guest appearances by Sharif Atkins in Seasons Eleven and Twelve, Noah Wyle in Season Twelve, and Gloria Reuben in Season Fourteen, leading to a series of guest appearances in Season Fifteen by some of the former cast, including Shane West, Anthony Edwards, Laura Innes, Paul McCrane, Alex Kingston, Noah Wyle, and longtime supporting actors Abraham Benrubi and William H. Macy.     Supporting cast   Continuity has also been maintained by the frequent appearances of secondary characters such as Nurses  Haleh Adams ,  Lily Jarvik ,  Malik McGrath , and  Chuny Marquez  (played by  Yvette Freeman ,  Lily Mariye ,  Deezer D , and  Laura Cern , respectively) and Paramedics Dwight Zadro (Mont Russell) and Doris Pickman (Emily Wagner).             This article may contain wording that  promotes the subject in a subjective manner  without imparting real information . Please remove or replace such wording or find  sources  which back the claims.         Setting the tone   One of the most memorable aspects of continuity between former and current cast members throughout the history of the series has been the statement--usually made from a senior or outgoing staff member in the ER to the Chief Resident, that ""You set the tone."" This was first heard in the series premiere, when the department chief, Dr. Morgenstern (William H. Macy) told Chief Resident Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) ""You set the tone, Mark."" As an outgoing attending, Dr. Greene repeated this admonition to Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) at the end of Season Eight. When Dr. Carter, now an attending, left the show in Season Eleven, he said the same to Dr. Archie Morris (Scott Grimes), then taking over as Chief Resident. Most recently, Dr. Carter reminded Dr. Morris, now also an attending, of this in his return to the series in Season 15, episode 16 (""The Beginning of the End"").     Directors   Finally, Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver) and Paul McCrane (Robert Romano) have regularly returned to the set of ER as directors, most recently in the Season 15 episode ""Age of Innocence"" (McCrane) and the Season 14 episode ""Coming Home"" (Innes). Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton) also returned to direct the Season 15 episode ""The Family Man.""

It is set primarily in the  emergency room  of fictional County General Hospital in  Chicago ,  Illinois .

[ 1 ]  It premiered on September 19, 1994 and has been aired on Thursday nights at 10:00 for its entire run. On April 2, 2008, NBC announced that the series will return for its 15th, concluding season. [ 2 ]  Originally scheduled to run for 19 episodes before retiring with a two-hour series finale to be broadcast on March 12, 2009, [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  NBC recently announced it will extend  ER  by an additional three episodes to a full 22 episode order as part of a deal to launch a new series by John Wells. [ 5 ]  ER's final episode is scheduled to air on April 2, 2009 with a one-hour retrospective preceding it. [ 6 ]     History and production   In 1974, author  Michael Crichton  wrote a screenplay based on his own experiences as a medical resident in a busy ER. The screenplay went nowhere, and Crichton focused on other topics. In 1990, he published the novel  Jurassic Park , and in 1993 began a collaboration with director  Steven Spielberg  on the  film adaptation  of that. The Crichton-Spielberg team then returned to  ER  but decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film. Spielberg's  Amblin Entertainment  provided  John Wells  as the show's executive producer.   The script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in  1974 . The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 made the Dr. Lewis character a woman and the Dr. Benton character an African-American, and shortened the running time by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV. [ 7 ]   Due to a lack of time and money to build a set, the pilot episode of  ER  was filmed in the former  Linda Vista Community Hospital  in Los Angeles, an old facility that ceased operating as a medical center in 1990. [ 8 ]  A set modeled after Los Angeles County General Hospital's emergency room was built soon after at the  Warner Bros.  studios in  Burbank, California , although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city's famous  ""L""  train platforms.   ER  premiered on Monday, September 19, 1994 from 9:00-11:00 p.m. (EDT) and moved into the 10:00 p.m Thursday night timeslot three days later, where it remained for all fifteen seasons. Steven Spielberg left the show after one year in a producer's chair, but he made one critical decision with lasting effects: the Carol Hathaway character, who died at the end of the original script for the pilot episode, was retained.   ER  was filmed in 1.78:1  widescreen  from the start, even though it was not broadcast in widescreen until the seventh season when it began appearing in the  1080i  HD format where NBC was being broadcast digitally. [ citation needed ]  Since the sixth episode of Season 7, it has appeared in  letterbox  format when in standard definition. As a result, every US DVD box set shows the widescreen versions of the episodes, including those episodes originally broadcast in 1.33:1 (full screen) format. The episodes also appear in 1080i widescreen when rerun on  TNT HD , though the first six seasons still show in fullscreen on the digital  TNT  network. Only the live episode ""Ambush"" at the beginning of the fourth season, and the opening credits for the first six seasons, are in standard 4:3 aspect ratio.     Episodes       Main article:  List of ER episodes       ER  has had many memorable episodes, and is particularly notable for broadcasting a live episode, ""Ambush,"" in 1997, with the NBC camera crew disguised as a  PBS  crew making a documentary film in the hospital. The actors performed the show again three hours later so that the  West Coast  airing would be live as well. This episode received  Emmy Award  nominations for Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic), and won the Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Series.   Most episodes center on the ER, with almost all scenes at the hospital. There is, however, often at least one scene showing the goings-on of the ER staff outside the hospital. Also, there is a tradition to feature storylines each season completely outside of the ER. One early such instance involved a road trip near Las Vegas, Nevada (Drs. Ross and Greene). Season Eight included a storyline in Hawaii (Drs. Greene and Corday). More recently, the series has included storylines in Democratic Republic of Congo (Drs. Kovac and Carter) and Darfur, Sudan (Drs. Pratt and Carter, with Noah Wyle appearing as a guest star in the season following his departure from the show).     Cast     Main cast          Original cast of the show (1994-1995)         Original cast   The original cast consisted of  Anthony Edwards  as Dr. Mark Greene,  George Clooney  as Dr. Doug Ross,  Sherry Stringfield  as Dr. Susan Lewis,  Noah Wyle  as John Carter, and  Eriq La Salle  as Dr. Peter Benton.  Julianna Margulies  guest starred in the pilot as Carol Hathaway before becoming part of the regular cast.     Additions to main cast   The first addition to the cast came towards the end of Season One with Jeanie Boulet ( Gloria Reuben ) joining the supporting cast and later becoming part of the main cast in Season Two.  Laura Innes  signed on to the supporting cast in Season Two as Kerry Weaver before becoming part of the main cast in Season Three. Anna Del Amico ( Maria Bello ) was introduced at the end of Season Three and then joined the main cast at the beginning of Season Four where Elizabeth Corday ( Alex Kingston ) is also introduced. Season Five began with the addition of  Kellie Martin  as Medical student Lucy Knight and Season Six opened with the addition of then-unknown Croatian actor  Goran Visnjic  to the cast as the tragic Dr. Luka Kovac and soon after,  Maura Tierney  as Abby Lockhart, who together formed the series longest running, and most complicated, romantic relationship. That season also saw the addition of  Paul McCrane  as Dr. Robert ""Rocket"" Romano to the main cast after being part of the supporting cast in both Seasons Four and Five.  Michael Michele  as Dr. Cleo Finch and  Erik Palladino  as Dr. Dave Malucci also joined the cast that season and finally,  Ming-Na  returned to reprise a character she had created as a supporting actress in Season One, Jing-Mei ""Deb"" Chen. Season Eight saw the addition of  Sharif Atkins  as Michael Gallant.  Mekhi Phifer  originated the character of Dr. Greg Pratt in Season Eight and joined the main cast in Season Nine. Season Ten saw the addition of  Parminder Nagra  as Dr. Neela Rasgotra and  Linda Cardellini  as Nurse Samantha Taggart.  Scott Grimes  joined the supporting cast in Season Ten as Dr. Archie Morris and became part of the main cast in Season Twelve;  Shane West  joined the cast in Season Eleven as Dr. Ray Barnett. Season Thirteen saw the addition of  John Stamos  as Dr. Tony Gates, reprising a role he originated in Season Twelve as an Emergency Medical Technician. Season Fourteen saw the introduction of supporting actor  David Lyons  as Dr. Simon Brenner; Lyons would join the main cast in Season Fifteen, along with  Angela Bassett  as Dr. Cate Banfield.     Departures from main cast   Sherry Stringfield 's first departure on the show was in 1996, when her character,  Susan Lewis , moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in the Season 3 episode ""Union Station."" In 2001, Stringfield returned to the series, reprising her role of Dr. Lewis, in the Season 8 episode ""Never Say Never."" She departed again in the Season 12 premiere, ""Canon City."" This second departure was not depicted, but rather mentioned by character  Kerry Weaver  four episodes later in ""Wake Up,"" when she explains that Susan had accepted a tenure-track position at a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa, after having been denied tenure at County.   After playing  Anna Del Amico  for one season,  Maria Bello  was not a part of the ensemble cast when Season 5 began. Like  Susan Lewis 's second exit, her character's departure was mentioned but not depicted; in the season premiere, ""Day for Knight,""  Carter  explains to new medical student  Lucy Knight  that the locker she is inheriting used to belong to Anna Del Amico, who is working in a pediatric ER back in Philadelphia, where she has family and a boyfriend.   George Clooney  left the show in 1999, in the Season 5 episode ""The Storm, Part 2,"" when his character,  Doug Ross , quit before being fired by County for his involvement in a patient's death. Clooney returned in the season 6 episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow"" in a cameo when his character reunited with  Carol Hathaway .   Gloria Reuben  departed early in Season 6, in the episode ""The Peace of Wild Things,"" when her character,  Jeanie Boulet , decided to become a stay-at-home mom and care for her newly adopted HIV-positive baby. Reuben returned in the season 14 episode ""Status Quo"" with her HIV positive child.   Kellie Martin , who played medical student  Lucy Knight , left the series midway through Season 6 in the episode ""All In The Family,"" when her character was killed by a patient suffering from undiagnosed  schizophrenia ; his  psychotic break  occurred before a backed-up psychiatry department could arrive in the ER for a consult.   Julianna Margulies  left the show at the end of Season 6, in the episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow,"" when her character,  Carol Hathaway , decided on the spur of the moment to go to Seattle, Washington, and reunite with  Doug Ross , her true love and the father of her twin daughters.   Erik Palladino  departed early in Season 8, in the episode (""Never Say Never"") after his character,  Dave Malucci , was fired for inappropriate conduct.   Eriq La Salle 's character,  Peter Benton , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". He took a job with a set schedule at another hospital in order to spend more time with his son, Reese, and his girlfriend, former fellow ER doctor  Cleo Finch . La Salle returned in the season 8 episodes ""It's All in Your Head"" in a cameo to speak with Elizabeth Corday and ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Michael Michele 's character,  Cleo Finch , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" with her boyfriend, and fellow doctor,  Peter Benton , after having previously taken a job at the same hospital with set schedules (in fact it was she who arranged the interview which resulted in Benton's job offer). Michele returned in the season 8 episode ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Anthony Edwards 's character,  Mark Greene , died of a brain tumor in Season 8's penultimate episode, ""On the Beach."" Unusually, Anthony Edwards was credited in the following episode ""Lockdown"". Edwards returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" where he appeared in multiple flashback scenes to give insight into the past of Angela Bassett's character. [ 9 ]   Paul McCrane 's character,  Robert Romano , whose arm had been severed just above the elbow by a helicopter's tail rotor in the Season 9 premiere ""Chaos Theory,"" was killed in the Season 10 episode ""Freefall"" when a helicopter that was taking off from the hospital roof was buffeted by strong winds, causing it to crash on the roof and plummet over the side of the building; it fell into a crowded ambulance bay and landed squarely on Romano. McCrane returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Sharif Atkins  left the series in the Season 10 episode ""Where There's Smoke,"" when his character,  Michael Gallant , revealed that the Army was sending him to Iraq. Atkins returned in the Season 11 episodes ""Here and There"" and ""Back in the World"" in several scenes taking place in Iraq and then again in the season 12 episodes ""Two Ships,"" ""I Do,"" ""Split Decisions,"" and ""The Gallant Hero and The Tragic Victor"" where he married Neela and then returned to Iraq where he was killed by an  improvised explosive device  while serving a second tour there.   Alex Kingston 's character,  Elizabeth Corday , left the series in the Season 11 episode ""Fear"" after getting in trouble for performing an illegal organ donation procedure; rather than being summarily fired, County offered her a demotion to a non-tenured position, but she turned it down and opted to return to England instead. In an interview with Britain's  Radio Times  magazine, Kingston spoke of being written off the show due to her age, a statement that sparked some controversy. She later withdrew that claim. [ 10 ]  Kingston returned in the 15th season episode ""Dream Runner"" in two of Neela's dream sequences. [ 11 ]   Ming-Na  left in Season 11 as an attending physician when her character,  Jing-Mei Chen , resigned in in order to take care of her ailing father, whom she later  euthanized  in the episode ""Twas the Night."" This was the second time her character left County General; in season 1, medical student ""Deb"" Chen recurred in an eight episode story arc which concluded with her leaving medical school after accidentally leaving a guide wire in a patient's chest and deciding she was better suited to do research than to do applied medicine.   Noah Wyle  left in the Season 11 finale, ""The Show Must Go On."" His character,  John Carter , after having received tenure at County, decided to reunite with his girlfriend  Kem Likasu  (portrayed by  Thandie Newton ). Wyle returned in the season 12 episodes ""Quintessence of Dust,"" ""Darfur,"" ""No Place to Hide,"" and ""There Are No Angels Here"" where he is practicing medicine in Darfur and then again in the 15th season episode ""The Beginning of the End,"" the first of five episodes he'll return for.   Laura Innes  left midway through Season 13, in the episode ""A House Divided,"" when a reluctant  Luka Kova  was forced by budget cuts to fire her character,  Kerry Weaver . After bracing for a battle to keep her position, and in spite of the fact that Kova realized he must find a way to keep her on staff, Weaver ultimately decided to resign from County and accept a job offer from a television station in Miami, Florida. Innes returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Shane West  left at the end of the 13th season after his character,  Ray Barnett  lost both his legs and returned to Baton Rouge with his mother to recuperate. West's final appearance as a main cast member was in ""The Honeymoon is Over."" West returned in the 15th season episode ""Haunted"" to visit Neela and the rest of the staff.   Mekhi Phifer  departed during the first episode of Season 15. His character,  Gregory Pratt , died in the ER as the result of blast injuries suffered in an ambulance explosion in the final episode of Season 14.   Goran Visnjic  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with his TV wife Abby Lockhart. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  Luka had previously left the show in the season finale of season 13 when he left for Croatia to care for his ailing father. He returned for seven episodes in season 14 to wrap up his medical storyline and then made a brief appearance in ""Book of Abby"" where he, Abby, and their son Joe embark on their new life together.   Maura Tierney  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with her TV husband Luka Kovac. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  She attempted to leave the ER quietly, however the rest of the staff made it known how much they will miss her. Nurse Haleh Adams showed Abby a hidden wall with the locker labels of all the past staff members since season one, with the exception of Carter who refused to deface government property (the other names on the wall were mostly departed former characters as well as some prominent writers and producers). Abby then left the ER and met Luka and her son Joe outside where they embark on their new life together.

[ 12 ]   Note 2 :  Although Edwards was billed with the regular cast in Episode 316, his was a single-episode reprise of role he left at the end of Season 8. [ 13 ]     Cast continuity          Cast of the fifteenth and final season (2008-2009)         Main cast   Over the life of the series, the show saw the replacement of all principal characters from the pilot episode between Season Five (Doug Ross) and Season Eleven (John Carter). While the show saw introduction of new main characters, departed actors occasionally returned for extra-contractual scenes after their characters' departures. The first of these scenes came at the end of Season Six, when George Clooney (as Doug Ross) is seen briefly in the final appearance of the Carol Hathaway character. The next of these scenes came at the end of Season Eight when Eriq La Salle (as Peter Benton) and Michael Michele (as Cleo Finch) are seen briefly at Mark Greene's funeral. More recent scenes have included guest appearances by Sharif Atkins in Seasons Eleven and Twelve, Noah Wyle in Season Twelve, and Gloria Reuben in Season Fourteen, leading to a series of guest appearances in Season Fifteen by some of the former cast, including Shane West, Anthony Edwards, Laura Innes, Paul McCrane, Alex Kingston, Noah Wyle, and longtime supporting actors Abraham Benrubi and William H. Macy.     Supporting cast   Continuity has also been maintained by the frequent appearances of secondary characters such as Nurses  Haleh Adams ,  Lily Jarvik ,  Malik McGrath , and  Chuny Marquez  (played by  Yvette Freeman ,  Lily Mariye ,  Deezer D , and  Laura Cern , respectively) and Paramedics Dwight Zadro (Mont Russell) and Doris Pickman (Emily Wagner).             This article may contain wording that  promotes the subject in a subjective manner  without imparting real information . Please remove or replace such wording or find  sources  which back the claims.         Setting the tone   One of the most memorable aspects of continuity between former and current cast members throughout the history of the series has been the statement--usually made from a senior or outgoing staff member in the ER to the Chief Resident, that ""You set the tone."" This was first heard in the series premiere, when the department chief, Dr. Morgenstern (William H. Macy) told Chief Resident Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) ""You set the tone, Mark."" As an outgoing attending, Dr. Greene repeated this admonition to Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) at the end of Season Eight. When Dr. Carter, now an attending, left the show in Season Eleven, he said the same to Dr. Archie Morris (Scott Grimes), then taking over as Chief Resident. Most recently, Dr. Carter reminded Dr. Morris, now also an attending, of this in his return to the series in Season 15, episode 16 (""The Beginning of the End"").     Directors   Finally, Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver) and Paul McCrane (Robert Romano) have regularly returned to the set of ER as directors, most recently in the Season 15 episode ""Age of Innocence"" (McCrane) and the Season 14 episode ""Coming Home"" (Innes). Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton) also returned to direct the Season 15 episode ""The Family Man.""

The Secret Garden  is a  novel  by  Frances Hodgson Burnett , first published in  1911 . Its working title was  Mistress Mary , in reference to the English nursery rhyme  Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary . It is one of Burnett's most popular novels, and is now considered a classic of children's literature.

Unwanted by them, she has been put into the care of an  Ayah  from birth and told to keep out of sight lest her appearance upsets her mother and father. When an outbreak of  cholera  orphans her, she is sent to Misselthwaite Manor, an isolated country house in  Yorkshire, England . There, she is left mostly to her own devices, by her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a widower still mourning his beautiful young wife, who has died ten years earlier. Hoping to escape his painful memories, he travels constantly, leaving the  manor  in the charge of his  housekeeper , the stern Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald has locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   Mary finds the key and a  robin  shows her the door to the garden behind some ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon Sowerby, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle visits the house briefly for the first time since she arrived, Mary asks him for a bit of earth to make a flower garden, and he agrees. Thanks to the invigorating Yorkshire air and her new-found fascination with the garden, Mary herself begins to blossom, and loses her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   One night Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive and say they cannot hear anything or say that it was the wind. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and is morbidly convinced that Colin will develop the same condition. This fear is shared by Colin who for psychological reasons has never learned to walk. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums. Colin, however, accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often.   As spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous because Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon than indoors with him. One day he voices his resentment and, when Mary resists, he throws a tantrum. To the surprise and amusement of the servants, Mary continues to stand her ground. That evening, Colin has a  hysterical  fit, brought on by his fear of dying young. Mary goes to him and, again taking a firm, no-nonsense stance with him and to calm him down slaps him in the face and to the servants' surprise, when Mary starts screaming at him, he doesn't object. When he asks if he can visit the garden with her, she agrees, as she and Dickon had been planning to suggest it themselves, feeling that it would do Colin good. Colin's doctor, who is Mr. Craven's brother and Colin's uncle, agrees to have Dickon and Mary take Colin outside in a wheelchair. Colin is delighted with the garden, and visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows. As the garden revives and flourishes, so does he. To keep the garden a secret Colin orders everyone to stay away from the path to the Secret Garden.   The first person to discover what the children are doing is the old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, who was a favorite of Colin's mother. Since her death, he has been visiting the locked garden once or twice a year by secretly scaling the wall with a ladder. When he visits the garden for the first time since Mary's arrival (having had to miss several visits because of  rheumatism ), he is angry with the children until he sees how improved both the garden and Colin are. Colin orders him not to tell anybody, and he agrees. Colin resolves that the next time his father returns from abroad he will be able to walk and run like a normal boy. He accomplishes this through a combination of simple physical exercise taught by Dickon and positive thinking. He refuses to think of himself as crippled, and he invents a kind of  mantra  to keep himself in the right, or ""magic,"" frame of mind. He makes great progress, but keeps it hidden from everyone but Mary, Dickon, and Ben, wanting it to be a surprise.   Mr. Craven has been traveling throughout Europe but hurries home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream, imploring him to come to her ""in the garden!"" When he receives a letter from Martha and Dickon's mother (who also knows the secret) saying ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here"", he decides to return home. He arrives while the children are outdoors. He goes out to see Colin for himself, and finds himself drawn to the secret garden, where he is astonished first to hear children's voices and then to find Colin not only racing Mary and Dickon around the garden, but winning. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. Afterwards they walk back to the house, where the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.   Maytham Hall in  Kent, England , where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage to Stephen Townesend, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.  [ 2 ]  Burnett kept an extensive garden, including an impressive rose garden. However, it has been noted that besides the garden, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Major themes   The author, Frances Hodgson Burnett, was a practitioner of  Christian Science  due to the premature death of her son as well as personal illness. [ 4 ]  As a result,  The Secret Garden  espouses the concepts of  New Thought  and  theosophy  as well as ideas about the healing powers of the mind. [ 5 ]   The garden is the book's central symbol. The secret garden at Misselthwaite Manner is the site of both the near destruction and the subsequent regeneration of a family  [ 6 ]  Using the garden motif, Burnett explores the healing power inherent in living things.     [ edit ]   Publication History & Popularity   The Secret Garden first appeared to the public in serial format aimed at adults in 1910, one year prior to its release in book format. Marketing to both adult and juvenile audiences may have had an effect on its early reception; the book was not as celebrated as Burnett's previous works during her lifetime.  [ 7 ]   The Secret Garden paled in comparison to the popularity of Burnett's other works for a long period of time. Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Anne H. Lundin noted [ 8 ]  that the author's obituary notices all remarked on  Little Lord Fauntleroy  and passed over  The Secret Garden  in silence.   With the rise of scholarly work in children's literature over the past quarter century, The Secret Garden has steadily risen to prominence, and is now arguably Burnett's best known work. The book is often noted as one of the best children's books of the twentieth century  [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Dramatic adaptations and sequels   The Secret Garden  has been adapted many times for stage and screen. The first filmed version was made in 1919 by the  Famous Players-Lasky Corporation  with 17 year old  Lila Lee  as Mary and  Paul Willis  as Dickon, but the film is considered lost.   In 1949,  MGM  filmed  the second adaptation  with  Margaret O'Brien . This version was mostly in black-and-white, but the sequences set in the restored garden were filmed in  Technicolor . In 1959,  Dorothea Brooking  adapted the book into a six-part BBC television serial starring  Colin Spaull  as Dickon. Brooking was also responsible for adaptations in 1952 and 1975, both for the BBC. In 1987  Hallmark Hall of Fame  filmed a TV adaptation of the novel starring  Gennie James  as Mary,  Barret Oliver  as Dickon, and  Jadrien Steele  as Colin. A young  Colin Firth  also made a brief appearance as an adult version of Colin Craven.   The most acclaimed film adaptation was  American Zoetrope 's  1993 production . It was directed by  Agnieszka Holland  and starred  Kate Maberly  as Mary,  Heydon Prowse  as Colin,  Andrew Knott  as Dickon and  Dame Maggie Smith  as Mrs. Medlock.   A 2000 sequel entitled  Return to the Secret Garden  was directed by  Scott Featherstone  and won the Director's Gold Award at the 2001 Santa Clarita International Film Festival. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  In 2001, the  TV movie   Back to the Secret Garden , directed by Michael Tuchner, was set in a time when Mary and Colin have married and turned Craven Manor into a shelter for orphans. It starred  Joan Plowright ,  George Baker  and  Camilla Belle  as an American orphan, Lizzie. [ 12 ]   In 1991, a  Japanese animated  version of  The Secret Garden  was made, entitled  Himitsu no Hanazono . [ 13 ]  Another anime movie,  Sk no Strain  (2006), based on another Frances Hodgson Burnett novel,  A Little Princess , draws some elements from  The Secret Garden , mostly the names of Colin, Mary, Martha and Dickon. [ 14 ]   Stage adaptations of the book have been created. One notable adaptation  is a  musical  with music by  Lucy Simon  and book and lyrics by  Marsha Norman , which opened on  Broadway  in 1991. The production was nominated for seven  Tony Awards , winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Daisy Eagan  as Mary, at eleven years old is the youngest person ever to win a Tony).   In 2007 the  Orlando Shakespeare Theater  commissioned April-Dawn Gladu to create an adaptation for their Theater For Young Audiences series. This version's unique qualities include an actress silently playing The Garden Tree, which was the tree that Lilly fell from years ago. As the children work secretly in the garden to bring it to life, the living tree wakes up, flourishes and blooms. [ 15 ]   Oakland Ballet has also done a production of  The Secret Garden  set to music by Sir Edward Elgar.  The Secret Garden  has also been done as an opera, and will be presented by Northwest Children's Opera in June of 2009.   Novels based on the source material have also been produced.  Noel Streatfeild 's novel  The Painted Garden  (U.S. title  Movie Shoes ) has as its central story the filming of  The Secret Garden  in Hollywood.   An unofficial novel about the adult lives of Mary, Colin, and Dickon was written by  Susan Moody  in 1995 and published under two different titles:  Misselthwaite: The Sequel to the Secret Garden  and  Return to the Secret Garden . The  New York Times  also published a brief parodic sequel [ 16 ]  in the same year.

Looking back: 2008 Year in Review                               ER                                TV Series:    ER           Home  >  Library  >  Entertainment & Arts  >  TV Series             Rating:     Genre:  Drama                                                           Movie Type:  Medical Drama, Medical Show   Themes:  Doctors and Patients, Workplace Romance   Release Year:  1994   Country:  US             Run Time:  60 minutes   Plot  Created by novelist  Michael Crichton  and reportedly based on his own experiences as a medical student, the NBC hospital drama ER debuted September 19, 1994, directly opposite the similar CBS endeavor Chicago Hope. Though many critics thought that Chicago Hope had a better chance for survival than ER, the NBC series scored a surprise hit -- and over a decade later it was still firmly imbedded in the network's Thursday-night schedule, while Chicago Hope had long since vanished. Set largely in the emergency room of Chicago's fictional County General Hospital, ER focused on the professional and personal trials and tribulations of the unit's staff, with several subplots and story arcs weaving in and out of each hour-long episode. The regular cast for the  first season  consisted of  Anthony Edwards  as Dr. Mark Greene,  George Clooney  as Dr. Doug Ross, Sherry Stringfield as Dr. Susan Lewis,  Eriq La Salle  as Dr. Peter Benton,  Julianna Margulies  as Head Nurse Carol Hathaway, and  Noah Wyle  as med student (and later doctor) John Carter. Of these actors, only Sherry Stringfield and  Noah Wyle  would still be on the series as it entered its second decade on the air -- and of these two, only  Wyle  had been on the show throughout its entire run (Stringfield retired from the series in  season three , but returned five years later).    Later principals, in order of their appearance, included  Laura Innes  as Dr. Kerry Weaver,  Alex Kingston  as Dr. Elizabeth Corday, Paul McCrane as Dr. Robert Romano,  Kellie Martin  as med student Lucy Knight,  Erik Palladino  as Dr. Dave Malucci,  Goran Visnjic  as Dr. Luka Kovac,  Ming-Na  as Dr. Jing-Mei ""Deb"" Chen (a recurring character in  season one  who returned as a regular in  season six ),  Maura Tierney  as Nurse (and later Dr.) Abby Lockhart,  Michael Michele  as Dr. Cleo Finch,  Sharif Atkins  as Dr. Michael Gallant,  Mekhi Phifer  as Dr. Gregory Pratt, and  Parminder Nagra  as med student (and later doctor) Neela Rasgotra. Many of these characters' lives were intertwined romantically, while some of the characters were bitter enemies; all were uniformly fascinating. And just as in ""real life,"" there was nothing predictable about the exits of certain characters: some departed with tragic abruptness (Lucy Knight, Robert Romano), others simply bade farewell and moved on with their lives (Doug Ross, Carol Hathaway, Peter Benton); but no ""goodbye"" was as poignant and moving as the lingering illness and death of Mark Greene throughout the length and breadth of  season eight . Though the plot emphasis was on the continuing characters, a number of prominent guest stars made memorable appearances during the series' decade-plus run.  Alan Alda ,  Sally Field , and  Bob Newhart  were but three of the A-list entertainers who passed in and out of the doors of Chicago County. The winner of innumerable industry awards, ER has also earned a niche in media history as the most expensive dramatic series in TV history, reaching this particular plateau with its 13-million-dollar-per-episode average budget during the 1998-1999 season. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide      Credit    Michael Crichton  -  Executive Producer ;  Michael Crichton  -  Show Creator ;  James Newton Howard  -  Composer (Music Score) ;  Steven Spielberg  -  Executive Producer ;  John Wells  -  Executive Producer ; Christopher Chulack -  Executive Producer ; Lydia Woodward -  Executive Producer ; Carol Flint -  Executive Producer ; Neal Baer -  Executive Producer ; Jack Orman -  Executive Producer     Similar TV Series    L.A.

[ 1 ]  His family later moved to  Burbank, California , just the year before his parents gave birth to his younger brother,  Clint Howard . Howard graduated from  John Burroughs High School , and later attended the  University of Southern California 's  School of Cinematic Arts  but did not graduate. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Career     [ edit ]   Early acting roles and  The Andy Griffith Show   Howard first earned recognition for playing Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp in the film version of  The Music Man  with  Robert Preston  and  Shirley Jones . Besides appearing in  The Music Man , he appeared in the role of  Opie Taylor  in the television series  The Andy Griffith Show , which was the successful spin-off of  The Danny Thomas Show . There he portrayed the son of the local sheriff in the fictional town of  Mayberry ,  North Carolina . For eight seasons, he created a loving relationship with  Andy Griffith  on-screen, and spent a lot of time with him off-screen when not filming. The credits referred to him as ""Ronny Howard."" He also appeared in the 1963 film  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  with  Glenn Ford  and (billed as ""Ronnie Howard"") in  Little Boy Lost , a 1963 episode of the  NBC   medical drama   The Eleventh Hour  as the character Barry Stewart in the episode entitled ""Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?"", and a 1966 episode of the NBC  adventure  series  I Spy  with  Robert Culp  and  Bill Cosby .   Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.   On a  VH1  special about the 100 greatest  Child Stars , many of the interviewees considered Ron Howard to be the most successful child star of all-time, considering his two major television acting roles and his directing career. [ citation needed ]  In Season 1, Episode 3 of  Stroker and Hoop  on  Adult Swim , Stroker and Hoop ran a detective agency whose first client needed them to make Ron Howard stop controlling his mind.   In October 2008, Howard reprised his roles as Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham for the first time in over 20 years when he appeared in a video on  funnyordie.com  in which he endorsed Barack Obama and urged people to vote. The video, titled  ""Ron Howards Call to Action"" , [ 6 ] also features  Andy Griffith  and  Henry Winkler . As seen in the video, Howard is seen shaving his beard and having hair done to recreate his younger look.

[ 1 ]  It premiered on September 19, 1994 and has been aired on Thursday nights at 10:00 for its entire run. On April 2, 2008, NBC announced that the series would return for its 15th, concluding season. [ 2 ]  It was originally scheduled to run for 19 episodes before retiring with a two-hour series finale to be broadcast on March 12, 2009, [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  but NBC recently announced that it will extend  ER  by an additional three episodes to a full 22 episode order as part of a deal to launch a new series by John Wells. [ 5 ]  ER's final episode is scheduled to air on April 2, 2009 with a one-hour retrospective preceding it. [ 6 ]     History and production   In 1974, author  Michael Crichton  wrote a screenplay based on his own experiences as a medical resident in a busy ER. The screenplay went nowhere, and Crichton focused on other topics. In 1990, he published the novel  Jurassic Park , and in 1993 began a collaboration with director  Steven Spielberg  on the  film adaptation  of that. The Crichton-Spielberg team then returned to  ER  but decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film. Spielberg's  Amblin Entertainment  provided  John Wells  as the show's executive producer.   The script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in  1974 . The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 made the Dr. Lewis character a woman and the Dr. Benton character an African-American, and shortened the running time by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV. [ 7 ]   Due to a lack of time and money to build a set, the pilot episode of  ER  was filmed in the former  Linda Vista Community Hospital  in Los Angeles, an old facility that ceased operating as a medical center in 1990. [ 8 ]  A set modeled after Los Angeles County General Hospital's emergency room was built soon after at the  Warner Bros.  studios in  Burbank, California , although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city's famous  ""L""  train platforms.   ER  premiered on Monday, September 19, 1994 from 9:00-11:00 p.m. (EDT) and moved into the 10:00 p.m Thursday night timeslot three days later, where it remained for all fifteen seasons. Steven Spielberg left the show after one year in a producer's chair, but he made one critical decision with lasting effects: the Carol Hathaway character, who died at the end of the original script for the pilot episode, was retained.   ER  was filmed in 1.78:1  widescreen  from the start, even though it was not broadcast in widescreen until the seventh season when it began appearing in the  1080i  HD format where NBC was being broadcast digitally. [ citation needed ]  Since the sixth episode of Season 7, it has appeared in  letterbox  format when in standard definition. As a result, every US DVD box set shows the widescreen versions of the episodes, including those episodes originally broadcast in 1.33:1 (full screen) format. The episodes also appear in 1080i widescreen when rerun on  TNT HD , though the first six seasons still show in fullscreen on the digital  TNT  network. Only the live episode ""Ambush"" at the beginning of the fourth season, and the opening credits for the first six seasons, are in standard 4:3 aspect ratio.     Episodes   Main article:  List of ER episodes   ER  has had many memorable episodes, and is particularly notable for broadcasting a live episode, ""Ambush,"" in 1997, with the NBC camera crew disguised as a  PBS  crew making a documentary film in the hospital. The actors performed the show again three hours later so that the  West Coast  airing would be live as well. This episode received  Emmy Award  nominations for Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic), and won the Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Series.   Most episodes center on the ER, with almost all scenes at the hospital. There is, however, often at least one scene showing the goings-on of the ER staff outside the hospital. Also, there is a tradition to feature storylines each season completely outside of the ER. One early such instance involved a road trip near Las Vegas, Nevada (Drs. Ross and Greene). Season Eight included a storyline in Hawaii (Drs. Greene and Corday). More recently, the series has included storylines in Democratic Republic of Congo (Drs. Kovac and Carter) and Darfur, Sudan (Drs. Pratt and Carter, with Noah Wyle appearing as a guest star in the season following his departure from the show).     Cast     Main cast          Original cast of the show (1994-1995)       The original cast consisted of  Anthony Edwards  as Dr. Mark Greene,  George Clooney  as Dr. Doug Ross,  Sherry Stringfield  as Dr. Susan Lewis,  Noah Wyle  as John Carter, and  Eriq La Salle  as Dr. Peter Benton.  Julianna Margulies  guest starred in the pilot as Carol Hathaway before becoming part of the regular cast.   The first addition to the cast came towards the end of Season One with Jeanie Boulet ( Gloria Reuben ) joining the supporting cast and later becoming part of the main cast in Season Two.  Laura Innes  signed on to the supporting cast in Season Two as Dr. Kerry Weaver before becoming part of the main cast in Season Three. Dr. Anna Del Amico ( Maria Bello ) was introduced at the end of Season Three and then joined the main cast at the beginning of Season Four where Dr. Elizabeth Corday ( Alex Kingston ) is also introduced. Season Five began with the addition of  Kellie Martin  as Medical student Lucy Knight and Season Six opened with the addition of then-unknown Croatian actor  Goran Visnjic  to the cast as the tragic Dr. Luka Kovac and soon after,  Maura Tierney  as Abby Lockhart, who together formed the series' longest running, and most complicated, romantic relationship. That season also saw the addition of  Paul McCrane  as Dr. Robert ""Rocket"" Romano to the main cast after being part of the supporting cast in both Seasons Four and Five.  Michael Michele  as Dr. Cleo Finch and  Erik Palladino  as Dr. Dave Malucci also joined the cast that season and finally,  Ming-Na  returned to reprise a character she had created as a supporting actress in Season One, Dr. Jing-Mei ""Deb"" Chen. Season Eight saw the addition of  Sharif Atkins  as Medical student Michael Gallant and  Mekhi Phifer  originated the character of Dr. Greg Pratt at the end of Season Eight and joined the main cast at the beginning of Season Nine. Season Ten saw the addition of  Parminder Nagra  as Dr. Neela Rasgotra and  Linda Cardellini  as Nurse Samantha Taggart.  Scott Grimes  joined the supporting cast in Season Ten as Dr. Archie Morris and became part of the main cast in Season Twelve.  Shane West  joined the cast in Season Eleven as Dr. Ray Barnett and Season Thirteen saw the addition of  John Stamos  as Dr. Tony Gates, reprising a role he originated in Season Twelve as an Emergency Medical Technician. Season Fourteen saw the introduction of supporting actor  David Lyons  as Dr. Simon Brenner; Lyons would join the main cast in Season Fifteen, along with  Angela Bassett  as Dr. Cate Banfield.

Wyle was previously billed as a guest star for a four-episode appearance in Season 12. [ 9 ]   Note 2 :  Although Edwards was billed with the regular cast in Episode 316, his was a single-episode reprise of role he left at the end of Season 8. [ 10 ]     Departures from the main cast   Sherry Stringfield 's first departure on the show was in 1996, when her character,  Susan Lewis , moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in the Season 3 episode ""Union Station."" In 2001, Stringfield returned to the series, reprising her role of Dr. Lewis, in the Season 8 episode ""Never Say Never."" She departed again in the Season 12 premiere, ""Canon City."" This second departure was not depicted, but rather mentioned by character  Kerry Weaver  four episodes later in ""Wake Up,"" when she explains that Susan had accepted a tenure-track position at a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa, after having been denied tenure at County.   After playing  Anna Del Amico  for one season,  Maria Bello  was not a part of the ensemble cast when Season 5 began. Like  Susan Lewis 's second exit, her character's departure was mentioned but not depicted; in the season premiere, ""Day for Knight,""  Carter  explains to new medical student  Lucy Knight  that the locker she is inheriting used to belong to Anna Del Amico, who is working in a pediatric ER back in Philadelphia, where she has family and a boyfriend.   George Clooney  left the show in 1999, in the Season 5 episode ""The Storm, Part 2,"" when his character,  Doug Ross , quit before being fired by County for his involvement in a patient's death. Clooney returned in the season 6 episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow"" in a cameo when his character reunited with  Carol Hathaway .   Gloria Reuben  departed early in Season 6, in the episode ""The Peace of Wild Things,"" when her character,  Jeanie Boulet , decided to become a stay-at-home mom and care for her newly adopted HIV-positive baby. Reuben returned in the season 14 episode ""Status Quo"" with her HIV positive child.          Cast of the fifteenth and final season (2008-2009)       Kellie Martin , who played medical student  Lucy Knight , left the series midway through Season 6 in the episode ""All In The Family,"" when her character was killed by a patient suffering from undiagnosed  schizophrenia ; his  psychotic break  occurred before a backed-up psychiatry department could arrive in the ER for a consult.   Julianna Margulies  left the show at the end of Season 6, in the episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow,"" when her character,  Carol Hathaway , decided on the spur of the moment to go to Seattle, Washington, and reunite with  Doug Ross , her true love and the father of her twin daughters.   Erik Palladino  departed early in Season 8, in the episode (""Never Say Never"") after his character,  Dave Malucci , was fired for inappropriate conduct.   Eriq La Salle 's character,  Peter Benton , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". He took a job with a set schedule at another hospital in order to spend more time with his son, Reese, and his girlfriend, former fellow ER doctor  Cleo Finch . La Salle returned in the season 8 episodes ""It's All in Your Head"" in a cameo to speak with Elizabeth Corday and ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Michael Michele 's character,  Cleo Finch , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" with her boyfriend, and fellow doctor,  Peter Benton , after having previously taken a job at the same hospital with set schedules (in fact it was she who arranged the interview which resulted in Benton's job offer). Michele returned in the season 8 episode ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Anthony Edwards 's character,  Mark Greene , died of a brain tumor in Season 8's penultimate episode, ""On the Beach."" Unusually, Anthony Edwards was credited in the following episode ""Lockdown"". Edwards returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" where he appeared in multiple flashback scenes to give insight into the past of Angela Bassett's character. [ 11 ]   Paul McCrane 's character,  Robert Romano , whose arm had been severed just above the elbow by a helicopter's tail rotor in the Season 9 premiere ""Chaos Theory,"" was killed in the Season 10 episode ""Freefall"" when a helicopter that was taking off from the hospital roof was buffeted by strong winds, causing it to crash on the roof and plummet over the side of the building; it fell into a crowded ambulance bay and landed squarely on Romano. McCrane returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Sharif Atkins  left the series in the Season 10 episode ""Where There's Smoke,"" when his character,  Michael Gallant , revealed that the Army was sending him to Iraq. Atkins returned in the Season 11 episodes ""Here and There"" and ""Back in the World"" in several scenes taking place in Iraq and then again in the season 12 episodes ""Two Ships,"" ""I Do,"" ""Split Decisions,"" and ""The Gallant Hero and The Tragic Victor"" where he married Neela and then returned to Iraq where he was killed by an  improvised explosive device  while serving a second tour there.   Alex Kingston 's character,  Elizabeth Corday , left the series in the Season 11 episode ""Fear"" after getting in trouble for performing an illegal organ donation procedure; rather than being summarily fired, County offered her a demotion to a non-tenured position, but she turned it down and opted to return to England instead. In an interview with Britain's  Radio Times  magazine, Kingston spoke of being written off the show due to her age, a statement that sparked some controversy. She later withdrew that claim. [ 12 ]  Kingston returned in the 15th season episode ""Dream Runner"" in two of Neela's dream sequences. [ 13 ]   Ming-Na  left in Season 11 as an attending physician when her character,  Jing-Mei Chen , resigned in in order to take care of her ailing father, whom she later  euthanized  in the episode ""Twas the Night."" This was the second time her character left County General; in season 1, medical student ""Deb"" Chen recurred in an eight episode story arc which concluded with her leaving medical school after accidentally leaving a guide wire in a patient's chest and deciding she was better suited to do research than to do applied medicine.   Noah Wyle  left in the Season 11 finale, ""The Show Must Go On."" His character,  John Carter , after having received tenure at County, decided to reunite with his girlfriend  Kem Likasu  (portrayed by  Thandie Newton ). Wyle returned in the season 12 episodes ""Quintessence of Dust,"" ""Darfur,"" ""No Place to Hide,"" and ""There Are No Angels Here"" where he is practicing medicine in Darfur and then again in the 15th season episodes ""The Beginning of the End,"" ""T-Minus-6,"" and ""What We Do,"" three of five episodes he'll return for.   Laura Innes  left midway through Season 13, in the episode ""A House Divided,"" when a reluctant  Luka Kova  was forced by budget cuts to fire her character,  Kerry Weaver . After bracing for a battle to keep her position, and in spite of the fact that Kova realized he must find a way to keep her on staff, Weaver ultimately decided to resign from County and accept a job offer from a television station in Miami, Florida. Innes returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Shane West  left at the end of the 13th season after his character,  Ray Barnett  lost both his legs and returned to Baton Rouge with his mother to recuperate. West's final appearance as a main cast member was in ""The Honeymoon is Over."" West returned in the 15th season episode ""Haunted"" to visit Neela and the rest of the staff.   Mekhi Phifer  departed during the first episode of Season 15. His character,  Gregory Pratt , died in the ER as the result of blast injuries suffered in an ambulance explosion in the final episode of Season 14.   Goran Visnjic  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with his TV wife Abby Lockhart. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  Luka had previously left the show in the season finale of season 13 when he left for Croatia to care for his ailing father. He returned for seven episodes in season 14 to wrap up his medical storyline and then made a brief appearance in ""Book of Abby"" where he, Abby, and their son Joe embark on their new life together.   Maura Tierney  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with her TV husband Luka Kovac. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  She attempted to leave the ER quietly, however the rest of the staff made it known how much they will miss her. Nurse Haleh Adams showed Abby a hidden wall with the locker labels of all the past staff members since season one, with the exception of Carter who refused to deface government property (the other names on the wall were mostly departed former characters as well as some prominent writers and producers). Abby then left the ER and met Luka and her son Joe outside where they embark on their new life together.

Walker )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                       Madam Walker in a photograph ca. 1914 by  Addison Scurlock .       Madam C.J. Walker  ( December 23 ,  1867    May 25 ,  1919 ) was an  American   businesswoman ,  hair care   entrepreneur ,  tycoon  and  philanthropist . She died after World War I.   Her fortune was made by developing and marketing a hugely successful line of beauty and hair products for black women, under the company she founded Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company. The  Guinness Book of Records  cites Walker as the first female, black or white, who became a  millionaire  by her own achievements.   In  2002 , scholar  Molefi Kete Asante  listed Madam C. J. Walker on his list of  100 Greatest African Americans . [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Biography   2   See also   3   References   4   Further reading   5   External links               Biography   She was born Sarah Breedlove in  Delta, Louisiana , the first member of her family to be born free. Her parents had been slaves. At age 14, she married a man named Moses McWilliams and was widowed at age 20. She then moved to  St. Louis, Missouri  to join her brothers. Sarah worked as a laundress for as little as a dollar and a half a day, but she was able to save enough to educate her daughter. While living in St. Louis, she joined  St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church , which helped develop her speaking, interpersonal and organizational skills. She was married in 1894 to John Davis and divorced about nine years later.   When she began to lose her hair, she had the idea for a line of hair care products. Like that of most other Americans in the early 1900s, Walker's home lacked indoor plumbing, electricity and central heating. Like many women of that era, she washed her hair only once a month. As a result, she suffered from severe  dandruff  and scalp disease that nearly caused her to go bald.   In 1905, Davis moved to  Denver, Colorado , where she worked as a sales agent for Annie Malone, another black woman entrepreneur who manufactured hair care products. Sarah also consulted with a Denver pharmacist, who analyzed Malone's formula and helped Walker formulate her own products. In addition, she often told reporters that the ingredients for her ""Wonderful Hair Grower"" had come to her in a dream.   In 1906 she married Charles Joseph Walker, a St. Louis newspaperman, and changed her name to ""Madam C.J. Walker"". She founded the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company to sell hair care products and  cosmetics . Madam Walker divorced Walker in 1910 and moved her growing manufacturing operations from St. Louis to a new industrial complex in  Indianapolis . By 1917 she had the largest business in the  United States  owned by a black person.          I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations...I have built my own factory on my own ground. [ 2 ]                 There is no royal, flower-strewn path to success. And if there is, I have not found it for if I have accomplished anything in life, it is because I have been willing to work hard. [ 2 ]          Walker saw her personal wealth not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote economic opportunities for others, especially black people. She took great pride in the profitable employment  and alternative to domestic labor  that her company afforded many thousands of black women who worked as commissioned agents. Her agents could earn from $5 to $15 per day in an era when unskilled white laborers were making about $11 per week. [ 3 ]   Marjorie Joyner , who started work as one of her employees, went on to lead the next generation of African-American beauty entrepreneurs.   Walker was known for her philanthropy, leaving two-thirds of her estate to educational institutions and charities, including the  NAACP , the  Tuskegee Institute  and  Bethune-Cookman College . In 1919, her $5,000 pledge to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign was the largest gift the organization had ever received.   Walker had a mansion called "" Villa Lewaro "" built in the wealthy New York suburb of  Irvington on Hudson, New York , near the estates of  John D. Rockefeller  and  Jay Gould . She spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furnishings. [ 4 ]  The  Italianate   villa  was designed by architect  Vertner Tandy , the first registered black  architect  in the state of New York, in 1915. Walker also owned townhouses in  Indianapolis  and New York.   Madam Walker died on May 25, 1919, at age 51, at her estate  Villa Lewaro . She passed away because of kidney failure and other complications resulting from  hypertension . She was buried at  Woodlawn Cemetery  in  the Bronx .   Her daughter  A'Lelia Walker  carried on the tradition of hospitality, opening her mother's home and her own to writers and artists of the emergent  Harlem Renaissance . She promoted important members of that movement. [ 5 ]  She converted a section of her  Harlem  townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street into the Dark Tower, a salon and tearoom where Harlem and  Greenwich Village  artists, writers and musicians gathered. Poet  Langston Hughes  called her ""The joy goddess of Harlem's 1920s"" in his autobiography  The Big Sea , because of the lavish parties she hosted in Harlem and  Irvington .

Unless a buyer emerges, Colorado’s longest running business may see its doors close after 150 years, leaving more than 200 tax-paying, voting Coloradans out of work. I want to save the Rocky, and I need your help.   I ask that you work to ensure that the Department of Justice performs its due diligence as Scripps moves forward with a sale or a possible closure of the  Rocky Mountain News  and does not rush the sale through the process without proper oversight. An attempted sale during the holiday season in this recession is not a good faith effort to keep the newspaper open.   Please work to ensure that the dissolution of the joint operating agreement that governs the partnership of  The Denver Post  and the  Rocky Mountain News  follows both the spirit and the letter of the law under which it was written, a law that made it the policy of the United States to preserve newspapers. Work to ensure that the interests of  Rocky  employees are being considered. And finally work to ensure that Colorados rich cultural heritage, as preserved in the historical archives of the  Rocky Mountain News , lives on.   As the elected advocate of  Rocky Mountain News  employees and readers in Washington, you have the power to keep our state’s rich, strong journalistic voice intact and to keep Coloradans employed.

And if we cant save the  Rocky , we can, at minimum, make some noise before we go. Since the day the proposed sale of the  Rocky  was announced, weve been waiting for the odd billionaire to join our cause. This may surprise you, but none has come forward. Apparently Phil and Tim and Pat and the rest of the team must have misplaced our e-mail address. So, we turn now to the non-billionaires. We think there may be more of you.  Read more and post a comment »    Who we are and what we're doing  Ever since Denver was a collection of shacks and gold miners tents, the  Rocky Mountain News  has been here to chronicle each day of our state's life. We covered the Civil War, Colorado statehood, the Ludlow Massacre, two world wars and the Great Depression, six Broncos Super Bowls, two Stanley Cup championships, two national political conventions, the tragedy at Columbine, the fires of 2002, the Iraq war's home front, and all of Colorado's booms and busts.   This latest bust could be our last. The owners of our paper have put us up for sale and hinted at shutting us down if they cant find a buyer.    We are prepared to fight that. We are the reporters, editors, photographers, web producers and everyone who brings you the  Rocky . We take pride in what we do for our readers, our community and our industry, just as our predecessors William Byers, William A.H. Loveland, Damon Runyon, Mary Coyle Chase and Gene Amole.    Unless we can make something happen by the middle of January, our owners could close the Rocky. Colorado deserves better.    So were taking our case to you, our readers, our friends, our neighbors. Through this Web site and other efforts, the staff of the  Rocky  wants to:    Preserve and protect the editorial voice  of the  Rocky  in our community.    Preserve and protect the legacy  of the  Rocky  and its historical archives, which provide a window to the infancy of our state and the city of Denver.    Fight for the jobs  of more than 200 Coloradans and the many others that would be affected by the newspaper's closure.    The Rocky on the radio   Rocky  reporters Kevin Flynn, Lynn Bartels, David Milstead, sports columnist Sam Adams, assistant sports editor Steve Foster, news editor Curt Anderson and longtime broadcast columnist Dusty Saunders were on Peter Boyles' morning show on KHOW 630 AM Monday.

clueweb09-enwp01-22-10102	"                     Madam C. J. Walker          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Madame CJ Walker )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                       Madam Walker in a photograph ca. 1914 by  Addison Scurlock .       Madam C.J. Walker  ( December 23 ,  1867    May 25 ,  1919 ) was an  American   businesswoman ,  hair care   entrepreneur ,  tycoon  and  philanthropist . She died after World War I.   Her fortune was made by developing and marketing a hugely successful line of beauty and hair products for black women, under the company she founded Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company. The  Guinness Book of Records  cites Walker as the first female, black or white, who became a  millionaire  by her own achievements.   In  2002 , scholar  Molefi Kete Asante  listed Madam C. J. Walker on his list of  100 Greatest African Americans . [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Biography   2   See also   3   References   4   Further reading   5   External links               Biography   She was born Sarah Breedlove in  Delta, Louisiana , the first member of her family to be born free. Her parents had been slaves. At age 14, she married a man named Moses McWilliams and was widowed at age 20. She then moved to  St. Louis, Missouri  to join her brothers. Sarah worked as a laundress for as little as a dollar and a half a day, but she was able to save enough to educate her daughter. While living in St. Louis, she joined  St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church , which helped develop her speaking, interpersonal and organizational skills. She was married in 1894 to John Davis and divorced about nine years later.   When she began to lose her hair, she had the idea for a line of hair care products. Like that of most other Americans in the early 1900s, Walker's home lacked indoor plumbing, electricity and central heating. Like many women of that era, she washed her hair only once a month. As a result, she suffered from severe  dandruff  and scalp disease that nearly caused her to go bald.   In 1905, Davis moved to  Denver, Colorado , where she worked as a sales agent for Annie Malone, another black woman entrepreneur who manufactured hair care products. Sarah also consulted with a Denver pharmacist, who analyzed Malone's formula and helped Walker formulate her own products. In addition, she often told reporters that the ingredients for her ""Wonderful Hair Grower"" had come to her in a dream.   In 1906 she married Charles Joseph Walker, a St. Louis newspaperman, and changed her name to ""Madam C.J. Walker"". She founded the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company to sell hair care products and  cosmetics . Madam Walker divorced Walker in 1910 and moved her growing manufacturing operations from St. Louis to a new industrial complex in  Indianapolis . By 1917 she had the largest business in the  United States  owned by a black person.          I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations...I have built my own factory on my own ground. [ 2 ]                 There is no royal, flower-strewn path to success. And if there is, I have not found it for if I have accomplished anything in life, it is because I have been willing to work hard. [ 2 ]          Walker saw her personal wealth not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote economic opportunities for others, especially black people. She took great pride in the profitable employment  and alternative to domestic labor  that her company afforded many thousands of black women who worked as commissioned agents. Her agents could earn from $5 to $15 per day in an era when unskilled white laborers were making about $11 per week. [ 3 ]   Marjorie Joyner , who started work as one of her employees, went on to lead the next generation of African-American beauty entrepreneurs.   Walker was known for her philanthropy, leaving two-thirds of her estate to educational institutions and charities, including the  NAACP , the  Tuskegee Institute  and  Bethune-Cookman College . In 1919, her $5,000 pledge to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign was the largest gift the organization had ever received.   Walker had a mansion called "" Villa Lewaro "" built in the wealthy New York suburb of  Irvington on Hudson, New York , near the estates of  John D. Rockefeller  and  Jay Gould . She spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furnishings. [ 4 ]  The  Italianate   villa  was designed by architect  Vertner Tandy , the first registered black  architect  in the state of New York, in 1915. Walker also owned townhouses in  Indianapolis  and New York.   Madam Walker died on May 25, 1919, at age 51, at her estate  Villa Lewaro . She passed away because of kidney failure and other complications resulting from  hypertension . She was buried at  Woodlawn Cemetery  in  the Bronx .   Her daughter  A'Lelia Walker  carried on the tradition of hospitality, opening her mother's home and her own to writers and artists of the emergent  Harlem Renaissance . She promoted important members of that movement. [ 5 ]  She converted a section of her  Harlem  townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street into the Dark Tower, a salon and tearoom where Harlem and  Greenwich Village  artists, writers and musicians gathered. Poet  Langston Hughes  called her ""The joy goddess of Harlem's 1920s"" in his autobiography  The Big Sea , because of the lavish parties she hosted in Harlem and  Irvington .

Early Years  Madame CJ Walker was born in 1867 in poverty-stricken rural Louisiana. The daughter of former slaves, she was orphaned at the age of seven. Walker and her older sister survived by working in the cotton fields of Delta and Vicksburg, Mississippi. She married at age fourteen and her only daughter was born in 1885. After her husband's death two years later, she traveled to St. Louis to join her four brothers who had established themselves as barbers. Working as a laundrywoman, she managed to save enough money to educate her daughter, and became involved in activities with the National Association of Colored Women.     Inspired by Need  During the 1890s, Sarah began to suffer from a scalp ailment that caused her to lose some of her hair. Embarrassed by her appearance, she experimented with a variety of home-made remedies and products made by another black woman entrepreneur, Annie Malone. In 1905, Sarah became a sales agent for Malone and moved to Denver, where she married Charles Joseph Walker.    Madam Walker's Wonderful Hair Grower  Changing her name to Madame CJ Walker, Sarah founded her own business and began selling her own product called Madam Walker's Wonderful Hair Grower, a scalp conditioning and healing formula. To promote her products, she embarked on an exhausting sales drive throughout the South and Southeast selling her products door to door, giving demonstrations, and working on sales and marketing strategies. In 1908, she opened a college in Pittsburgh to train her ""hair culturists.""    The Walker System   Eventually, her products formed the basis of a thriving national corporation employing at one point over 3,000 people. Her Walker System, which included a broad offering of cosmetics, licensed Walker Agents, and Walker Schools offered meaningful employment and personal growth to thousands of Black women. Madame Walker’s aggressive marketing strategy combined with relentless ambition led her to be labeled as the first known African-American woman to become a self-made millionaire.    Having amassed a fortune in fifteen years, this pioneering businesswoman died at the age of 52. Her prescription for success was perseverance, hard work, faith in herself and in God, ""honest business dealings"" and of course, quality products. ""There is no royal flower-strewn path to success,"" she once observed. ""And if there is, I have not found it - for if I have accomplished anything in life it is because I have been willing to work hard.""     Improved Permanent Wave Machine  An employee of Madame CJ Walker’s empire,  Marjorie Joyner  invented an improved permanent wave machine. This device patented in 1928, curled or ""permed"" women’s hair for a relatively lengthy period of time. The wave machine was popular among women white and black allowing for longer-lasting wavy hair styles. Joyner went on to become a prominent figure in Madame CJ Walker’s industry, though she never profited directly from her invention, the assigned intellectual property of the Walker Company.      Madame Walker on Herself  ""I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations.

clueweb09-en0004-15-30534	"       C. J. Walker     1867-1919           Nationality  -  African   American    Occupation  -  Entrepreneur, Philanthropist, Social Activist   Also Known As:  Sarah Breedlove       Narrative Essay   As a manufacturer of hair care products for African American women, Madame C.J. Walker, born Sarah Breedlove (1867-1919), became one of the first American women millionaires.   Madame C.J. Walker, named Sarah Breedlove at birth, was born December 23, 1867, in Delta, Louisiana, to Owen and Minerva Breedlove, both of whom were emancipated slaves. The Breedloves worked as sharecroppers on a cotton plantation. At the age of six Sarah was orphaned, and in 1878, after the cotton crop failed and a yellow fever epidemic struck, the young girl moved to Vicksburg to live with her sister Louvinia and to work as a domestic. She worked hard from the time that she was very young, suffered great poverty, and had little opportunity to get an education. In order to escape the oppressive environment created by Louvinia's husband, Sarah married Moses McWilliams when she was only fourteen years old. At eighteen she gave birth to a daughter she named Lelia, and at twenty she was widowed.   Sarah then decided to move to St. Louis, where she worked as a laundress and in other domestic positions for eighteen years, joined St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church, and put her daughter through the public schools and Knoxville College. Sarah, who was barely literate, was especially proud of her daughter's educational accomplishments.   By the time she was in her late thirties, Sarah was contending with hair loss because of a combination of stress and damaging hair care products. After experimenting with various methods, she developed a formula of her own that caused her hair to grow again quickly. She often recounted that after praying about her hair, she was given the formula in a dream. When friends and family members noticed how Sarah's hair grew back, they began to ask her to duplicate her product for them. She began to prepare her formula at home, selling it to friends and family and marketing it door to door.   With the help of her family and her second husband, Charles Joseph Walker, a newspaperman whom she had married in 1906 after she moved to Denver, she began to advertise a growing number of hair care products. She also adopted her husband's initials and surname as her professional name, calling herself Madam C.J. Walker for the rest of her life, even after the marriage ended. Her husband helped her develop mail marketing techniques for her products, usually through the medium of African American-owned newspapers. When their small business was successful, with earnings of about $10 a day, Walker felt that she should continue to expand, but her husband felt that she was too ambitious. Rather than allow her husband's wishes to restrain her, the couple separated.   Walker's business continued to develop, as she not only marketed her hair care products but also tutored African American men and women in their use, recruiting a group called ""Walker Agents."" Her products were often used in conjunction with a metal comb that was heated on the stove and used to straighten very curly hair. She also began to manufacture a facial skin cream. The hair process was controversial because many felt that African American women should wear their hair in natural styles rather than attempt to change the texture from curly to straight. In spite of critics, Walker's hair care methods gained increasing popularity among African American women, who enjoyed products designed especially for them. This resulted in growing profits for Walker's business and an increasing number of agents who marketed the products for her door to door.   Working closely with her daughter Lelia (who later changed her name to A'Lelia), Walker opened a school for ""hair culturists"" in Pittsburgh--Lelia College--which operated from 1908 to 1910. In 1910 the Walkers moved to Indianapolis, where they established a modern factory to produce their products. They also began to hire African American professionals who could direct various aspects of their operation. Among the workers were tutors who helped Walker get a basic education.   Walker traveled throughout the nation demonstrating her products, recruiting salespersons and practitioners, and encouraging African American entrepreneurs. Her rounds included conventions of African American organizations, churches, and civic groups. Not content with her domestic achievements, Walker traveled to the Caribbean and Latin America to promote her business and to recruit individuals to teach her hair care methods. Observers estimated that Walker's company had about three thousand agents for whom Walker held annual conventions where they were tutored in product use, hygienic care techniques, and marketing strategies. She also gave cash awards to those who were most successful in promoting sales.   At A'Lelia's urging, Walker purchased property in New York City in 1913, with the belief that a base in that city would be important. In 1916 she moved to a luxurious townhouse she had built in Harlem, and a year later to a posh estate called Villa Lewaro she had constructed at Irvington-on-Hudson, New York.   Although Walker and her daughter lived lavishly, they carefully managed each aspect of their business, whose headquarters remained in Indianapolis, and gave to a number of philanthropic organizations. According to rumor, Walker's first husband was lynched. Perhaps it was partially for this reason that Walker supported anti-lynching legislation and gave generously to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, eventually willing that organization her estate in Irvington-on-Hudson. The Walkers generously supported religious, educational, charitable, and civil rights organizations.   Although cautioned by her doctors that her fast-paced life was impairing her health, Walker did not heed the warnings. On May 25, 1919, when she was 51 years old, she died of hypertension. Her funeral service was held in Mother Zion African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in New York City. Renowned African American educator Mary McLeod Bethune delivered the eulogy, and Walker was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. Her daughter, A'Lelia, succeeded her as president of the Madame C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company.   Sources    Many articles, biographical sketches, and juvenile books have been written about Walker (sometimes called madam), including a comprehensive biography,  On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C.J. Walker  by her great-great granddaughter, A'Lelia Bundles. Bundles' children's book is entitled  Madam C.J. Walker  (1991). Other books for youths are Penny Colman,  Madam C.J.

Walker          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Sarah Breedlove )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                       Madam Walker in a photograph ca. 1914 by  Addison Scurlock .       Madam C.J. Walker  ( December 23 ,  1867    May 25 ,  1919 ) was an  American   businesswoman ,  hair care   entrepreneur ,  tycoon  and  philanthropist . She died after World War I.   Her fortune was made by developing and marketing a hugely successful line of beauty and hair products for black women, under the company she founded Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company. The  Guinness Book of Records  cites Walker as the first female who became a  millionaire  by her own achievements.   In  2002 , scholar  Molefi Kete Asante  listed Madam C. J. Walker on his list of  100 Greatest African Americans . [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Biography   2   See also   3   References   4   Further reading   5   External links               Biography   She was born Sarah Breedlove in  Delta, Louisiana , the first member of her family to be born free. Her parents had been slaves. At age 14, she married a man named Moses McWilliams and was widowed at age 20. She then moved to  St. Louis, Missouri  to join her brothers. Sarah worked as a laundress for as little as a dollar and a half a day, but she was able to save enough to educate her daughter. While living in St. Louis, she joined  St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church , which helped develop her speaking, interpersonal and organizational skills. She was married in 1894 to John Davis and divorced about nine years later.   When she began to lose her hair, she had the idea for a line of hair care products. Like that of most other Americans in the early 1900s, Walker's home lacked indoor plumbing, electricity and central heating. Like many women of that era, she washed her hair only once a month. As a result, she suffered from severe  dandruff  and scalp disease that nearly caused her to go bald.   In 1905, Davis moved to  Denver, Colorado , where she worked as a sales agent for Annie Malone, another black woman entrepreneur who manufactured hair care products. Sarah also consulted with a Denver pharmacist, who analyzed Malone's formula and helped Walker formulate her own products. In addition, she often told reporters that the ingredients for her ""Wonderful Hair Grower"" had come to her in a dream.   In 1906 she married Charles Joseph Walker, a St. Louis newspaperman, and changed her name to ""Madam C.J. Walker"". She founded the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company to sell hair care products and  cosmetics . Madam Walker divorced Walker in 1910 and moved her growing manufacturing operations from St. Louis to a new industrial complex in  Indianapolis . By 1917 she had the largest business in the  United States  owned by a black person.          I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations...I have built my own factory on my own ground. [ 2 ]                 There is no royal, flower-strewn path to success. And if there is, I have not found it for if I have accomplished anything in life, it is because I have been willing to work hard. [ 2 ]          Walker saw her personal wealth not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote economic opportunities for others, especially black people. She took great pride in the profitable employment  and alternative to domestic labor  that her company afforded many thousands of black women who worked as commissioned agents. Her agents could earn from $5 to $15 per day in an era when unskilled white laborers were making about $11 per week. [ 3 ]   Marjorie Joyner , who started work as one of her employees, went on to lead the next generation of African-American beauty entrepreneurs.   Walker was known for her philanthropy, leaving two-thirds of her estate to educational institutions and charities, including the  NAACP , the  Tuskegee Institute  and  Bethune-Cookman College . In 1919, her $5,000 pledge to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign was the largest gift the organization had ever received.   Walker had a mansion called "" Villa Lewaro "" built in the wealthy New York suburb of  Irvington on Hudson, New York , near the estates of  John D. Rockefeller  and  Jay Gould . She spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furnishings. [ 4 ]  The  Italianate   villa  was designed by architect  Vertner Tandy , the first registered black  architect  in the state of New York, in 1915. Walker also owned townhouses in  Indianapolis  and New York.   Madam Walker died on May 25, 1919, at age 51, at her estate  Villa Lewaro . She passed away because of kidney failure and other complications resulting from  hypertension . She was buried at  Woodlawn Cemetery  in  the Bronx .   Her daughter  A'Lelia Walker  carried on the tradition of hospitality, opening her mother's home and her own to writers and artists of the emergent  Harlem Renaissance . She promoted important members of that movement. [ 5 ]  She converted a section of her  Harlem  townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street into the Dark Tower, a salon and tearoom where Harlem and  Greenwich Village  artists, writers and musicians gathered. Poet  Langston Hughes  called her ""The joy goddess of Harlem's 1920s"" in his autobiography  The Big Sea , because of the lavish parties she hosted in Harlem and  Irvington .

J. Walker, was              born into a former-slave family to parents Owen and Minerva Breedlove. She              had one older sister, Louvenia and brothers Alexander, James, Solomon and Owen, Jr.  Her parents had been slaves on Robert              W. Burney's Madison Parish farm which was a battle-staging area during              the Civil War for General Ulysses S. Grant and his Union troops. She              became an orphan at age 7 when her parents died during an epidemic              of yellow fever. To escape the epidemic and failing cotton crops,              the ten year old Sarah and her sister moved across the river to Vicksburg              in 1878 and obtained work as maids. At the age of fourteen, Sarah              married Moses McWilliams to escape her sister's abusive husband. They              had a daughter, Lelia (later known as A'Lelia Walker, a central figure              in the Harlem Renaissance). When Lelia was only two years old, McWilliams              died.  Sarah's second marriage to John Davis August 11, 1894              failed and ended sometime in 1903. She married for the third time              in January, 1906 to newspaper sales agent, Charles Joseph Walker;               they divorced around 1910.                                             ACCOMPLISHMENTS: Madam                    Walker was an entrepreneur who built her empire developing hair                    products for black women. She claims to have built her company                    on an actual dream where a large black man appeared to her and                    gave her a formula for curing baldness. When confronted with                    the idea that she was trying to conform black women's hair to                    that of whites, she stressed that her products were simply an                    attempt to help black women take proper care of their hair and                    promote its growth.                   Illustration                    courtesy of the                    A'Lelia Bundles/Walker Family Collection                     may not be reproduced without  permission                                                       Madam Walker was quite the business woman. Her third              husband, Charles Joseph Walker and her daughter Lelia had key roles              in the growth and day-to-day operations of the business. In September,              1906 Madam Walker and her husband toured the country promoting their              products and training sales agents while Lelia ran a mail-order operation              from Denver. From 1908 to 1910 they operated a beauty training school,              the Lelia College for Walker Hair Culturists, in Pittsburgh.               In 1910 they  moved the central operations to Indianapolis, then              the country's largest manufacturing base, to utilize that city's access              to eight major railway systems. At this height of success, Madam Walker              gathered a group of key principals to run the company, and she and              her husband divorced.   She became an inspiration to many black              women. Fully recognizing the power of her wealth and              success she lectured to promote her business which              in turn empowered other women in business.  She              gave lectures on black issues at conventions sponsored              by powerful black institutions. She also encouraged              black Americans to support the cause of World War              I and worked to have black veterans granted full respect.             After the bloody East St. Louis Race              Riot of 1917, Madam Walker devoted herself to having              lynching made a federal crime. In 1918 she was the              keynote speaker at many National Association for the              Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) fund raisers              for the anti-lynching effort throughout the Midwest              and East. She was honored later that summer by the              National Association of Colored Women (NACW) for making              the largest contribution to saving the home of abolitionist              Frederick Douglass. She donated large sums of              money to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign and later              in her life revised her will to support black schools,              organizations, individuals, orphanages, retirement              homes, as well as YWCAs and YMCAs.             Madam Walker's home, Villa Lewaro, was              built in August of 1918 on Irvington-on-Hudson, New              York. Her neighbors included industrialists Jay Gould              and John D. Rockefeller. The grand estate served not              only as her home but as a conference center for summits              of race leaders to discuss current issues.             Madam Walker died at Villa Lewaro at the age of 51 on              Sunday, May 25, 1919 from complications of hypertension. Upon her              death she was considered to be the wealthiest African-American woman              in America and known to be the first African-American woman millionaire.               Some sources cite her as the first self-made American woman millionaire.              Her daughter Lelia succeeded her as president of the C. J. Walker              Manufacturing Company.

J. Walker   was born on December 23, 1867 in Delta, Louisiana, the daughter of Owen and Minerva Breedlove. Her parents were former slaves working as sharecroppers and both died when Sarah was a child. As a result, Sarah was forced to move from one household to another. At age seven, she moved in with her sister Louvina and her husband. After suffering abuse from Louvina's husband, Sarah ran away and married Moses McWilliams when she was 14 years old. In 1885, she gave birth to their daughter Lelia. Two years later, Moses was murdered by a White lynch mob.                                                                       After this tragedy, Sarah moved with her daughter to St. Louis, Missouri where she worked as a cook and housecleaner. Unfortunately, all of the stress and hardship had begun to take its toll on her and she found her hair falling out. She tried several products which claimed would help her condition but to no avail. At this point Sarah had a dream in which a "" big Black man appeared to me and told me what to mix up for my hair. Some of the remedy was grown in Africa, but I sent for it, put it on my scalp, and in a few weeks my hair was coming in faster than it had ever fallen out ."" After she shared her formula with some friends and found it successful for them as well, she realized that there were almost no hair products available for Blacks. She therefore decided to go into business, selling hair products to Black women.                                                   In 1905 Sarah's brother died and she moved to Denver, Colorado to live with her sister-in-law. When she arrived in Denver she had only $2.00 in her pocket yet she worked during the day as a cook in order to finance her part time business. At this point she met Charles Joseph ""C.J."" Walker, a newspaperman with an innate ability for marketing. She married Walker on January 4, 1906 and the couple set up the ""Madam CJ Walker Manufacturing Company"" and began placing advertisements in Black newspapers throughout the United States. Although they proved a successful team, they disagreed as to how much the company should grow. After years of struggling and suffering, Sarah wanted her company to grow immensely and divorced him in order to devote herself to the business (he stayed on as a sales agent for the company.). She continued on with many of the ideas he had passed on to her, including going door-to-door to sell the products. Her hard work paid off and in 1906 she brought her daughter Lelia, a recent college graduate, in to manage the company.             While Lelia ran            much of the company, Sarah traveled across the country and throughout            Latin America and the Caribbean marketing the products and developing            new ones. She also sought to bring more women into the company, desiring            to empower them and give them a way of rising above the constraints            set by a male dominated society.           In 1908, Sarah            started Lelia College in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which trained women            to sell her products door-to-door and by 1910 had more than 1,000 sales            agents. In that year, she moved the company's headquarters to Indianapolis,            Indiana and soon the company grew beyond anyone's expectations. By 1914,            the woman who only nine years earlier had only $2.00 to her name was            now worth more than one million dollars. Her products ranged from hair            conditioners and facial creams to hot combs specially made for the hair            of Black consumers.                                                   After            her early suffering and poverty plagued existence, Sarah McWilliams had            looked for a way out and as Madame C.J. Walker was able to purchase a            34 room mansion built off of the Hudson River in New York. When she died            on May 25, 1919, she was mourned throughout the Black community as a pioneer            and a Black industrialist. For many women, White and Black, however, she          had served as an inspiration and a role model.                                             Search  for more Information on  Madame C. J.

Walker )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                       Madam Walker in a photograph ca. 1914 by  Addison Scurlock .       Madam C.J. Walker  ( December 23 ,  1867    May 25 ,  1919 ) was an  American   businesswoman ,  hair care   entrepreneur ,  tycoon  and  philanthropist . She died after World War I.   Her fortune was made by developing and marketing a hugely successful line of beauty and hair products for black women, under the company she founded Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company. The  Guinness Book of Records  cites Walker as the first female, black or white, who became a  millionaire  by her own achievements.   In  2002 , scholar  Molefi Kete Asante  listed Madam C. J. Walker on his list of  100 Greatest African Americans . [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Biography   2   See also   3   References   4   Further reading   5   External links               Biography   She was born Sarah Breedlove in  Delta, Louisiana , the first member of her family to be born free. Her parents had been slaves. At age 14, she married a man named Moses McWilliams and was widowed at age 20. She then moved to  St. Louis, Missouri  to join her brothers. Sarah worked as a laundress for as little as a dollar and a half a day, but she was able to save enough to educate her daughter. While living in St. Louis, she joined  St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church , which helped develop her speaking, interpersonal and organizational skills. She was married in 1894 to John Davis and divorced about nine years later.   When she began to lose her hair, she had the idea for a line of hair care products. Like that of most other Americans in the early 1900s, Walker's home lacked indoor plumbing, electricity and central heating. Like many women of that era, she washed her hair only once a month. As a result, she suffered from severe  dandruff  and scalp disease that nearly caused her to go bald.   In 1905, Davis moved to  Denver, Colorado , where she worked as a sales agent for Annie Malone, another black woman entrepreneur who manufactured hair care products. Sarah also consulted with a Denver pharmacist, who analyzed Malone's formula and helped Walker formulate her own products. In addition, she often told reporters that the ingredients for her ""Wonderful Hair Grower"" had come to her in a dream.   In 1906 she married Charles Joseph Walker, a St. Louis newspaperman, and changed her name to ""Madam C.J. Walker"". She founded the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company to sell hair care products and  cosmetics . Madam Walker divorced Walker in 1910 and moved her growing manufacturing operations from St. Louis to a new industrial complex in  Indianapolis . By 1917 she had the largest business in the  United States  owned by a black person.          I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations...I have built my own factory on my own ground. [ 2 ]                 There is no royal, flower-strewn path to success. And if there is, I have not found it for if I have accomplished anything in life, it is because I have been willing to work hard. [ 2 ]          Walker saw her personal wealth not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote economic opportunities for others, especially black people. She took great pride in the profitable employment  and alternative to domestic labor  that her company afforded many thousands of black women who worked as commissioned agents. Her agents could earn from $5 to $15 per day in an era when unskilled white laborers were making about $11 per week. [ 3 ]   Marjorie Joyner , who started work as one of her employees, went on to lead the next generation of African-American beauty entrepreneurs.   Walker was known for her philanthropy, leaving two-thirds of her estate to educational institutions and charities, including the  NAACP , the  Tuskegee Institute  and  Bethune-Cookman College . In 1919, her $5,000 pledge to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign was the largest gift the organization had ever received.   Walker had a mansion called "" Villa Lewaro "" built in the wealthy New York suburb of  Irvington on Hudson, New York , near the estates of  John D. Rockefeller  and  Jay Gould . She spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furnishings. [ 4 ]  The  Italianate   villa  was designed by architect  Vertner Tandy , the first registered black  architect  in the state of New York, in 1915. Walker also owned townhouses in  Indianapolis  and New York.   Madam Walker died on May 25, 1919, at age 51, at her estate  Villa Lewaro . She passed away because of kidney failure and other complications resulting from  hypertension . She was buried at  Woodlawn Cemetery  in  the Bronx .   Her daughter  A'Lelia Walker  carried on the tradition of hospitality, opening her mother's home and her own to writers and artists of the emergent  Harlem Renaissance . She promoted important members of that movement. [ 5 ]  She converted a section of her  Harlem  townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street into the Dark Tower, a salon and tearoom where Harlem and  Greenwich Village  artists, writers and musicians gathered. Poet  Langston Hughes  called her ""The joy goddess of Harlem's 1920s"" in his autobiography  The Big Sea , because of the lavish parties she hosted in Harlem and  Irvington .

Madam C.J. Walker  ( December 23 ,  1867    May 25 ,  1919 ) was an  American   businesswoman ,  hair care   entrepreneur ,  tycoon  and  philanthropist . She died after World War I.   Her fortune was made by developing and marketing a hugely successful line of beauty and hair products for black women, under the company she founded Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company. The  Guinness Book of Records  cites Walker as the first female who became a  millionaire  by her own achievements.   In  2002 , scholar  Molefi Kete Asante  listed Madam C. J. Walker on his list of  100 Greatest African Americans . [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Biography   2   See also   3   References   4   Further reading   5   External links               Biography   She was born Sarah Breedlove in  Delta, Louisiana , the first member of her family to be born free. Her parents had been slaves. At age 14, she married a man named Moses McWilliams and was widowed at age 20. She then moved to  St. Louis, Missouri  to join her brothers. Sarah worked as a laundress for as little as a dollar and a half a day, but she was able to save enough to educate her daughter. While living in St. Louis, she joined  St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church , which helped develop her speaking, interpersonal and organizational skills. She was married in 1894 to John Davis and divorced about nine years later.   When she began to lose her hair, she had the idea for a line of hair care products. Like that of most other Americans in the early 1900s, Walker's home lacked indoor plumbing, electricity and central heating. Like many women of that era, she washed her hair only once a month. As a result, she suffered from severe  dandruff  and scalp disease that nearly caused her to go bald.   In 1905, Davis moved to  Denver, Colorado , where she worked as a sales agent for Annie Malone, another black woman entrepreneur who manufactured hair care products. Sarah also consulted with a Denver pharmacist, who analyzed Malone's formula and helped Walker formulate her own products. In addition, she often told reporters that the ingredients for her ""Wonderful Hair Grower"" had come to her in a dream.   In 1906 she married Charles Joseph Walker, a St. Louis newspaperman, and changed her name to ""Madam C.J. Walker"". She founded the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company to sell hair care products and  cosmetics . Madam Walker divorced Walker in 1910 and moved her growing manufacturing operations from St. Louis to a new industrial complex in  Indianapolis . By 1917 she had the largest business in the  United States  owned by a black person.          I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations...I have built my own factory on my own ground. [ 2 ]                 There is no royal, flower-strewn path to success. And if there is, I have not found it for if I have accomplished anything in life, it is because I have been willing to work hard. [ 2 ]          Walker saw her personal wealth not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote economic opportunities for others, especially black people. She took great pride in the profitable employment  and alternative to domestic labor  that her company afforded many thousands of black women who worked as commissioned agents. Her agents could earn from $5 to $15 per day in an era when unskilled white laborers were making about $11 per week. [ 3 ]   Marjorie Joyner , who started work as one of her employees, went on to lead the next generation of African-American beauty entrepreneurs.   Walker was known for her philanthropy, leaving two-thirds of her estate to educational institutions and charities, including the  NAACP , the  Tuskegee Institute  and  Bethune-Cookman College . In 1919, her $5,000 pledge to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign was the largest gift the organization had ever received.   Walker had a mansion called "" Villa Lewaro "" built in the wealthy New York suburb of  Irvington on Hudson, New York , near the estates of  John D. Rockefeller  and  Jay Gould . She spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furnishings. [ 4 ]  The  Italianate   villa  was designed by architect  Vertner Tandy , the first registered black  architect  in the state of New York, in 1915. Walker also owned townhouses in  Indianapolis  and New York.   Madam Walker died on May 25, 1919, at age 51, at her estate  Villa Lewaro . She passed away because of kidney failure and other complications resulting from  hypertension . She was buried at  Woodlawn Cemetery  in  the Bronx .   Her daughter  A'Lelia Walker  carried on the tradition of hospitality, opening her mother's home and her own to writers and artists of the emergent  Harlem Renaissance . She promoted important members of that movement. [ 5 ]  She converted a section of her  Harlem  townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street into the Dark Tower, a salon and tearoom where Harlem and  Greenwich Village  artists, writers and musicians gathered. Poet  Langston Hughes  called her ""The joy goddess of Harlem's 1920s"" in his autobiography  The Big Sea , because of the lavish parties she hosted in Harlem and  Irvington .

[ 1 ]  It premiered on September 19, 1994 and has been aired on Thursday nights at 10:00 for its entire run. On April 2, 2008, NBC announced that the series will return for its 15th, concluding season. [ 2 ]  Originally scheduled to run for 19 episodes before retiring with a two-hour series finale to be broadcast on March 12, 2009, [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  NBC recently announced it will extend  ER  by an additional three episodes to a full 22 episode order as part of a deal to launch a new series by John Wells. [ 5 ]  ER's final episode is scheduled to air on April 2, 2009 with a one-hour retrospective preceding it. [ 6 ]     History and production   In 1974, author  Michael Crichton  wrote a screenplay based on his own experiences as a medical resident in a busy ER. The screenplay went nowhere, and Crichton focused on other topics. In 1990, he published the novel  Jurassic Park , and in 1993 began a collaboration with director  Steven Spielberg  on the  film adaptation  of that. The Crichton-Spielberg team then returned to  ER  but decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film. Spielberg's  Amblin Entertainment  provided  John Wells  as the show's executive producer.   The script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in  1974 . The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 made the Dr. Lewis character a woman and the Dr. Benton character an African-American, and shortened the running time by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV. [ 7 ]   Due to a lack of time and money to build a set, the pilot episode of  ER  was filmed in the former  Linda Vista Community Hospital  in Los Angeles, an old facility that ceased operating as a medical center in 1990. [ 8 ]  A set modeled after Los Angeles County General Hospital's emergency room was built soon after at the  Warner Bros.  studios in  Burbank, California , although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city's famous  ""L""  train platforms.   ER  premiered on Monday, September 19, 1994 from 9:00-11:00 p.m. (EDT) and moved into the 10:00 p.m Thursday night timeslot three days later, where it remained for all fifteen seasons. Steven Spielberg left the show after one year in a producer's chair, but he made one critical decision with lasting effects: the Carol Hathaway character, who died at the end of the original script for the pilot episode, was retained.   ER  was filmed in 1.78:1  widescreen  from the start, even though it was not broadcast in widescreen until the seventh season when it began appearing in the  1080i  HD format where NBC was being broadcast digitally. [ citation needed ]  Since the sixth episode of Season 7, it has appeared in  letterbox  format when in standard definition. As a result, every US DVD box set shows the widescreen versions of the episodes, including those episodes originally broadcast in 1.33:1 (full screen) format. The episodes also appear in 1080i widescreen when rerun on  TNT HD , though the first six seasons still show in fullscreen on the digital  TNT  network. Only the live episode ""Ambush"" at the beginning of the fourth season, and the opening credits for the first six seasons, are in standard 4:3 aspect ratio.     Episodes       Main article:  List of ER episodes       ER  has had many memorable episodes, and is particularly notable for broadcasting a live episode, ""Ambush,"" in 1997, with the NBC camera crew disguised as a  PBS  crew making a documentary film in the hospital. The actors performed the show again three hours later so that the  West Coast  airing would be live as well. This episode received  Emmy Award  nominations for Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic), and won the Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Series.   Most episodes center on the ER, with almost all scenes at the hospital. There is, however, often at least one scene showing the goings-on of the ER staff outside the hospital. Also, there is a tradition to feature storylines each season completely outside of the ER. One early such instance involved a road trip near Las Vegas, Nevada (Drs. Ross and Greene). Season Eight included a storyline in Hawaii (Drs. Greene and Corday). More recently, the series has included storylines in Democratic Republic of Congo (Drs. Kovac and Carter) and Darfur, Sudan (Drs. Pratt and Carter, with Noah Wyle appearing as a guest star in the season following his departure from the show).     Cast     Main cast   The original cast consisted of  Anthony Edwards  as Dr. Mark Greene,  George Clooney  as Dr. Doug Ross,  Sherry Stringfield  as Dr. Susan Lewis,  Noah Wyle  as John Carter, and  Eriq La Salle  as Dr. Peter Benton.  Julianna Margulies  guest starred in the pilot as Carol Hathaway before becoming part of the regular cast. The first additions to the cast came in Season Two with Jeanie Boulet ( Gloria Reuben ) and Kerry Weaver ( Laura Innes ) signing on. The cast remained largely unchanged until Season Five, when  Kellie Martin  joined the cast as medical student Lucy Knight and  George Clooney  became the first major departure. As a result, Season Six opened with addition of then-unknown Croatian actor  Goran Visnjic  to the cast as the tragic Dr. Luka Kovac and soon after,  Maura Tierney  as Abby Lockhart, who together formed the series longest running, and most complicated, romantic relationship. By the end of Season Eight, only one member of the original cast,  Noah Wyle , remained. Wyle departed in Season Eleven, followed by  Laura Innes  in Season Thirteen, and finally  Maura Tierney  and  Goran Visnjic  in early Season Fifteen, ending the final connections to main body of the original cast.

[ 9 ]          Season 8 main cast         Continuity   Standard television contracts for principal characters posed a problem throughout the series run. The main result was the replacement of all principal characters from the pilot episode between Season Five (Doug Ross) and Season Twelve (John Carter). Writers and producers maintained continuity by frequently introducing new principals and by persuading actors to return for extra-contractual scenes after their characters' departures. The first of these scenes came at the end of Season Six, when George Clooney (as Doug Ross) is seen briefly in the final appearance of the Carol Hathaway character. The next of these scenes came at the end of Season Eight when Eriq La Salle (as Peter Benton) and Michael Michele (as Cleo Finch) are seen briefly at Mark Greene's funeral. More recent scenes have included guest appearances by Sharif Atkins in Seasons Eleven and Twelve, Noah Wyle in Season Twelve, and Gloria Reuben in Season Fourteen, leading to a series of guest appearances in Season Fifteen by some of the former cast, including Shane West, Anthony Edwards, Laura Innes, Paul McCrane, Alex Kingston, and longtime supporting actors Abraham Benrubi and William H. Macy.   Continuity has also been maintained by the frequent appearances of secondary characters such as Nurses Haleh Adams, Lily Jarvik, Malik McGrath, and Chuni Marquez (played by Yvette Freeman, Lily Mariye, Deezer D, and Laura Ceron, respectively) and Paramedics Dwight Zadro (Mont Russell) and Doris Pickman (Emily Wagner).   Finally, Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver) and Paul McCrane (Robert Romano) have regularly returned to the set of ER as directors, most recently in the Season 15 episode ""Age of Innocence"" (McCrane) and the Season 14 episode ""Coming Home"" (Innes). Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton) is scheduled to direct the Season 15 episode ""The Family Man."" [ 10 ]     Main cast departures   Sherry Stringfield 's first departure on the show was in 1996, when her character,  Susan Lewis , moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in the Season 3 episode ""Union Station."" In 2001, Stringfield returned to the series, reprising her role of Dr. Lewis, in the Season 8 episode ""Never Say Never."" She departed again in the Season 12 premiere, ""Canon City."" This second departure was not depicted, but rather mentioned by character  Kerry Weaver  four episodes later in ""Wake Up,"" when she explains that Susan had accepted a tenure-track position at a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa, after having been denied tenure at County.   After playing  Anna Del Amico  for one season,  Maria Bello  was not a part of the ensemble cast when Season 5 began. Like  Susan Lewis 's second exit, her character's departure was mentioned but not depicted; in the season premiere, ""Day for Knight,""  Carter  explains to new medical student  Lucy Knight  that the locker she is inheriting used to belong to Anna Del Amico, who is working in a pediatric ER back in Philadelphia, where she has family and a boyfriend.   George Clooney  left the show in 1999, in the Season 5 episode ""The Storm, Part 2,"" when his character,  Doug Ross , quit before being fired by County for his involvement in a patient's death. Clooney returned in the season 6 episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow"" in a cameo when his character reunited with  Carol Hathaway .   Gloria Reuben  departed early in Season 6, in the episode ""The Peace of Wild Things,"" when her character,  Jeanie Boulet , decided to become a stay-at-home mom and care for her newly adopted HIV-positive baby. Reuben returned in the season 14 episode ""Status Quo"" with her HIV positive child.   Kellie Martin , who played medical student  Lucy Knight , left the series midway through Season 6 in the episode ""All In The Family,"" when her character was killed by a patient suffering from undiagnosed  schizophrenia ; his  psychotic break  occurred before a backed-up psychiatry department could arrive in the ER for a consult.   Julianna Margulies  left the show at the end of Season 6, in the episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow,"" when her character,  Carol Hathaway , decided on the spur of the moment to go to Seattle, Washington, and reunite with  Doug Ross , her true love and the father of her twin daughters.   Erik Palladino  departed early in Season 8, in the episode (""Never Say Never"") after his character,  Dave Malucci , was fired for inappropriate conduct.   Eriq La Salle 's character,  Peter Benton , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". He took a job with a set schedule at another hospital in order to spend more time with his son, Reese, and his girlfriend, former fellow ER doctor  Cleo Finch . La Salle returned in the season 8 episodes ""It's All in Your Head"" in a cameo to speak with Elizabeth Corday and ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Michael Michele 's character,  Cleo Finch , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" with her boyfriend, and fellow doctor,  Peter Benton , after having previously taken a job at the same hospital with set schedules (in fact it was she who arranged the interview which resulted in Benton's job offer). Michele returned in the season 8 episode ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Anthony Edwards 's character,  Mark Greene , died of a brain tumor in Season 8's penultimate episode, ""On the Beach."" Unusually, Anthony Edwards was credited in the following episode ""Lockdown"". Edwards returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" where he appeared in multiple flashback scenes to give insight into the past of Angela Bassett's character. [ 11 ]   Paul McCrane 's character,  Robert Romano , whose arm had been severed just above the elbow by a helicopter's tail rotor in the Season 9 premiere ""Chaos Theory,"" was killed in the Season 10 episode ""Freefall"" when a helicopter that was taking off from the hospital roof was buffeted by strong winds, causing it to crash on the roof and plummet over the side of the building; it fell into a crowded ambulance bay and landed squarely on Romano. McCrane returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Sharif Atkins  left the series in the Season 10 episode ""Where There's Smoke,"" when his character,  Michael Gallant , revealed that the Army was sending him to Iraq. Atkins returned in the Season 11 episodes ""Here and There"" and ""Back in the World"" in several scenes taking place in Iraq and then again in the season 12 episodes ""Two Ships,"" ""I Do,"" ""Split Decisions,"" and ""The Gallant Hero and The Tragic Victor"" where he married Neela and then returned to Iraq where he was killed by an  improvised explosive device  while serving a second tour there.   Alex Kingston 's character,  Elizabeth Corday , left the series in the Season 11 episode ""Fear"" after getting in trouble for performing an illegal organ donation procedure; rather than being summarily fired, County offered her a demotion to a non-tenured position, but she turned it down and opted to return to England instead. In an interview with Britain's  Radio Times  magazine, Kingston spoke of being written off the show due to her age, a statement that sparked some controversy. She later withdrew that claim. [ 12 ]  Kingston returned in the 15th season episode ""Dream Runner"" in two of Neela's dream sequences. [ 13 ]   Ming-Na  left in Season 11 as an attending physician when her character,  Jing-Mei Chen , resigned in in order to take care of her ailing father, whom she later  euthanized  in the episode ""Twas the Night."" This was the second time her character left County General; in season 1, medical student ""Deb"" Chen recurred in an eight episode story arc which concluded with her leaving medical school after accidentally leaving a guide wire in a patient's chest and deciding she was better suited to do research than to do applied medicine.   Noah Wyle  left in the Season 11 finale, ""The Show Must Go On."" His character,  John Carter , after having received tenure at County, decided to reunite with his girlfriend  Kem Likasu  (portrayed by  Thandie Newton ). Wyle returned in the season 12 episodes ""Quintessence of Dust,"" ""Darfur,"" ""No Place to Hide,"" and ""There Are No Angels Here"" where he is practicing medicine in Darfur.   Laura Innes  left midway through Season 13, in the episode ""A House Divided,"" when a reluctant  Luka Kova  was forced by budget cuts to fire her character,  Kerry Weaver . After bracing for a battle to keep her position, and in spite of the fact that Kova realized he must find a way to keep her on staff, Weaver ultimately decided to resign from County and accept a job offer from a television station in Miami, Florida. Innes returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Shane West  left at the end of the 13th season after his character,  Ray Barnett  lost both his legs and returned to Baton Rouge with his mother to recuperate. West's final appearance as a main cast member was in ""The Honeymoon is Over."" West returned in the 15th season episode ""Haunted"" to visit Neela and the rest of the staff.   Mekhi Phifer  departed during the first episode of Season 15. His character,  Gregory Pratt , died in the ER as the result of blast injuries suffered in an ambulance explosion in the final episode of Season 14.   Goran Visnjic  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with his TV wife Abby Lockhart. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  Luka had previously left the show in the season finale of season 13 when he left for Croatia to care for his ailing father. He returned for seven episodes in season 14 to wrap up his medical storyline and then made a brief appearance in ""Book of Abby"" where he, Abby, and their son Joe embark on their new life together.   Maura Tierney  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with her TV husband Luka Kovac. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  She attempted to leave the ER quietly, however the rest of the staff made it known how much they will miss her. Nurse Haleh Adams showed Abby a hidden wall with the locker labels of all the past staff members since season one, with the exception of Carter who refused to deface government property (the other names on the wall were mostly departed former characters as well as some prominent writers and producers). Abby then left the ER and met Luka and her son Joe outside where they embark on their new life together.

AP/Wide World Photos .        ■ Martha Stewart transformed a home-based catering business into a multibillion-dollar media franchise centered upon her image as a consummate hostess, food expert, and do-it-yourself decorator. A trusted tastemaker and icon of American domesticity, Stewart skillfully cultivated one of the most recognizable and powerful brands through her award-winning television program, best-selling magazine, and more than 20books on cooking, gardening, and home decor. In 1997 she founded Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, an umbrella company for her diverse publishing, television, online, and merchandising ventures. Stewart's credibility was tarnished in 2002 when she was indicted, and subsequently convicted, on four counts of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and making false statements to government investigators, bringing the future of her company into question.     EARLY LIFE, MODELING, AND MARRIAGE   The second of six children, Stewart was raised by her Polish-Catholic parents in a small, single-family home in Nutley, New Jersey, a working-class suburb near New York City. By all accounts Stewart's father was a strict disciplinarian who instilled in Stewart the value of self-sufficiency as well as a domineering perfectionism. Because of the family's modest means, Stewart and her siblings were required to perform various household chores, through which Stewart became adept at cooking, sewing, and gardening. Though acquiring these skills out of necessity, Stewart later embraced her former chores as hobbies and made a living by showing others how to parlay domestic know-how into evidence of refinement and the good life.   While in high school, Stewart began modeling for upscale department stores in New York City and subsequently appeared in several television commercials and fashion magazines. Intelligent as well as photogenic—traits that would propel her career as a media star—Stewart was offered a full scholarship to New York University but declined in order to attend Barnard College, where she studied art history while supporting herself through modeling. Stewart's modeling career was given a boost in 1961 when she was named by  Glamour  magazine as one of America's 10 best-dressed college students. Later that year she married Andrew Stewart, a student at Yale Law School. Stewart graduated from Barnard in 1963 and continued modeling in New York while her husband established his law career.   HIGH FINANCE TO HAUTE CUISINE   With the birth of her daughter in 1965, Stewart ceased modeling and decided to pursue an interest in Wall Street trading. Despite her lack of formal training, she landed a position as a stockbroker with Monness, Williams, and Sidel—a small firm at which she excelled and was energized by the sales environment and six-figure salary. Stewart's intuitive business sense and ambition were immediately apparent. However, an economic downturn in 1973 convinced Stewart to abandon high finance, leaving her temporarily unattached as she contemplated alternate career paths.   A year earlier the Stewarts had moved from New York to Westport, Connecticut, a bucolic suburb in which they purchased an old farm house on Turkey Hill Road. Stewart turned her boundless energy to renovating the dilapidated house that would become famous as Stewart's showpiece and base of business operations. During the mid-1970s Stewart began teaching cooking classes out of her home and taking on small catering jobs, through which she quickly established a word-of-mouth reputation for excellence.   In 1975 Stewart and Norma Collier cofounded the Uncatered Affair, a catering business that flourished despite tensions between Stewart and Collier, who resented Stewart's overbearing work style. Over time many of Stewart's business associates and employees would accuse her of being overly demanding, manipulative, and verbally abusive, presenting a seemingly irreconcilable foil to her public persona as a warm and charming hostess. While Stewart's lofty standards and meticulous attention to detail were keys to her success, they also incurred significant personal costs, including the breakup of her marriage in 1989.   After parting ways with Collier, Stewart was hired as the manager of Market Basket, a gourmet food court in a small Westport shopping mall, which she transformed into a booming success. Stewart simultaneously developed her own catering business, Martha Stewart Inc., impressing her celebrity and well-to-do clients with elegant menus and creative presentations that featured her homegrown ingredients and distinctive personal touch. Displaying a knack for self-promotion, Stewart enhanced her reputation by pitching stories about her work and home to local newspapers and by contributing occasional articles on food, gardening, and home decor to such national magazines as  Good Housekeeping, House Beautiful , and  Country Living .   RISE TO NATIONAL PROMINENCE   In 1979 Stewart received a $25,000 advance from Crown Publishing to write her first book,  Entertaining , hiring the free-lance writer Elizabeth Hawes to assist her. The finished product, a lavish cookbook and decorating guide embellished with photographs of Stewart's immaculate Turkey Hill home and table settings, was published in 1982. This best-selling book established Stewart's trademark aesthetic—genteel sophistication merged with casual intimacy and everyday practicality—and catapulted her into the media limelight with a national book tour, speaking appearances, and television interviews.   Over the next several years, Stewart published additional food books and a popular wedding planner that extended her name recognition and provided the foundation upon which the Martha Stewart ""brand"" was built. In 1986 she made her debut as a featured television hostess on ""Holiday Entertaining with Martha Stewart,"" a public television special in which she cheerfully prepared a sumptuous, home-cooked Thanksgiving dinner for her family. The success of the program, which Crown Publishing distributed as a mail-order video, encouraged Stewart to set her sights on additional television opportunities.   In 1987 Stewart signed a lucrative contract with the discount retailer Kmart to serve as the company's lifestyle consultant. While helping Kmart elevate its down-market image by endorsing and promoting an exclusive line of home products, Stewart received valuable national exposure through Kmart's expansive advertising campaign and attracted a growing following of admirers. A long-lasting and highly profitable relationship for Stewart, she continued to sell her popular ""Martha Stewart Everyday"" products in Kmart stores through 2004.   CREATING A MEDIA FRANCHISE   During the late 1980s Stewart sought to capitalize on her growing fame with a new lifestyle magazine based on the same entertaining and decorating concepts in her best-selling books. In 1990 she convinced Time Warner to publish the magazine  Martha Stewart Living , which was an instant success and paved the way for subsequent celebrity-based women's glossies, such as Oprah Winfrey's  O  and Rosie O'Donnell's  Rosie . The next year Stewart signed a 10-year contract with Time Warner for the magazine and spin-off television programs, videos, and books. Stewart's Time Warner deal also included regular appearances on the NBC morning program  The Today Show , which enlarged her fan base and provided a prominent cross-promotional platform for her publications.   Stewart's keen entrepreneurial instincts included an ability to understand the advantages of ""synergy,"" a business concept that became popular during the 1990s as such media corporations as Time Warner became increasingly consolidated. Synergy occurs as a product or line of products is marketed cooperatively across multiple advertising and media outlets so that the sum of the various outlets—for example, television, publishing, and retailing—provides greater marketing power than any one medium in isolation. In Stewart's case, her relationships with both Time Warner and Kmart provided opportunities for promoting her publications and products in interrelated news programs, television and magazine features, advertising campaigns, and sponsor tie-ins.   In 1993 Stewart launched a television version of her magazine, also titled  Martha Stewart Living , which was produced through a subsidiary of Time and syndicated throughout the country. The program initially aired as a weekly, half-hour series but was soon expanded into a daily, hour-long show as a result of its enormous popularity. With Stewart as the show's wholesome host, the series became one of the most watched morning programs among female viewers and earned several Emmy awards before it was discontinued in 2004.   In 1997 Stewart leveraged her profits from Kmart to buy back her magazine from Time Warner for an estimated $75 million. At the same time, she founded a new company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, over which she presided as chairman and chief executive officer. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia would serve as the parent company of her various media holdings, including  Martha Stewart Living  magazine and a series of derivative ""Best of Martha Stewart Living"" books; the spin-off magazines  Martha Stewart Weddings, Martha Stewart Kids , and  Food Everyday ; her television program, daily radio show, Web site, and syndicated newspaper column called ""Ask Martha""; and a mail-order catalog business, Martha by Mail.   Stewart caused a major stir on Wall Street when she took her company public in an initial public offering in October 1999. Stock prices for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia skyrocketed, and Stewart, owner of 60 percent of the company's shares, amassed paper assets worth more than $1 billion almost overnight. In 2000 Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia reported profits in excess of $21 million with annual sales of over $285 million. The company continued to grow and prosper over the next two years.   INDICTMENT AND PUBLIC FALL   In 2002 Stewart came under federal investigation for insider stock trading as a result of her suspicious sale of nearly four thousand shares of ImClone stocks on December 27, 2001, the day prior to a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcement declaring that a promising cancer drug produced by ImClone would not be considered for review. In light of the FDA decision, ImClone's stock price abruptly tumbled. Prosecutors for the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Stewart was acting on a tip from her stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic, who reported that ImClone CEO Sam Waksal, one of Stewart's close friends, was dumping his stock in the company. (Waksal subsequently pleaded guilty to six counts of insider trading.)   As a result of the investigation and the intensifying scandal, Stewart relinquished her seat on the board of directors of the New York Stock Exchange in late 2002. On June 4, 2003, Stewart and Bacanovic were officially indicted by a federal grand jury on nine counts of securities fraud, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy—serious criminal charges that carried prison sentences. Though vigorously denying the allegations and defending herself on her Web site and in a paid, full-page editorial in  USA Today , Stewart stepped down from her position as chairman and CEO of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia on the day of her indictment. She subsequently inserted herself into a newly created position, founding editorial director, from which she continued to head the company.   Amid a media frenzy, Stewart's trial began in a Manhattan courtroom on January 20, 2004. Stewart refused to testify but maintained her innocence throughout the proceedings, despite witness testimony as well as evidence of doctored documents suggesting foul play. Her prior experience as a stockbroker precluded the possibility of arguing that she was ignorant of trading regulations. On March 5, 2004, Stewart was convicted of four counts of obstruction of justice and lying to investigators. On July 16, 2004, Stewart was sentenced to five months in prison, followed by five months of house arrest. She remained free on bail pending an appeal.     IMPACT ON AMERICAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS   Stewart built a media empire and a world-class brand through her superior aesthetic sense and ability to present herself as a living embodiment of simple elegance. During the 1980s and 1990s her quick tips for fine cooking and better decorating appealed to many American women—traditional as well as professional and liberated women—who sought to emulate Stewart's gentrified version of modern homemaking. Instructing her audiences from the staged comfort of her renovated colonial home and beautifully maintained gardens, Stewart showed how sophisticated cuisine and understated home luxury were not the exclusive domain of upper-class New Englanders but were accessible to anyone willing to heed her recommendations. Stewart's judicious taste was encapsulated in her trademark epithet ""It's a good thing.""   Part of Stewart's business success can be attributed to her realization that she was selling not only products but also information. Her publications and television series were popular because the information Stewart provided was perceived as consistently reliable and useful by her audience. Moreover, she conjured an idealized home life that demonstrated how time-strapped, modern working women could have it all. In contrast to such staid predecessors as Betty Crocker and Julia Child, Stewart represented a thoroughly modern woman—smart, ambitious, and attractive—whose judgments on food, home decor, and style became the unofficial equivalent of the  Good Housekeeping  seal of approval. By distilling this authority into a powerful brand, Stewart was able to expand into new product lines—from paint to bedding to stationary—on the strength of her name and endorsement alone.   Despite her remarkable business accomplishments and rise as a major player in the male-dominated media industry, Stewart was often the subject of scorn and ridicule. Mocked for her cloying graciousness and condescending explanations of difficult recipes and projects that she performed with effortless perfection, she was also accused in numerous published accounts of displaying a cruel temper and brazen selfishness. It is worth noting, however, that criticism of Stewart's aggressive personality and tendency to micromanage her business suggested a double standard, as these same traits were often deemed praiseworthy in male executives. Stewart's complex identity as a business leader and celebrity had serious implications for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in the wake of her conviction. Because of Stewart's status as the irreplaceable core figure of the company, the fate of her media enterprises—and her own reputation as a pathbreaking entrepreneur—rested heavily upon her continuing popularity in the face of a notoriously fickle public.

For the film adaptation, see  The Music Man (1962 film) .  For other uses, see  Music Man .

The show is based on a story by Willson and Franklin Lacey. The plot concerns  con man  Harold Hill, who poses as a boys' band leader and sells band instruments and uniforms to naive townsfolk before skipping town with the cash. In River City,  Iowa , prim Marian the librarian sees through him, but when Hill helps her younger brother, Marian begins to fall in love with Harold. Harold, in turn falling for Marian, risks being caught to win her.   In 1957, the show became a hit on  Broadway , winning five  Tony Awards , including Best Musical, and running for 1,375 performances. The  cast album  won the first  Grammy Award  for ""Best Original Cast Album"". The show's success led to revivals and a popular 1962 film adaptation. It is still frequently produced by both professional and amateur theater companies.

[ 1 ]  He first approached producers  Cy Feuer  and Ernest Martin for a television special, and then  MGM  producer  Jesse L. Lasky . After these and other unsuccessful attempts, Willson invited Franklin Lacey to help him edit and simplify the libretto. At this time, Willson considered eliminating a long piece of dialogue about the serious trouble facing River City parents. Willson realized it sounded like a lyric, and transformed it into the now-famous song, ""Ya Got Trouble"". [ 2 ]   The character Marian Paroo was inspired by Marian Seeley of  Provo, Utah , who met Willson during  World War II , when Seeley was a medical records librarian. [ 3 ]  In the original production (and the film), the School Board was played by the 1950 International Quartet Champions of the  Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America  (SPEBSQSA), [ 4 ]  the  Buffalo Bills . Robert Preston claimed that he got the role of Harold Hill despite his limited singing range because, when he went to audition, they were having the men sing ""Trouble"". The producers felt it would be the most difficult song to sing, but with his acting background, it was the easiest for Preston. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Productions   After years of development, a change of producers, almost forty songs (twenty-two were cut), and more than forty drafts, the original  Broadway  production, directed by  Morton DaCosta  and  choreographed  by  Onna White , opened on  December 19 ,  1957  at the  Majestic Theatre . It won five  Tony awards , including Best Musical, even beating out  West Side Story . [ 5 ]  It remained at the Majestic for nearly three years before transferring to  The Broadway Theatre  to complete its 1,375-performance run. The original cast included  Robert Preston  (who went on to reprise his role in the  1962 screen adaptation ) as Harold Hill,  Barbara Cook  as Marian, and  Eddie Hodges  as Winthrop, with  Pert Kelton ,  David Burns  and  Iggie Wolfington  in supporting roles.  Eddie Albert  and  Bert Parks  each replaced Preston later in the run.   The  original cast recording  was released by  Capitol Records  on  January 20 ,  1958  in  stereophonic  &  monaural  versions and held the #1 spot on the  Billboard charts  for twelve weeks, remaining on the charts for a total of 245 weeks. The  cast album  was awarded ""Best Original Cast Album"" at the first  Grammy Awards  ceremony in 1958 and was inducted in 1998 as a Grammy Hall of Fame Award winner. [ 6 ]           Dick Van Dyke  on the 1980  Playbill       After eight previews, the first Broadway revival, directed and choreographed by  Michael Kidd , opened on  June 5 ,  1980 , at the  New York City Center , where it ran for 21 performances. The cast included  Dick Van Dyke  as Hill,  Meg Bussert  as Marian, and  Christian Slater  as Winthrop.   After twenty-two previews, the second Broadway revival, directed and choreographed by  Susan Stroman , opened on  April 27 ,  2000  at the  Neil Simon Theatre , where it ran for 699 performances. The cast included  Craig Bierko  (making his Broadway debut) as Hill and  Rebecca Luker  as Marian.  Robert Sean Leonard  and  Eric McCormack  portrayed Hill later in the run.   The success of the 2000 revival prompted a  2003 television movie  starring  Matthew Broderick  as Hill and  Kristin Chenoweth  as Marian, with  Victor Garber ,  Debra Monk , and  Molly Shannon  in supporting roles.   Willson recorded his trials and tribulations in getting the show to Broadway in his book  But He Doesn't Know The Territory .   In 2008, there was a revival of the show at the Chichester Festival Theatre, England. This starred Brian Conley as Hill and Scarlett Strallen as Marian. This opened to critical acclaim and was nominated for the Whatsonstage.com award for Best Regional Production.     [ edit ]   Synopsis     [ edit ]   Act One   On a train leaving  Rock Island ,  Illinois , Charlie Cowell and other travelling salesmen in the car begin a heated argument about credit (""Rock Island""). Charlie and another salesman tell the others about a  con man  known as ""Professor"" Harold Hill, whose scam is to convince parents he can teach their musically disinclined children to play musical instruments. He takes pre-paid orders for instruments and uniforms with the promise that he will form a band, and then he skips town, leaving the parents with the instruments on order, and moves on to the next one before he's exposed. The train arrives in River City,  Iowa , and a stranger on the train stands up and declares, ""Gentlemen, you intrigue me. I think I shall have to give Iowa a try."" He picks up his suitcase clearly labelled ""Professor Harold Hill"", and exits the train.   The townspeople of River City describe their reserved, ""chip-on-the-shoulder attitude"" ("" Iowa Stubborn ""). Marcellus, Harold's old friend, tells him that Marian Paroo, the librarian who gives piano lessons, is the only one in town who knows about music. Marcellus informs him that a new  pool table  was just delivered to the town's local  billiard parlor , and as a part of his scheme, Harold convinces River City parents ""that game with the fifteen numbered balls is the devil's tool"" (""Trouble""). Harold follows Marian home and flirts with her, but she pays no attention to him. At home, Marian gives a piano lesson to a little girl named Amaryllis while arguing with her mother, Mrs. Paroo, about her ""standards where men are concerned"" after telling Mrs. Paroo that a stranger followed her home (""Piano Lesson/If You Don't Mind My Saying So""). Marian's self-conscious,  lisping  younger brother Winthrop arrives home, and Amaryllis, who secretly likes him, asks Marian who she should say goodnight to on the evening star since she doesn't have a sweetheart. Marian tells her to just say goodnight to her ""someone"" (""Goodnight, My Someone"").   The next day is  Independence Day , and Mayor Shinn is leading the morning festivities in the high school gym, with the help of his wife, Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn (""Columbia, Gem of the Ocean""). Harold Hill interrupts the proceedings and announces to the townspeople that he will prevent ""sin and corruption"" from pool table by forming a boys' band. He soon excitedly leads them with "" Seventy-Six Trombones "". Mayor Shinn, who owns the billiard parlor, tells the bickering school board to get Harold's credentials, but Harold teaches them to sing as a  Barbershop Quartet  instead (""Ice Cream/Sincere""). Harold also sets up Zaneeta, the mayor's oldest girl, with Tommy Djilas, a boy from the wrong side of town, and persuades Tommy to become his assistant. Marian rejects Harold again, and he explains to Marcellus that ""The Sadder But Wiser Girl"" is the one he wants. The town ladies are very excited about the band and the ladies' dance committee Harold plans to form. He asks them about Marian, and they intimate to him that she had an inappropriate relationship with old miser Madison, who gave the town the library; they also warn Harold that she advocates dirty books (""Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little""). The school board arrives to collect Harold's credentials, but he leads them in singing ""Goodnight, Ladies"" and slips away.   The next day, Harold walks into the library, but Marian ignores him. He declares his unrequited love for her, leading the teenagers in the library in dance (""Marian the Librarian""). For a moment, Marian forgets her decorum and dances with Harold. He kisses her, and she tries to slap him. He ducks, and she hits Tommy Djilas instead. Harold signs up all the boys in town to be in his band, including Winthrop (""Gary, Indiana""). Mrs. Paroo likes Harold and tries to find out why Marian is not interested. Marian describes her ideal man (""My White Knight""). She tries to give Mayor Shinn evidence against Harold that she found in the Indiana State Educational Journal, but they are interrupted by the arrival of the ""The Wells Fargo Wagon"", which delivers the band instruments. When Winthrop forgets to be shy and self-conscious because he is so happy with his new  cornet , Marian begins to fall in love with Harold. She tears the incriminating page out of the Journal before giving the book to Mayor Shinn.     [ edit ]   Act Two   The ladies rehearse their classical dance in the school gym while the school board practices their quartet (""It's You"") for the  ice cream social . Marcellus and the town's teenagers interrupt the ladies' practice, taking over the gym as they dance the "" Shipoopi "". Harold grabs Marian to dance with her, and all the teenagers join in. Regarding Winthrop's cornet, Marian later questions Harold about his claim that ""you don't have to bother with the  notes "". He explains that this is what he calls ""The Think System"", and he arranges to call on Marian to discuss it. The town ladies ask Marian to join their dance committee, since she was ""so dear dancing the Shipoopi"" with Professor Hill (""Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little"" (reprise)). They have reversed their opinions about her books, and they eagerly tell her that ""the Professor told us to read those books, and we simply adored them all!""   That night, the school board tries to collect Harold's credentials again, but he gets them to begin singing ""Lida Rose"" and slips away. Marian, meanwhile, is sitting on her front porch thinking of Harold, and, in counterpoint, asks herself, ""Will I Ever Tell You?"". Winthrop returns home after spending time with Harold and tells Marian and Mrs. Paroo about Harold's hometown, "" Gary, Indiana "". As Marian waits alone for Harold, Charlie Cowell enters with evidence against Harold, hoping to tell Mayor Shinn. He has to leave on the next train, but stops to flirt with Marian. She tries to delay him so he doesn't have time to deliver the evidence, eventually kissing him. As the train whistle blows, she pushes him away. Charlie angrily tells Marian that Harold has a girl in ""every county in Illinois, and he's taken it from every one of them  and that's 102 counties!""   Harold arrives, and after he reminds her of the untrue rumors he's heard about her, she convinces herself that Charlie invented everything he told her. They agree to meet at the footbridge, where Marian tells him the difference he's made in her life ("" Till There Was You ""). Marcellus interrupts and tells Harold that the uniforms have arrived. He urges Harold to take the money and run, but Harold refuses to leave, insisting, ""I've come up through the ranks... and I'm not resigning without my commission"". He returns to Marian, who tells him that she knows he's a fraud, but she still loves him. He said he was a graduate of Gary Conservatory, Gold-Medal Class of '05, but the town wasn't even built until '06! Harold walks her home, and she sings ""Goodnight my Someone"" while he sings ""Seventy-Six Trombones"". Harold realizes that he is in love with Marian, and each sings the other's song.   Meanwhile, Charlie Cowell, who has missed his train, arrives at the ice cream social and denounces Harold Hill as a fraud. The townspeople begin an agitated search for Harold. Winthrop is heartbroken and tells Harold that he wishes Harold never came to River City. But Marian tells Winthrop that she believes everything Harold ever said, for it did come true in the way every kid in town talked and acted that summer. She and Winthrop urge Harold to get away. He chooses to stay and tells Marian that he never really fell in love ""Till There Was You"" (reprise) as the constable handcuffs Harold and leads him away.   Mayor Shinn is leading a meeting in the high school gym to decide what to do with Harold, asking, ""Where's the band? Where's the band?"" Tommy enters as a drum major, followed by the kids in uniform with their instruments. Marian urges Harold to lead the band, and when he does, he is rewarded with unanticipated redemption: uncritical parents marvel and cheer as the River City Boys' Band performs the  Minuet in G . The play ends as Harold is released into Marian's arms.

Similarly, ""Goodnight, My Someone"" is the same tune, in waltz time, as the march-tempo ""Seventy-six Trombones."" Willson's counterpoint, along with two counterpoint song pairs from  Irving Berlin  musicals, are lampooned in the 1959 musical  Little Mary Sunshine . It combines  three  counterpoint songs: ""Playing Croquet,"" ""Swinging,"" and ""How Do You Do?""   The first recording of "" Till There Was You "" to be released came before the original cast album version. Promotional copies of the 45 rpm single, Capitol P3847, were released on November 26th, 1957, even before the Broadway production had premiered. Produced by  Nelson Riddle , it featured his orchestra and 17-year-old vocalist  Sue Raney .

The ""river"" in River City is probably the  Mississippi , near  Davenport, Iowa : the Rock Island conductor's announcing ""River City, Ioway! Cigarettes illegal in this state"" implies crossing the Mississippi from  Rock Island, Illinois , into Iowa at Davenport.   The character of Mayor Shinn indicates that the year is 1912, but the song ""Trouble"" contains references to both  Captain Billy's Whiz-Bang , a monthly humor magazine that didn't begin publication until October 1919, and the nonalcoholic "" near-beer ""  Bevo , which was first produced in 1916.

The Music Man  is a marvelous show, rooted in wholesome and comic tradition."" [ 7 ]  Though  West Side Story  had opened nearly three months earlier,  The Music Man  managed to capture audiences, critics, and five Tony Awards, including Best Musical.       [ edit ]   In popular culture   The Music Man' s popularity has led to its being mentioned, quoted, parodied or pastiched in a number of media, including television, films and popular music.     Television     The Music Man  has been parodied in a number of TV shows, including  The Simpsons  episode "" Marge vs. the Monorail "" written by  Conan O'Brien . At some point during the second Broadway revival, O'Brien was approached about playing the role of Harold Hill for a brief run, but he ultimately could not fit it into his schedule. He says, on the DVD commentary track for the aforementioned  Simpsons  episode, that it was the hardest choice he's ever had to make professionally, because  The Music Man  is one of his favorites. O'Brien did, however, as host of the  58th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards , sing a parody version of ""Trouble"" in his opening monologue targeting NBC and their slide in the ratings.   The television program  Family Guy  has parodied the musical at least twice. In the episode "" Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows "", Lois chastises Brian's high standards in a spoof of Mrs. Paroo and Marian in ""Piano Lesson"". In another episode, ""Patriot Games"", Peter showboats after scoring a touchdown by leading a stadium full of people in a rendition of "" Shipoopi "", complete with choreography from the film. In Episode 22 of  Boston Legal , ""Men to Boys"", Alan Shore sings a parody of the song ""Trouble"" to convince patrons of a restaurant not to eat the trout. In an episode of  The Nanny , Fran goes to her high school reunion, where one of her friends' dates sings ""Seventy-six Trombones"". [ citation needed ]  Several  Music Man  songs were used in  Ally McBeal . [ citation needed ]  In the season 5  Angel  episode, ""Destiny"", Eve says, ""we've got trouble with a capital T, that rhymes with P, that stands for prophecy"".     Film     In the  1960  movie,  The Apartment , the main character, C.C. Baxter, asks Fran Kubelik on a date to the original Broadway production of  The Music Man .   In  The Wedding Singer  Robbie teaches Rosie to sing ""'Til There Was You"" for her 50th wedding anniversary.   In  Romy and Michele's High School Reunion , Michele sings ""The Wells Fargo Wagon"".   In the documentary film ""Get Bruce!"", about comedy writer  Bruce Villanch , Villanch,  Billy Crystal , and composer  Marc Shaiman  offer humorous anecdotes about the issues involved with trying to persuade Meredith Wilson's widow to allow them the right to parody the song ""Trouble"" for one of Crystal's  Academy Award  show opening skits.     Other     The song "" Till There Was You "" was  covered  by  The Beatles  in 1963 on their second album  With the Beatles . It is the only show tune that The Beatles covered, and one of the songs they performed on the  Ed Sullivan Show .   The  alternative rock  band  The Shins  is named after the Shinn family in  The Music Man .  James Russell Mercer  chose the name for the band because his father loved  The Music Man . [ citation needed ]   To evoke turn of the 19th century  Main Street USA  at some of its theme parks around the world,  Walt Disney Parks and Resorts  uses songs from the show, including: "" 76 Trombones "", "" Iowa Stubborn "", ""Wells Fargo Wagon"", and ""Lida Rose"".

The Secret Garden  is a  novel  by  Frances Hodgson Burnett , first published in  1911 . Its working title was  Mistress Mary , in reference to the English nursery rhyme  Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary . It is one of Burnett's most popular novels, and is now considered a classic of children's literature.

Unwanted by them, she has been put into the care of an  Ayah  from birth and told to keep out of sight lest her appearance upsets her mother and father. When an outbreak of  cholera  orphans her, she is sent to Misselthwaite Manor, an isolated country house in  Yorkshire, England . There, she is left mostly to her own devices, by her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a widower still mourning his beautiful young wife, who has died ten years earlier. Hoping to escape his painful memories, he travels constantly, leaving the  manor  in the charge of his  housekeeper , the stern Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald has locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   Mary finds the key and a  robin  shows her the door to the garden behind some ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon Sowerby, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle visits the house briefly for the first time since she arrived, Mary asks him for a bit of earth to make a flower garden, and he agrees. Thanks to the invigorating Yorkshire air and her new-found fascination with the garden, Mary herself begins to blossom, and loses her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   One night Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive and say they cannot hear anything or say that it was the wind. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and is morbidly convinced that Colin will develop the same condition. This fear is shared by Colin who for psychological reasons has never learned to walk. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums. Colin, however, accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often.   As spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous because Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon than indoors with him. One day he voices his resentment and, when Mary resists, he throws a tantrum. To the surprise and amusement of the servants, Mary continues to stand her ground. That evening, Colin has a  hysterical  fit, brought on by his fear of dying young. Mary goes to him and, again taking a firm, no-nonsense stance with him and to calm him down slaps him in the face and to the servants' surprise, when Mary starts screaming at him, he doesn't object. When he asks if he can visit the garden with her, she agrees, as she and Dickon had been planning to suggest it themselves, feeling that it would do Colin good. Colin's doctor, who is Mr. Craven's brother and Colin's uncle, agrees to have Dickon and Mary take Colin outside in a wheelchair. Colin is delighted with the garden, and visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows. As the garden revives and flourishes, so does he. To keep the garden a secret Colin orders everyone to stay away from the path to the Secret Garden.   The first person to discover what the children are doing is the old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, who was a favorite of Colin's mother. Since her death, he has been visiting the locked garden once or twice a year by secretly scaling the wall with a ladder. When he visits the garden for the first time since Mary's arrival (having had to miss several visits because of  rheumatism ), he is angry with the children until he sees how improved both the garden and Colin are. Colin orders him not to tell anybody, and he agrees. Colin resolves that the next time his father returns from abroad he will be able to walk and run like a normal boy. He accomplishes this through a combination of simple physical exercise taught by Dickon and positive thinking. He refuses to think of himself as crippled, and he invents a kind of  mantra  to keep himself in the right, or ""magic,"" frame of mind. He makes great progress, but keeps it hidden from everyone but Mary, Dickon, and Ben, wanting it to be a surprise.   Mr. Craven has been traveling throughout Europe but hurries home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream, imploring him to come to her ""in the garden!"" When he receives a letter from Martha and Dickon's mother (who also knows the secret) saying ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here"", he decides to return home. He arrives while the children are outdoors. He goes out to see Colin for himself, and finds himself drawn to the secret garden, where he is astonished first to hear children's voices and then to find Colin not only racing Mary and Dickon around the garden, but winning. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. Afterwards they walk back to the house, where the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.   Maytham Hall in  Kent, England , where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage to Stephen Townesend, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.  [ 2 ]  Burnett kept an extensive garden, including an impressive rose garden. However, it has been noted that besides the garden, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Major themes   The author, Frances Hodgson Burnett, was a practitioner of  Christian Science  due to the premature death of her son as well as personal illness. [ 4 ]  As a result,  The Secret Garden  espouses the concepts of  New Thought  and  theosophy  as well as ideas about the healing powers of the mind. [ 5 ]   The garden is the book's central symbol. The secret garden at Misselthwaite Manner is the site of both the near destruction and the subsequent regeneration of a family  [ 6 ]  Using the garden motif, Burnett explores the healing power inherent in living things.     [ edit ]   Publication History & Popularity   The Secret Garden first appeared to the public in serial format aimed at adults in 1910, one year prior to its release in book format. Marketing to both adult and juvenile audiences may have had an effect on its early reception; the book was not as celebrated as Burnett's previous works during her lifetime.  [ 7 ]   The Secret Garden paled in comparison to the popularity of Burnett's other works for a long period of time. Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Anne H. Lundin noted [ 8 ]  that the author's obituary notices all remarked on  Little Lord Fauntleroy  and passed over  The Secret Garden  in silence.   With the rise of scholarly work in children's literature over the past quarter century, The Secret Garden has steadily risen to prominence, and is now arguably Burnett's best known work. The book is often noted as one of the best children's books of the twentieth century  [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Dramatic adaptations and sequels   The Secret Garden  has been adapted many times for stage and screen. The first filmed version was made in 1919 by the  Famous Players-Lasky Corporation  with 17 year old  Lila Lee  as Mary and  Paul Willis  as Dickon, but the film is considered lost.   In 1949,  MGM  filmed  the second adaptation  with  Margaret O'Brien . This version was mostly in black-and-white, but the sequences set in the restored garden were filmed in  Technicolor . In 1959,  Dorothea Brooking  adapted the book into a six-part BBC television serial starring  Colin Spaull  as Dickon. Brooking was also responsible for adaptations in 1952 and 1975, both for the BBC. In 1987  Hallmark Hall of Fame  filmed a TV adaptation of the novel starring  Gennie James  as Mary,  Barret Oliver  as Dickon, and  Jadrien Steele  as Colin. A young  Colin Firth  also made a brief appearance as an adult version of Colin Craven.   The most acclaimed film adaptation was  American Zoetrope 's  1993 production . It was directed by  Agnieszka Holland  and starred  Kate Maberly  as Mary,  Heydon Prowse  as Colin,  Andrew Knott  as Dickon and  Dame Maggie Smith  as Mrs. Medlock.   A 2000 sequel entitled  Return to the Secret Garden  was directed by  Scott Featherstone  and won the Director's Gold Award at the 2001 Santa Clarita International Film Festival. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  In 2001, the  TV movie   Back to the Secret Garden , directed by Michael Tuchner, was set in a time when Mary and Colin have married and turned Craven Manor into a shelter for orphans. It starred  Joan Plowright ,  George Baker  and  Camilla Belle  as an American orphan, Lizzie. [ 12 ]   In 1991, a  Japanese animated  version of  The Secret Garden  was made, entitled  Himitsu no Hanazono . [ 13 ]  Another anime movie,  Sk no Strain  (2006), based on another Frances Hodgson Burnett novel,  A Little Princess , draws some elements from  The Secret Garden , mostly the names of Colin, Mary, Martha and Dickon. [ 14 ]   Stage adaptations of the book have been created. One notable adaptation  is a  musical  with music by  Lucy Simon  and book and lyrics by  Marsha Norman , which opened on  Broadway  in 1991. The production was nominated for seven  Tony Awards , winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Daisy Eagan  as Mary, at eleven years old is the youngest person ever to win a Tony).   In 2007 the  Orlando Shakespeare Theater  commissioned April-Dawn Gladu to create an adaptation for their Theater For Young Audiences series. This version's unique qualities include an actress silently playing The Garden Tree, which was the tree that Lilly fell from years ago. As the children work secretly in the garden to bring it to life, the living tree wakes up, flourishes and blooms. [ 15 ]   Oakland Ballet has also done a production of  The Secret Garden  set to music by Sir Edward Elgar.  The Secret Garden  has also been done as an opera, and will be presented by Northwest Children's Opera in June of 2009.   Novels based on the source material have also been produced.  Noel Streatfeild 's novel  The Painted Garden  (U.S. title  Movie Shoes ) has as its central story the filming of  The Secret Garden  in Hollywood.   An unofficial novel about the adult lives of Mary, Colin, and Dickon was written by  Susan Moody  in 1995 and published under two different titles:  Misselthwaite: The Sequel to the Secret Garden  and  Return to the Secret Garden . The  New York Times  also published a brief parodic sequel [ 16 ]  in the same year.

[ 1 ]  It premiered on September 19, 1994 and has been aired on Thursday nights at 10:00 for its entire run. On April 2, 2008, NBC announced that the series will return for its 15th, concluding season. [ 2 ]  Originally scheduled to run for 19 episodes before retiring with a two-hour series finale to be broadcast on March 12, 2009, [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  NBC recently announced it will extend  ER  by an additional three episodes to a full 22 episode order as part of a deal to launch a new series by John Wells. [ 5 ]  ER's final episode is scheduled to air on April 2, 2009 with a one-hour retrospective preceding it. [ 6 ]     History and production   In 1974, author  Michael Crichton  wrote a screenplay based on his own experiences as a medical resident in a busy ER. The screenplay went nowhere, and Crichton focused on other topics. In 1990, he published the novel  Jurassic Park , and in 1993 began a collaboration with director  Steven Spielberg  on the  film adaptation  of that. The Crichton-Spielberg team then returned to  ER  but decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film. Spielberg's  Amblin Entertainment  provided  John Wells  as the show's executive producer.   The script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in  1974 . The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 made the Dr. Lewis character a woman and the Dr. Benton character an African-American, and shortened the running time by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV. [ 7 ]   Due to a lack of time and money to build a set, the pilot episode of  ER  was filmed in the former  Linda Vista Community Hospital  in Los Angeles, an old facility that ceased operating as a medical center in 1990. [ 8 ]  A set modeled after Los Angeles County General Hospital's emergency room was built soon after at the  Warner Bros.  studios in  Burbank, California , although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city's famous  ""L""  train platforms.   ER  premiered on Monday, September 19, 1994 from 9:00-11:00 p.m. (EDT) and moved into the 10:00 p.m Thursday night timeslot three days later, where it remained for all fifteen seasons. Steven Spielberg left the show after one year in a producer's chair, but he made one critical decision with lasting effects: the Carol Hathaway character, who died at the end of the original script for the pilot episode, was retained.   ER  was filmed in 1.78:1  widescreen  from the start, even though it was not broadcast in widescreen until the seventh season when it began appearing in the  1080i  HD format where NBC was being broadcast digitally. [ citation needed ]  Since the sixth episode of Season 7, it has appeared in  letterbox  format when in standard definition. As a result, every US DVD box set shows the widescreen versions of the episodes, including those episodes originally broadcast in 1.33:1 (full screen) format. The episodes also appear in 1080i widescreen when rerun on  TNT HD , though the first six seasons still show in fullscreen on the digital  TNT  network. Only the live episode ""Ambush"" at the beginning of the fourth season, and the opening credits for the first six seasons, are in standard 4:3 aspect ratio.     Episodes       Main article:  List of ER episodes       ER  has had many memorable episodes, and is particularly notable for broadcasting a live episode, ""Ambush,"" in 1997, with the NBC camera crew disguised as a  PBS  crew making a documentary film in the hospital. The actors performed the show again three hours later so that the  West Coast  airing would be live as well. This episode received  Emmy Award  nominations for Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic), and won the Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Series.   Most episodes center on the ER, with almost all scenes at the hospital. There is, however, often at least one scene showing the goings-on of the ER staff outside the hospital. Also, there is a tradition to feature storylines each season completely outside of the ER. One early such instance involved a road trip near Las Vegas, Nevada (Drs. Ross and Greene). Season Eight included a storyline in Hawaii (Drs. Greene and Corday). More recently, the series has included storylines in Democratic Republic of Congo (Drs. Kovac and Carter) and Darfur, Sudan (Drs. Pratt and Carter, with Noah Wyle appearing as a guest star in the season following his departure from the show).     Cast     Main cast          Original cast of the show (1994-1995)       The original cast consisted of  Anthony Edwards  as Dr. Mark Greene,  George Clooney  as Dr. Doug Ross,  Sherry Stringfield  as Dr. Susan Lewis,  Noah Wyle  as John Carter, and  Eriq La Salle  as Dr. Peter Benton.  Julianna Margulies  guest starred in the pilot as Carol Hathaway before becoming part of the regular cast.   The first addition to the cast came towards the end of Season One with Jeanie Boulet ( Gloria Reuben ) joining the supporting cast and later becoming part of the main cast in Season Two.  Laura Innes  signed on to the supporting cast in Season Two as Kerry Weaver before becoming part of the main cast in Season Three. Anna Del Amico ( Maria Bello ) was introduced at the end of Season Three and then joined the main cast at the beginning of Season Four where Elizabeth Corday ( Alex Kingston ) is also introduced. Season Five began with the addition of  Kellie Martin  as Medical student Lucy Knight and Season Six opened with the addition of then-unknown Croatian actor  Goran Visnjic  to the cast as the tragic Dr. Luka Kovac and soon after,  Maura Tierney  as Abby Lockhart, who together formed the series longest running, and most complicated, romantic relationship. That season also saw the addition of  Paul McCrane  as Dr. Robert ""Rocket"" Romano to the main cast after being part of the supporting cast in both Seasons Four and Five.  Michael Michele  as Dr. Cleo Finch and  Erik Palladino  as Dr. Dave Malucci also joined the cast that season and finally,  Ming-Na  returned to reprise a character she had created as a supporting actress in Season One, Jing-Mei ""Deb"" Chen. Season Eight saw the addition of  Sharif Atkins  as Michael Gallant.  Mekhi Phifer  originated the character of Dr. Greg Pratt in Season Eight and joined the main cast in Season Nine. Season Ten saw the addition of  Parminder Nagra  as Dr. Neela Rasgotra and  Linda Cardellini  as Nurse Samantha Taggart.  Scott Grimes  joined the supporting cast in Season Ten as Dr. Archie Morris and became part of the main cast in Season Twelve;  Shane West  joined the cast in Season Eleven as Dr. Ray Barnett. Season Thirteen saw the addition of  John Stamos  as Dr. Tony Gates, reprising a role he originated in Season Twelve as an Emergency Medical Technician. Season Fourteen saw the introduction of supporting actor  David Lyons  as Dr. Simon Brenner; Lyons would join the main cast in Season Fifteen, along with  Angela Bassett  as Dr. Cate Banfield.

Wyle was previously billed as a guest star for a four-episode appearance in Season 12. [ 9 ]   Note 2 :  Although Edwards was billed with the regular cast in Episode 316, his was a single-episode reprise of role he left at the end of Season 8. [ 10 ]     Departures from the main cast   Sherry Stringfield 's first departure on the show was in 1996, when her character,  Susan Lewis , moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in the Season 3 episode ""Union Station."" In 2001, Stringfield returned to the series, reprising her role of Dr. Lewis, in the Season 8 episode ""Never Say Never."" She departed again in the Season 12 premiere, ""Canon City."" This second departure was not depicted, but rather mentioned by character  Kerry Weaver  four episodes later in ""Wake Up,"" when she explains that Susan had accepted a tenure-track position at a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa, after having been denied tenure at County.   After playing  Anna Del Amico  for one season,  Maria Bello  was not a part of the ensemble cast when Season 5 began. Like  Susan Lewis 's second exit, her character's departure was mentioned but not depicted; in the season premiere, ""Day for Knight,""  Carter  explains to new medical student  Lucy Knight  that the locker she is inheriting used to belong to Anna Del Amico, who is working in a pediatric ER back in Philadelphia, where she has family and a boyfriend.   George Clooney  left the show in 1999, in the Season 5 episode ""The Storm, Part 2,"" when his character,  Doug Ross , quit before being fired by County for his involvement in a patient's death. Clooney returned in the season 6 episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow"" in a cameo when his character reunited with  Carol Hathaway .   Gloria Reuben  departed early in Season 6, in the episode ""The Peace of Wild Things,"" when her character,  Jeanie Boulet , decided to become a stay-at-home mom and care for her newly adopted HIV-positive baby. Reuben returned in the season 14 episode ""Status Quo"" with her HIV positive child.          Cast of the fifteenth and final season (2008-2009)       Kellie Martin , who played medical student  Lucy Knight , left the series midway through Season 6 in the episode ""All In The Family,"" when her character was killed by a patient suffering from undiagnosed  schizophrenia ; his  psychotic break  occurred before a backed-up psychiatry department could arrive in the ER for a consult.   Julianna Margulies  left the show at the end of Season 6, in the episode ""Such Sweet Sorrow,"" when her character,  Carol Hathaway , decided on the spur of the moment to go to Seattle, Washington, and reunite with  Doug Ross , her true love and the father of her twin daughters.   Erik Palladino  departed early in Season 8, in the episode (""Never Say Never"") after his character,  Dave Malucci , was fired for inappropriate conduct.   Eriq La Salle 's character,  Peter Benton , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". He took a job with a set schedule at another hospital in order to spend more time with his son, Reese, and his girlfriend, former fellow ER doctor  Cleo Finch . La Salle returned in the season 8 episodes ""It's All in Your Head"" in a cameo to speak with Elizabeth Corday and ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Michael Michele 's character,  Cleo Finch , departed in the Season 8 episode ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" with her boyfriend, and fellow doctor,  Peter Benton , after having previously taken a job at the same hospital with set schedules (in fact it was she who arranged the interview which resulted in Benton's job offer). Michele returned in the season 8 episode ""On the Beach"" in a cameo to attend Mark Greene's funeral.   Anthony Edwards 's character,  Mark Greene , died of a brain tumor in Season 8's penultimate episode, ""On the Beach."" Unusually, Anthony Edwards was credited in the following episode ""Lockdown"". Edwards returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" where he appeared in multiple flashback scenes to give insight into the past of Angela Bassett's character. [ 11 ]   Paul McCrane 's character,  Robert Romano , whose arm had been severed just above the elbow by a helicopter's tail rotor in the Season 9 premiere ""Chaos Theory,"" was killed in the Season 10 episode ""Freefall"" when a helicopter that was taking off from the hospital roof was buffeted by strong winds, causing it to crash on the roof and plummet over the side of the building; it fell into a crowded ambulance bay and landed squarely on Romano. McCrane returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Sharif Atkins  left the series in the Season 10 episode ""Where There's Smoke,"" when his character,  Michael Gallant , revealed that the Army was sending him to Iraq. Atkins returned in the Season 11 episodes ""Here and There"" and ""Back in the World"" in several scenes taking place in Iraq and then again in the season 12 episodes ""Two Ships,"" ""I Do,"" ""Split Decisions,"" and ""The Gallant Hero and The Tragic Victor"" where he married Neela and then returned to Iraq where he was killed by an  improvised explosive device  while serving a second tour there.   Alex Kingston 's character,  Elizabeth Corday , left the series in the Season 11 episode ""Fear"" after getting in trouble for performing an illegal organ donation procedure; rather than being summarily fired, County offered her a demotion to a non-tenured position, but she turned it down and opted to return to England instead. In an interview with Britain's  Radio Times  magazine, Kingston spoke of being written off the show due to her age, a statement that sparked some controversy. She later withdrew that claim. [ 12 ]  Kingston returned in the 15th season episode ""Dream Runner"" in two of Neela's dream sequences. [ 13 ]   Ming-Na  left in Season 11 as an attending physician when her character,  Jing-Mei Chen , resigned in in order to take care of her ailing father, whom she later  euthanized  in the episode ""Twas the Night."" This was the second time her character left County General; in season 1, medical student ""Deb"" Chen recurred in an eight episode story arc which concluded with her leaving medical school after accidentally leaving a guide wire in a patient's chest and deciding she was better suited to do research than to do applied medicine.   Noah Wyle  left in the Season 11 finale, ""The Show Must Go On."" His character,  John Carter , after having received tenure at County, decided to reunite with his girlfriend  Kem Likasu  (portrayed by  Thandie Newton ). Wyle returned in the season 12 episodes ""Quintessence of Dust,"" ""Darfur,"" ""No Place to Hide,"" and ""There Are No Angels Here"" where he is practicing medicine in Darfur and then again in the 15th season episodes ""The Beginning of the End"" and ""T-Minus-6,"" two of five episodes he'll return for.   Laura Innes  left midway through Season 13, in the episode ""A House Divided,"" when a reluctant  Luka Kova  was forced by budget cuts to fire her character,  Kerry Weaver . After bracing for a battle to keep her position, and in spite of the fact that Kova realized he must find a way to keep her on staff, Weaver ultimately decided to resign from County and accept a job offer from a television station in Miami, Florida. Innes returned in the 15th season episode ""Heal Thyself"" in a cameo during flashbacks.   Shane West  left at the end of the 13th season after his character,  Ray Barnett  lost both his legs and returned to Baton Rouge with his mother to recuperate. West's final appearance as a main cast member was in ""The Honeymoon is Over."" West returned in the 15th season episode ""Haunted"" to visit Neela and the rest of the staff.   Mekhi Phifer  departed during the first episode of Season 15. His character,  Gregory Pratt , died in the ER as the result of blast injuries suffered in an ambulance explosion in the final episode of Season 14.   Goran Visnjic  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with his TV wife Abby Lockhart. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  Luka had previously left the show in the season finale of season 13 when he left for Croatia to care for his ailing father. He returned for seven episodes in season 14 to wrap up his medical storyline and then made a brief appearance in ""Book of Abby"" where he, Abby, and their son Joe embark on their new life together.   Maura Tierney  departed in the third episode of season 15 in an episode entitled ""Book of Abby"" with her TV husband Luka Kovac. Along with their son Joe, they presumably headed to Boston, where Abby got a new job.  [ 3 ]  She attempted to leave the ER quietly, however the rest of the staff made it known how much they will miss her. Nurse Haleh Adams showed Abby a hidden wall with the locker labels of all the past staff members since season one, with the exception of Carter who refused to deface government property (the other names on the wall were mostly departed former characters as well as some prominent writers and producers). Abby then left the ER and met Luka and her son Joe outside where they embark on their new life together.
