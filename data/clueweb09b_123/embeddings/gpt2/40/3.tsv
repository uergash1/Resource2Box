Nelson                                                                                             Bryan Smith (42) leads Chris Carr (4), Joe Kopp and Ken Coolbeth at the Lucas Oils Indy Mile dirt-track event. Carr went on to win the race while Coolbeth wrapped up his third consecutive AMA Grand National Twins Championship. As you've no doubt read by now, the inaugural Red Bull Indianapolis Grand Prix was a success despite crazy weather that cut the MotoGP race short and forced the 250 race to be cancelled. There were plenty of highlights over the weekend: Walking into Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the first time and realizing how enormous it really is. Seeing Nicky Hayden lead the race and score his first podium of the year. And watching Valentino Rossi win and take the record for most premier-class victories from Giacomo Agostini. But the best part of the weekend for me was going to the Lucas Oil Indy Mile at the Indiana State Fairgrounds. That's right, a dirt-track race. When I was growing up, the AMA's Grand National Championship had roadracing and dirt-track interwoven, with points from five venues-roadrace, short track, half-mile, mile and TT-counting toward a single championship. So it was natural to keep an eye on the dirt-track results to see how guys like Kenny Roberts and Gary Nixon were faring. Ironically, many racers that started out on the dirt were eventually forced onto the pavement to score as many points as possible, and-as is well documented-this is how quite a few roadracing champions got their start. Anyway, I ended up following dirt-track as much as roadracing when I was younger, and have always wanted to go to a mile race. The Indy Mile in particular has some interesting history for roadracing fans. It's where Kenny Roberts won aboard the infamous Yamaha TZ750-based dirt-tracker, after which the bike was essentially banned from the series. I've been to a few dirt-track races and done plenty of ice racing on ovals, but nothing prepared me for the Indianapolis race. Kent and I had media passes for the night, and were standing ready on the inside guardrail to watch the first heat race. I could have reached out and touched the bikes as they went by and even got a big faceful of dirt on the first lap. It was incredible to watch the riders fling their bikes sideways with the throttle wide open at way more than 100 miles per hour, then use the throttle to scrub off speed. It's no wonder dirt-trackers go so well on pavement when they have mastered that kind of control. Despite the divergence of the two series over the past years, it was great to see some roadracers in the field. In fact, Chris Carr, a former factory Harley-Davidson VR1000 rider and current holder of the motorcycle land speed record, won the main event on a Harley. Henry Wiles, a frontrunner in the Moto-ST series, finished seventh on an Aprilia. And Nick Cummings, one of my teammates for last year's Daytona 8-hour Moto-ST race, finished ninth. The race itself was a barnburner, with multi-rider packs through the field and a good battle for the lead. Red flags close to the end of the race left a five-lap dash to the finish, with Carr and Kenny Coolbeth dicing for the lead right to the finish. With the mile race the same weekend as the Grand Prix, there were plenty of spectators at the fairgrounds and I saw a lot of team shirts from the Brickyard. It was interesting to see the Europeans out of their somewhat isolated paddock and watching a uniquely American event. At night, in a fairgrounds with the smell of horses in the air and spectators sitting on tailgates in the infield, is the way dirt-track should be, and I imagine the experience for them was similar to an American going to a Grand Prix in Europe for the first time. The huge number of spectators did turn out to be a problem for the fairgrounds, as the small staff appeared completely overwhelmed. I heard from people that waited in line for more than an hour to pick up tickets, and others that saw the line and simply turned around. I'm sure the staff will be much better prepared next year, and the turnout this year was hopefully a boost for the flat track community. Estimates put attendance at close to 20,000 spectators, and in a news release Chris Carr said that the race did more for the sport of flat track than just about anything since ""On Any Sunday."" If you attend the Grand Prix next year, it's definitely worth checking out the dirt-track race as well. But there's no need to wait for Indy; there are a handful of Miles on the AMA's dirt-track schedule, and at least one of them should be on your must-see list of motorcycle events.

The race marked the start of the second half of the race to qualify for the  Chase for the Nextel Cup  and the first telecast for  TNT  of six in the new NASCAR television package for 2007.  Kyle Petty  made his broadcasting debut on this day, replacing  Benny Parsons  who died from cancer during Speedweeks. Throughout the week, drivers in the Truck, Busch, and Cup series along with the Grand National division wore small black logos reading ""WCF (William Clifton France) Innovator, Pioneer, Friend 1933-2007"" to pay tribute to former NASCAR president Bill France Jr.     [ edit ]   Qualifying   With another impressive lap,  Ryan Newman  lived up to his namesake, ""Rocketman"" by recording his third consecutive pole. Defending race winner  Denny Hamlin  aspired to become the first driver since  Tim Richmond  to record 3 consecutive Pocono victories.  Martin Truex Jr. , fresh off his first NEXTEL Cup win, lined up in third. Failing to make the race were  Michael Waltrip ,  Kenny Wallace ,  Kevin Lepage ,  Jeremy Mayfield ,  Dale Jarrett , and  Mike Bliss .     [ edit ]   Race   The start of the race was halted by a nearly two hour rain delay as the estimated green flag was set to wave at 2:20 PM. When the race finally started, it was the same routine as last year; Hamlin leading the first lap. Although it was widely expected that Hamlin would again walk away with a victory, a caution flag set up a pit cycle. While Hamlin's crew opted for four tires, everyone else took two, and Hamlin would spend the rest of the day fighting through the field. Jeff Gordon's crew chief,  Steve Letarte , called his driver in earlier than the rest of the field. With another rain shower approaching Pocono, he took the chance that all the other cars would have to pit after they did, thereby giving them the lead. Letarte's intuition proved correct as the race was called at lap 106 and Jeff Gordon ended up with his third Pocono 500 win. The actual race distance was 265 miles.   Top ten results:       Pos.

Pocono's unique 2.5-mile track features three turns, each with its own degree of banking (Turn 1 - 675 ft., 14 degrees, Turn 2 - 750 ft., 8 degrees, Turn 3 - 800 ft., 6 degrees) and three straights (Main Straight - 3,740 ft., Long Pond Straight-3,055 ft. and the North Straight - 1,780 ft.). This combination produces fender-to-fender action in the turns and 200 mph slingshots on the long straights with photo finishes. The combination of the track's own challenges and the fact that the three turns each have their own characteristics, has resulted in a unique description: ""the superspeedway that drives like a road course"". NASCAR Sprint Cup racing at Pocono is what great stock car racing is all about. Its great racing and location, in the heart of the Pocono Mountain resort area has made Pocono Raceway a favorite destination of race fans and vacationers.   General track information can be found here:  http://www.poconoraceway.com/ Track Map Click here to see the course map:  http://www.poconoraceway.com/maps_facilitymap.asp   Hotel Information Lodging and Dining options can be found here:  http://www.poconoraceway.com/areainfo.asp   Directions Click here for directions:  http://www.poconoraceway.com/maps_directions.asp Forms Download the Student Evaluation Form Download the Instructor Evaluation Form  Download the Pocono Tech Form  Download the Classroom Overview Document                       Schedule Download our full 2009 Season Schedule.

clueweb09-en0010-27-27522	Moves to third in series championship point standings  06/09/2008 Speed charges hard in final laps at Pocono Pocono, Pa. (June 7, 2008) Scott Speed and the Red Bull team always bring their A game to the track and this weekend was no different. Speed and his Eddie Sharp Racing crew earned nearly every accolade at Pocono Speedway. Speed sat at the top of the practice speed chart, earned the SIM Factory Pole Award by blowing the competition away with a 53.862 second qualifying lap, the Aarons Lap Leader of the Race for leading the most laps and charged from 25th to a second place finish in the final laps of the Pocono 200. Oh, yes, and in between all of that, Speed jetted to Texas Motor Speedway and back to run in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck race.  Just another weekend in the life of one of stock car racings rising stars.    Speed started the day from the pole position at Pocono Speedway and quickly pulled out to a dominating lead. During the first caution on lap three, Speed reports to the team that the No. 2 Red Bull Toyota is  just a little bit free. Its not that bad and Im not complaining; its just a handful right now.  The next caution emerged on lap nine and Speed radioed that the car is  no so much loose, just a lack of overall grip on all four corners.     Speed led the first 12 laps before the No. 16 of Justin Allgaier caught the Red Bull Toyota and took over the lead position. Speed settled into second place and  focused on adjusting his line to catch the No. 16 that was pulling away. On lap 29, Speed and the race leaders came to pit road under the caution for scheduled stops. The Red Bull crew put four fresh tires on the Camry and made adjustments to give the driver the  grip he was looking for. Upon examination, the right rear tire had a gash in it and had already lost many pounds of air. The caution and pit stop could not have happened at a better time.    Speed restarted the race and gained the lead in the first lap. The caution came out again immediately on lap 33. During the seven caution laps, Speed and Crew Chief Patrick Donahue exchanged comical quips. Donahue reminded Speed to conserve his fuel, to which Speed replied,  No problem! Im a saving fuel kinda guy!  As Speed cruised down the frontstretch on the next lap,  Donahue radioed,  Hey Scott! See my umbrella?  Speed laughed and replied,  Awwww, isnt that nice?! You and the missus up there.   The race restarted on lap 40 with Speed out front. On lap 48, the drama began for the No. 2 team. Speed radioed that he felt something suddenly break in the front of the car. Spotter Slugger Labbe confirmed that the left front tire was flat. Speed was able to  immediately steer the car to pit road under the green flag. The Red Bull crew quickly put on four tires and added fuel to the Toyota and Speed rejoined the field.    Speed radioed, I dont know what happened. I didnt touch the curb at all. Donahue reassured his driver, it wasnt you, Scott. While in the pit, the caution flag was thrown for an incident on the track, aiding Speed and the Red Bull team in remaining on the lead lap despite the green flag stop. During the caution, the leaders chose to also pit and as the field cycled through, Speed was returned to the lead position.    During the caution laps, the team radioed Speed that the No. 16 had lost third gear and may have issues on the restart.  Thats a shame,  replied Speed.  That was some really good racing we had going on there with  the 16. Thats just really unfortunate.  With 24 laps remaining in the race, Speed restarted in the first position and pulled out once again to a strong lead.    On lap 65 the left front tire blew again. Speed calmly maneuvered the No. 2 Red Bull Toyota back to his pit for another set of tires. Once again, the team returned Speed to the track on the lead lap. When Speed rejoined the field he was buried deep in the field in position 25.    Only two laps later, the caution came out and Speed was scored in the 18th position. As Donahue  and Labbe tried to reassure Speed that he could pick up a position here and there, Speed replied,   lets not predict where were going to finish. Clearly we cant predict anything; weve already blown two tires while leading. Im just going to go out and pass as many cars as I can and see what happens.    And that is precisely what Scott Speed did. On the restart, Speed powered into the top-10. When the caution flag flew on lap 77 that sent the  race to a green-white-checkered finish, Speed was already up to the fifth position. Excellent job! radioed Donahue. That was a really good restart there.    The race resumed on lap 85. Speed took the white flag on lap 86 in the fourth position and set to charge for the lead, going three-wide into Turn 1 against teammate Justin Lofton in the No. 20 Lofton Cattle Dodge and the 00 of Rob Brent. There was contact and cars scrambled to avoid the melee. The race remained green and the No. 2 Red Bull Toyota crossed the start-finish line on the bumper of race winner, Ricky Stenhouse, Jr.  Check out new race gallery About Module New:Biography Not in Category Biography Module New:Racing-History Not in Category 1993 1995 1996-2001 2001 2002 2004 2002 2003 2004 2005 2005 2006 2007 Module New:Interests Not in Category Race-related favorites Other favorites Module New:Scottspeed.org Not in Category ScottSpeed.org Latest Module New:News Not in Category Speed Finishes Fourth at MIS; Climbs to 2nd in Series Point Standings 3rd place at Michigan Int'l Speedway in the Craftsman Series Another Top-10 for Speed; Leaves Iowa Top-10 in Points 8th at Springfield Fairgrounds Kansas Lottery $150 Grand Red Bull Driver Scott Speed to Race NCTS Limited Schedule Speed Leads Most Laps; Takes 2nd at Kentucky Speed charges hard in final laps at Pocono 1st at Nashville Superspeedway 2nd at Pocono 1st at Kentucky 1st at Berlin Raceway Speed Tackles Salem with Veteran-like Consistency; Starts and Finishes in 5th Position Red Bull Driver Scott Speed claims frist truck victory!

Pocono Raceway  (formerly  Pocono International Raceway ) is located in the Pocono Mountains  at Long Pond. It hosts two annual NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races held in June and August. Pocono is used throughout the year by sports car and motorcycle clubs as well as racing schools. The triangular oval also has three separate infield sections of racetrack - North Course, East Course and South Course.              It has three varying kinds of turns for drivers to tackle, with corners banked anywhere from 6 to 14 degrees. Since the course is neither an oval nor a road course, drivers generally refer to it as a 'roval'.

Pocono Raceway has a massive front straight  that often sees cars going four, five and six wide before they funnel down into turn one.   The triangle-shaped track has three different corner lengths and bankings making it very  difficult to set up a car and to drive well. Pocono is, in a word, unique.   But for as difficult as it is to set up and drive Pocono frequently hosts some great racing with races often decided within the last couple of laps.

The  2008  Pocono 500  was the fourteenth race of the  2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup schedule  and was run on Sunday,  June 8th  at  Pocono Raceway  in  Long Pond, Pennsylvania . The race was the first NASCAR telecast on  TNT  for the 2008 season starting at 12:30 PM  US EDT  and on radio via  MRN  and  Sirius Satellite Radio  at 1:15 PM US EDT.           Contents       1   Pre-race news   2   Qualifying   3   Happy Hour   4   Race     4.1   Information   4.2   Incidents                   [ edit ]   Pre-race news     Terry Labonte  will begin to fill in for  Kyle Petty  in the #45  Petty Enterprises   Dodge  for five races as Petty moves upstairs to the broadcast booth.   Dario Franchitti  returns to the #40  Chip Ganassi Racing  Dodge following his injury several weeks ago.   Jamie McMurray  discredits rumors about leaving and says that he will return to the #26  Roush Fenway Racing   Ford  next year   Verizon Wireless  is planning to buy out  Alltel  in a $28 billion ( US ) transaction and lose the  Alltel  name, putting  Ryan Newman  in jeopardy as  Sprint Nextel  and NASCAR are trying to phase out all other mobile telecommunications corporations from the sport, much akin to what occurred with  Richard Childress Racing  and  AT&T   the previous season .       [ edit ]   Qualifying   Jimmie Johnson  started out on the pole position, but almost an hour later,  Kasey Kahne  bumped him.  Dale Earnhardt, Inc.  teammates  Mark Martin  and  Regan Smith  made up the second row, while  Joe Nemechek  and  Carl Edwards  made up their third row.   Failed to Qualify:   J.J. Yeley  (#96).  NOTE:   Tony Raines  (#34) withdrew before qualifying.     [ edit ]   Happy Hour   It was anything but happy for points leader  Kyle Busch , attempting to race all three series in three days in three sites. His primary car crashed and will be forced to a back-up car and start from the rear as a result. Also going to the back of the field was  Sam Hornish Jr.  for the same reason.  Carl Edwards  ran the fatest lap of the session at 164.769mph. Eventual race winner  Kasey Kahne  ran the second lap of the session, which was 0.6 seconds slower than Edwards lap.     [ edit ]   Race   The woes of the #18 team continued into the race, when Kyle Busch crashed into the wall early into the race, and had to replace the nose, finishing dead last in the 43-car field, changing a 142 point lead to a 21 point lead to  Jeff Burton .  Greg Biffle  suffered a pit road speeding penalty late in the race under green, causing him to lose the race.  Carl Edwards  looked to be a favorite to win the race in the closing laps, but a flat tire under a caution with about 20 laps to go destroyed his chances, as there were 33 cars on the lead lap. As the green flag came out, polesitter Kasey Kahne took the lead with 15 laps remaining from  Brian Vickers  in the  Team Red Bull  #83  Toyota  and won his second points race of the season within the last three weeks.

[ edit ]   Incidents     On lap 41,  Kurt Busch  loses control of his car exiting turn 1, he slides into the grass and briefly becomes airborne de to the bumpiness of the infield. He would later recover with no significant damage and rally to an 8th place finish.   Points leader  Kyle Busch  hits the frontstretch wall after unsuccessfully trying to change lanes on lap 48, causing  Jamie McMurray  to make contact with the left rear corner of his car. The incident causes significant body damage on the entire right side of his car.   Patrick Carpentier  and  Sam Hornish Jr.  make contact in turn 1 on lap 58, also collecting  David Gilliland   On lap 82,  Clint Bowyer  loses control of his car exiting turn 3.  Juan Pablo Montoya  has nowhere to go, and ends up hitting Bowyer behind the driver's door on the left side of the car. Bowyer spins and eventually finds the pit road wall where his car comes to a stop. Montoya's car is on fire and he limps to the end of pit road where he exits the car. Bowyer later returns to finish the race 45 laps down, and Montoya parks his car after 157 laps.   Michael Waltrip  hits the turn 1 outside retaining wall on lap 106   Dario Franchitti  spins in turn 3 on lap 123   Already nursing a damaged race car,  Kyle Busch  hits the curb in the famed tunnel turn causing him to spin during the cycle of the last green flag pit stops on lap 178. This spin will seal his 43rd place finish in the event.

I'm a student at university and only come home during the holidays, is it possible to take my driving test quickly?                                                                    What will I need to bring to my first driving lesson?              You will need to bring both parts of your provisional driving licence with you to your first lesson. You are also required to read a car number plate from a distance of 20.5 metres so please bring with you glasses if you believe you would not be able to do this without them.          I've never driven before and I'm extremely nervous what will I do on my first lesson?           We understand that you will be nervous at driving for the first time and to help you with this we will take you to a quiet location, explain the controls of the car and allow you to get used to the vehicle before driving on major roads. Only when you feel ready to advance to the major roads will we do so.          How long will my driving lesson last?          The length of your lesson depends on the time you have available. At Ignition Driving School we are flexible as to the length of the lesson and the time of day it takes place. We believe that the optimum concentration period is 2 hours therefore we recommend having either a one or two hour lesson at least once a week.          What car will I be taking my lessons in?          Ignition Driving School currently uses a various cars. If you have a  preference as to which car you would like to learn in then please ask when making your booking, and we will do our best to meet your requirements.          Will I have to drive with someone sitting in the back of the car?          It is our policy to give one-to-one tuition and we do not allow passengers to sit in the back of the car whilst teaching. However, occasionally in order to ensure that our teaching is of the highest standard, we may have an external examiner from the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) observing our lessons. When a check test is necessary we will ask for volunteers to assist and we respect your decision not to partake. .          How long will it take me to reach test standard?          The DSA advises students take a minimum of 45 hours worth of professional tuition combined with at least 22 hours of private practice. We understand that this is different for each student and will depend on the frequency of lessons and ability to learn. We will endeavour to get you up to test standard in the shortest time possible.          What happens if I pass my theory test but fail my hazard perception test?          The minimum pass mark for the multiple choice theory test is 30 out of 35 and for the hazard perception test you must obtain a pass mark of 44 out of 75. You must pass both the theory test and the hazard perception test at the same time in order to get your theory test pass certificate. Should you fail either of these tests then you must re-sit both tests again.          How long does the practical driving test last?          The practical driving test lasts approximately 35-40 minutes and will entail driving on different types of roads with various road conditions. In addition to this you will be asked to perform 2 reversing manoeuvres and potentially an emergency stop exercise. Your Ignition Driving School instructor will ensure that you are well prepared for all aspects of the practical driving test giving you the best chance possible of passing.          Which car will I take my practical driving test in?          You are able to take the practical test in your own car. To do this your car must be in a road worthy condition, have L-plates visible from the front and back of the car and a further interior mirror for the examiner's use. However, most students prefer to take the practical driving test in their instructor's car as this is the car that they will be most used to.          I'm a student at university and only come home during the holidays, is it possible to take my driving test quickly?          Our Intensive courses provide the ideal solution to students wishing to get up to test standard in a limited space of time. If you have a specific time frame in mind then please inform us in plenty of time to allow us to schedule the lessons effectively.

It is the site of two annual  NASCAR   Sprint Cup Series  races held just weeks apart in June and August.   Pocono is one of a very few NASCAR tracks not owned by either  Speedway Motorsports, Inc.  or  International Speedway Corporation , the dominant track owners in NASCAR. It is owned by the Mattioli family, which also owns  South Boston Speedway  in  South Boston ,  Virginia .   Outside of the NASCAR races, Pocono is used throughout the year by sports car and motorcycle clubs as well as racing schools. The triangular oval also has three separate infield sections of racetrack - North Course, East Course and South Course. Each of these infield sections use a separate portion of the tri-oval to complete the track. During regular non-race weekends, multiple clubs can use the track by running on different infield sections. Also some of the infield sections can be run in either direction, or multiple infield sections can be put together - such as running the North Course and the South Course and using the tri-oval to connect the two.

From 1971 to 1989, the  United States Auto Club  and the  CART  IndyCar World Series (later the  Champ Car World Series  before its 2008 merger into the  Indy Racing League ) held a 500-mile race at Pocono. In 1989,  Emerson Fittipaldi  set a qualifying track record of 211.715 mph. However, after the 1989 race, the track was criticized for its roughness and lack of safety features, and was removed from the CART schedule.     [ edit ]   Race of Champions   From  1977  to  1991 , Pocono Raceway hosted the  Race of Champions  Modified race. From 1977 to 1979, the race was held on the 2.5 mile triangular superspeedway; from 1980 onward, the three-quarter-mile infield oval was used.  Richie Evans  and George Kent were the leading winners, each winning two of the fifteen RoC events at Pocono. In  1992 , the Race of Champions was moved to  Flemington Raceway .          Victory Lane at Pocono during pre-race ceremonies at the 2005  Pocono 500         [ edit ]   Track configuration   Pocono Raceway has a unique design. Each turn is modeled after turns at 3 different tracks. Turn One (14 degree banking) was modeled after the now defunct  Trenton Speedway , Turn Two (also known as ""The Tunnel Turn"") is like  Indianapolis Motor Speedway  (9 degree banking), and Turn 3 (6 degree banking) is similar to  The Milwaukee Mile . It could be said to be a  tri-oval , but the turns are much more severe than those of a more typical tri-oval such as  Daytona  and the track is really nearly a  triangle . They have been likened somewhat to the hairpin-style turns of road courses. An additional complication is that the three turns are not identical, nor are any of the three straights identical in length. The long frontstretch often requires a gear change due to the high  RPMs  attained. The banking of each turn is considerably less than on many other long ovals. Although the track is long (2.5 miles), the sharp nature of the turns and low banking tends to make the overall speeds much lower than at other tracks of similar lengths, thus  restrictor plates  are not needed here. For its unique characteristics, Pocono is sometimes referred to as a  roval . Others refer to Pocono as a modified road course due to the use of shifting gears to handle the range between the slowest curve and the fastest straightaway.   The odd design makes the setup of the car and the crew's ability to make chassis adjustments even more crucial here than at many other tracks. Often it is the difference between a winning performance and a poor performance. Drivers tend to either love the track or hate it, largely depending on how well it suits their driving style and their crew's abilities.     [ edit ]   Notable Events     August 4 ,  1974 :  Richard Petty  wins the inaugural Pocono 500.       August 1 ,  1976 : Petty scores a popular win after  David Pearson  blows a tire with two laps to go.       1985  Bill Elliott sweeps both Pocono cup races.       1986 - 1987 :  Tim Richmond  wins three Pocono Races in a row. The third and last was the spring race in 1987. Richmond had just returned after missing the first part of the season batteling HIV. Richmond was the first HIV positive race car driver to win a major race, this wasn't revealed for nearly four years.       July 20 ,  1986 :  Tim Richmond  recovers from a crash and beats  Ricky Rudd  and  Geoff Bodine  in a photo finish.       June 19 ,  1988 : On the opening lap of the 1988 Miller High-life 500,  Bobby Allison  suffered career-ending injuries when he spun and was T-boned by the #63 of  Jocko Maggiacomo .       1999 :  Bobby Labonte  sweeps both races at Pocono.       June 18 ,  2000 :  Jeremy Mayfield  knocked the late  Dale Earnhardt  out of his way to score his third career Winston Cup win.       July 28 ,  2002 :  Steve Park  and  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  became entangled exiting turn one, and both cars slammed into the inside wall, causing Park's vehicle to go airborne over the hood of Earnhardt's car and barrel roll. The incident resulted in a lengthy  red flag  to repair the old-fashioned highway barrier that lined the inside of the track in that area. Soon afterward, all outdated barriers at the track were replaced with sturdier walls.       2004 : The  SAFER barrier  is installed in all the turns.       2006 : Raybestos Rookie of the Year  Denny Hamlin  sweeps both races at Pocono.       June 6 ,  2008 : Pocono raceway becomes one of the first Nascar tracks in the country to utilize barcode-based ticketing. [ 1 ]       June 2008   James Hylton  becomes the oldest driver to race at Pocono in the  ARCA  series.       August 2 ,  2008 :  Frank Kimmel , a 9-time  ARCA Re/Max Series  champion, was injured after a 3-car crash on lap 68 of a Pocono race that involved his car being clipped and slamming into the backstretch wall on the driver's side, going airborne as a result. Kimmel suffered a partially torn sphincter and pulled groin, spending the night in a local hospital before being released.       [ edit ]   Criticisms   Many fans and drivers contend that the 500-mile races at Pocono take too long, and several Sprint Cup Series drivers recently admitted on FOX that Pocono was the least exciting track on the circuit, including  Denny Hamlin , who swept the races in 2006, and that they would like to see them shortened to 400 miles,  [ 2 ]  but the track does provide some challenges to the racers crew members since they have to figure out the correct setup for all three turns which are completely different from one another. Some fans would not mind seeing the track disappear from the schedule altogether, or at least reduced to one race. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  However, this is unlikely due to Dr. Mattioli's relationship with NASCAR and the track's proximity to both  New York City  and  Philadelphia . Others have called for a  Nationwide Series  or  Craftsman Truck Series  support race to be held at Pocono, since it is one of only two Sprint Cup Series oval tracks (the other being  Indianapolis ) that is not on either the Nationwide Series or Craftsman Truck Series schedule. [ 5 ]  The only support event at Pocono is the  ARCA  series.

[ edit ]   Criticisms   Many fans and drivers contend that the 500-mile races at Pocono take too long, and several Sprint Cup Series drivers recently admitted on FOX that Pocono was the least exciting track on the circuit, including  Denny Hamlin , who swept the races in 2006, and that they would like to see them shortened to 400 miles,  [ 2 ]  but the track does provide some challenges to the racers crew members since they have to figure out the correct setup for all three turns which are completely different from one another. Some fans would not mind seeing the track disappear from the schedule altogether, or at least reduced to one race. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  However, this is unlikely due to Dr. Mattioli's relationship with NASCAR and the track's proximity to both  New York City  and  Philadelphia . Others have called for a  Nationwide Series  or  Craftsman Truck Series  support race to be held at Pocono, since it is one of only two Sprint Cup Series oval tracks (the other being  Indianapolis ) that is not on either the Nationwide Series or Craftsman Truck Series schedule. [ 5 ]  The only support event at Pocono is the  ARCA  series.

It is the site of two annual  NASCAR   Sprint Cup Series  races held just weeks apart in June and August.   Pocono is one of a very few NASCAR tracks not owned by either  Speedway Motorsports, Inc.  or  International Speedway Corporation , the dominant track owners in NASCAR. It is owned by the Mattioli family, which also owns  South Boston Speedway  in  South Boston ,  Virginia .   Outside of the NASCAR races, Pocono is used throughout the year by sports car and motorcycle clubs as well as racing schools. The triangular oval also has three separate infield sections of racetrack - North Course, East Course and South Course. Each of these infield sections use a separate portion of the tri-oval to complete the track. During regular non-race weekends, multiple clubs can use the track by running on different infield sections. Also some of the infield sections can be run in either direction, or multiple infield sections can be put together - such as running the North Course and the South Course and using the tri-oval to connect the two.

From 1971 to 1989, the  United States Auto Club  and the  CART  IndyCar World Series (later the  Champ Car World Series  before its 2008 merger into the  Indy Racing League ) held a 500-mile race at Pocono. In 1989,  Emerson Fittipaldi  set a qualifying track record of 211.715 mph. However, after the 1989 race, the track was criticized for its roughness and lack of safety features, and was removed from the CART schedule.     [ edit ]   Race of Champions   From  1977  to  1991 , Pocono Raceway hosted the  Race of Champions  Modified race. From 1977 to 1979, the race was held on the 2.5 mile triangular superspeedway; from 1980 onward, the three-quarter-mile infield oval was used.  Richie Evans  and George Kent were the leading winners, each winning two of the fifteen RoC events at Pocono. In  1992 , the Race of Champions was moved to  Flemington Raceway .          Victory Lane at Pocono during pre-race ceremonies at the 2005  Pocono 500         [ edit ]   Track configuration   Pocono Raceway has a unique design. Each turn is modeled after turns at 3 different tracks. Turn One (14 degree banking) was modeled after the now defunct  Trenton Speedway , Turn Two (also known as ""The Tunnel Turn"") is like  Indianapolis Motor Speedway  (9 degree banking), and Turn 3 (6 degree banking) is similar to  The Milwaukee Mile . It could be said to be a  tri-oval , but the turns are much more severe than those of a more typical tri-oval such as  Daytona  and the track is really nearly a  triangle . They have been likened somewhat to the hairpin-style turns of road courses. An additional complication is that the three turns are not identical, nor are any of the three straights identical in length. The long frontstretch often requires a gear change due to the high  RPMs  attained. The banking of each turn is considerably less than on many other long ovals. Although the track is long (2.5 miles), the sharp nature of the turns and low banking tends to make the overall speeds much lower than at other tracks of similar lengths, thus  restrictor plates  are not needed here. For its unique characteristics, Pocono is sometimes referred to as a  roval . Others refer to Pocono as a modified road course due to the use of shifting gears to handle the range between the slowest curve and the fastest straightaway.   The odd design makes the setup of the car and the crew's ability to make chassis adjustments even more crucial here than at many other tracks. Often it is the difference between a winning performance and a poor performance. Drivers tend to either love the track or hate it, largely depending on how well it suits their driving style and their crew's abilities.     [ edit ]   Notable Events     August 4 ,  1974 :  Richard Petty  wins the inaugural Pocono 500.       August 1 ,  1976 : Petty scores a popular win after  David Pearson  blows a tire with two laps to go.       1985  Bill Elliott sweeps both Pocono cup races.       1986 - 1987 :  Tim Richmond  wins three Pocono Races in a row. The third and last was the spring race in 1987. Richmond had just returned after missing the first part of the season batteling HIV. Richmond was the first HIV positive race car driver to win a major race, this wasn't revealed for nearly four years.       July 20 ,  1986 :  Tim Richmond  recovers from a crash and beats  Ricky Rudd  and  Geoff Bodine  in a photo finish.       June 19 ,  1988 : On the opening lap of the 1988 Miller High-life 500,  Bobby Allison  suffered career-ending injuries when he spun and was T-boned by the #63 of  Jocko Maggiacomo .       1999 :  Bobby Labonte  sweeps both races at Pocono.       June 18 ,  2000 :  Jeremy Mayfield  knocked the late  Dale Earnhardt  out of his way to score his third career Winston Cup win.       July 28 ,  2002 :  Steve Park  and  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  became entangled exiting turn one, and both cars slammed into the inside wall, causing Park's vehicle to go airborne over the hood of Earnhardt's car and barrel roll. The incident resulted in a lengthy  red flag  to repair the old-fashioned highway barrier that lined the inside of the track in that area. Soon afterward, all outdated barriers at the track were replaced with sturdier walls.       2004 : The  SAFER barrier  is installed in all the turns.       2006 : Raybestos Rookie of the Year  Denny Hamlin  sweeps both races at Pocono.       June 6 ,  2008 : Pocono raceway becomes one of the first Nascar tracks in the country to utilize barcode-based ticketing. [ 1 ]       June 2008   James Hylton  becomes the oldest driver to race at Pocono in the  ARCA  series.       August 2 ,  2008 :  Frank Kimmel , a 9-time  ARCA Re/Max Series  champion, was injured after a 3-car crash on lap 68 of a Pocono race that involved his car being clipped and slamming into the backstretch wall on the driver's side, going airborne as a result.

Spencer , was very fast and got the TQ in the 1/8th buggy class, unfortunately his throttle servo failed and he wasn't able to start the A-main. Sean , ran well in his final race despite the loose condition of his buggy and the fast competition that was gnawing on his tail he closed the deal with a win. Ron , ran over his competition and finished first with about a 5 lap lead. Noah , had everyones attention when he and Bobby Wood, fought tooth and nail, they came across the loop 3 times tied and Noah won the main by only 0.8 seconds.  It was one of the best races that I've had the pleasure of watching. David Meyer , won the CTR main with pit strategy, he took the lead away from Bobby Wood by skipping the last pit stop. :)                                                                                                                     sherm                                           Latest page update:  made by  sherm                 ,  Feb 18 2008, 10:25 AM EST              ( about this update                 About This Update                                                                             Moved from: My R/C Racing News                                                  -  sherm                                                                                        No content added or deleted.                                                                      -              complete history )                                     Keyword tags:             ascot         bags         dirt         sweep            More Info:  links to this page           Bookmark:          Del.icio.us                  StumbleUpon                  Facebook                                                               Post a new thread                          Threads                      There are no threads for this page.                                                                          Related Content         ( what's this?

He is named after  Glenn McQueen , a Pixar Animator who died of  melanoma  in October 2002. His overall profile was inspired by  stock cars  and a ""more curvaceous  Le Mans endurance  racer"", e.g.,  Lola  and  Ford GT40 . [ 1 ]  His number, 95, is a reference to the year Pixar released its first feature-length movie,  Toy Story . In the beginning of the film, Lightning McQueen is a narcissistic, selfish race car, especially towards his pit crew. He hopes to be the first rookie to win the Piston Cup race and gain a lucrative endorsement deal from Dinoco in the final race of the season, but finishes in a three-way tie with perennial runner-up  Chick Hicks  and veteran  Strip ""The King"" Weathers  after losing his huge lead on the final lap (#400) because of two blown tires. He gets lost in Radiator Springs on his way to California and meets new friends who teach him there is more to life than winning car races and gaining deals. It is there he meets Mater and falls in love with the town attorney, Sally Carrera. He changes his look at the end of the movie, while his bad attitude changes during his time in Radiator Springs. He learns these valuable lessons: true friendship; how greed affects others; keeping promises; teamwork; and that life is about the journey, not the destination. These values lead him to rejuvenate Radiator Springs back to its heyday. Therefore, he decides to call the little town his home, and the headquarters of Team Lightning McQueen which gets finished in  Cars Mater-National  and Mater called it a club house, but he started to cry after Lightning called it headquarters, which is referred to be called ""Lightning's Racing Headquarters"".     [ edit ]   Mack   Mack  is a 1980s-era  Mack Super-Liner  truck bearing license plate ""RUSTEZ3"", voiced by  John Ratzenberger . A dedicated member of the Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment Team, Mack pulls  Lightning McQueen 's trailer to his races. After McQueen's entire pit team quits, Mack remains as the rookie racer's only friend. McQueen exhorts Mack to drive through the night to his tiebreaker race with  Chick Hicks  and  Strip Weathers  in  Los Angeles, California , hoping to reach the venue first and to hang out with the  Dinoco  team. During the long drive, Mack falls asleep and falls victim to the  Delinquent Road Hazards , a group of reckless street racers. The Delinquent Road Hazards knock Mack all over the road, causing one of McQueen's bobble heads to fall off its perch and hit a button, opening his trailer door and dump a sleeping McQueen onto the road. When Mack wakes up, he is unaware that McQueen has gotten lost and has ended up in  Radiator Springs . Eventually, Mack travels to  Radiator Springs  and, under threat of being fired by McQueen's agent,  Harv , transports McQueen to Los Angeles. There he serves as McQueen's pit crew until a group of McQueen's friends from Radiator Springs show up to help. After the race, Mack moves to  Radiator Springs  with McQueen and is shown at Flo's Cafe in the short film  Mater and the Ghostlight , as well as in the video game based on the film.   John Ratzenberger was given the part in honor of his father, who drove a Mack truck. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Lightning McQueen's pit crew   Lightning McQueen's pit crew  are generic  forklifts  who quit after McQueen didn't go to the pits for tires, which nearly cost him the season's final race. One of them, presumably the acting  crew chief , since the official crew chief had recently been fired, is referred to by McQueen as ""Chuck"", who retorts angrily afterwards, ""And my name is not Chuck!"" In the credits, he is referred to as ""Not Chuck"" and is voiced by  Mike Nelson .     [ edit ]   Harv   Harv  is  Lightning McQueen 's agent. Never seen on-screen, McQueen speaks to Harv via his speaker phone when McQueen and  Mack  are en route to the tiebreaker race and again when Mack is in Radiator Springs to pick up McQueen. Harv is voiced by actor  Jeremy Piven  and is based on his character  Ari Gold  from the  HBO  series  Entourage . In the United Kingdom edition of the movie Harv is voiced by the well-known motoring journalist  Jeremy Clarkson . This equivalent of Harv is implied by Clarkson to be a 1979  Ford Granada  sedan, while the American version is said to be a 1996  Oldsmobile .     [ edit ]   Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze   The  Rust-eze Brothers ,  Rusty  and  Dusty , are the spokescars for Rust-Eze, the team that sponsors Lightning. Rusty is a 1964  Dodge A100 , and Dusty, a 1963  Dodge Dart . Rusty and Dusty are voiced by real lfe Brothers  Tom Magliozzi  and  Ray Magliozzi  (respectively) of  National Public Radio 's  Car Talk . The '63 Dart bears an intentional resemblance to Ray Magliozzi's infamous green Dart, named ""The Dartre"". In a deleted scene shown on the DVD, these two would have had no association with  Lightning McQueen  other than a chance encounter at a  truck stop , where Mack was allowed to stop briefly. According to their respective die-cast, Rusty's license plate states ""Rust"" and Dusty's sports ""Eze"". The license plates also show that they're from ""R Fair City"", a reference to how the brothers refer to their hometown of  Cambridge, Massachusetts  on  Car Talk .     [ edit ]   Dinoco team     [ edit ]   Strip ""The King"" Weathers   Strip Weathers  (simply known as  The King ) is a Dinoco Blue veteran  racecar  voiced by  NASCAR  veteran  Richard Petty . He is based on Petty's  1970   Plymouth Superbird ; his number, 43, was Petty's racecar number. He is one of the racecars in the 2005 Piston Cup three-way tie, along with  Chick Hicks  and  Lightning McQueen . His crew chief shouts, "" McQueen's blown a tire, McQueen's blown a tire go go go go go go!"" He is Dinoco's ""Golden Boy"", having won seven Piston Cups, and is hoping for another win in the tie-breaker race. He tells  Lightning McQueen  that he would be nowhere without his team, but the rookie does not pay any attention, being more preoccupied with the thought of taking over the Dinoco sponsorship after The King's retirement. On the final lap of the tie-breaker race, Chick rammed The King sending him into a terrible rollover crash. When McQueen saw what happened, he realised that The King's career might end like  Doc Hudson 's did. So after deliberately letting Chick win, McQueen helped The King to the finish line. He was last seen in the racing museum with his wife and another NASCAR racer,  Dale Jr .     [ edit ]   Lynda Weathers / Mrs. The King   ""Mrs. The King"" , as Mater calls her, is The King's wife. She is voiced by Richard Petty's real-life wife,  Lynda Petty . A 1974  Chrysler Town and Country  station wagon, she is modeled after the car in which the Petty family used to go to Richard's races during the 1970s. During the races, she sits in a special VIP booth with Dinoco's sponsor, cheering for her husband.     [ edit ]   Tex Dinoco   Tex Dinoco , voiced by  Humpy Wheeler , is a gold 1975  Cadillac Coupe de Ville  and owner of  Dinoco . In his packaging as a diecast car, his name is listed as ""Tex Dinoco"". It is unknown whether Dinoco is Tex's last name, or whether the name was simply added to give the consumer a better idea of who Tex was. Tex was mainly inspired by the gold Cadillacs with Long Horns that are used at the Big Texan Steak Restaurant in Amarillo, Texas to bring guests for dinner.     [ edit ]   Hostile Takeover Bank team     [ edit ]   Chick Hicks   Chick Hicks  (voiced by  Michael Keaton ) is an obnoxious green  GM G platform (RWD) , most likely a  Buick Regal , that was popular in the 1980s. He has spent his entire career coming in behind Strip ""The King"" Weathers, and is bitter about this fact. His number is 86 (86 stands for eighty-sixed, a reference of firing someone, it also means 1986, which is his model year and also the year  Pixar  was established). Determined to do whatever it takes to win, he will often ram other cars in order to cause a wreck. He hates Lightning McQueen; however, he does tend to copy him. He uses the nickname Thunder which McQueen created saying ""Thunder always comes after Lightning"". Chick and McQueen share the same dream of being the new face of Dinoco. On the final lap of the tie-breaker race, Chick Hicks becomes so determined not to come in behind The King again that he rams The King off the track, sending The King tumbling for some miles in a large wreck. He expects a huge ovation after McQueen deliberately lets him win the Piston Cup, but is booed off the stage instead, denied the opportunity to represent Dinoco, and forced to make a quick getaway with his trophy. In many ways, he represents what Lightning McQueen could have become.     [ edit ]   Radiator Springs populace     [ edit ]   Mater          a custom  real life version  of mater.       Mater  (voiced by  Larry the Cable Guy ) was inspired by a  1951   International Harvester [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  tow truck but bears more of a resemblance to a 1955-57  Chevrolet  or  GMC ; the actual inspiration may be the 1955-56 version since the hood which Mater recovers at the end of the film after a twenty-year absence lacks the ""gunsights"" of the 1957 model. Mater runs ""Tow Mater Towing and Salvage."" Along with the movie, he also stars in an animated short,  Mater and the Ghostlight , and acts as an announcer in the  Cars  video game. He speaks with a thick Southern accent with a bit of hillbilly  twang , and often misspells words or uses incorrect syntax. Mater is also the (self-proclaimed) world champion backwards driver. He attributes his skill to his rear-view mirrors and his own philosophy: ""Don't need to know where I'm going, just need to know where I've been."" In the movie, Mater befriends and supports Lightning throughout his adventure in Radiator Springs. In the end, McQueen gives Mater an opportunity to fly in a Dinoco helicopter like he always wanted.   His color was originally  baby blue , as shown in a flashback; however, over the years, he has rusted into a patchwork light brown/orange color, with some of the blue still showing through. He is missing his hood and his left headlight. In the credits he managed to fish his hood (which has more of its original color on it than the rest of Mater does) from a cliff up in Tailfin Pass, but then sneezed, causing it to fall back down the cliff. His license plate number is  A113 ; the passenger locomotive which nearly crashes into McQueen before his initial entry into Radiator Springs bears the same number on its identification plates. His final personality was based on his voice actor, Larry the Cable Guy, and he uses many of Larry's catchphrases, including ""Git-R-Done"" during the final race sequence and ""I don't care who you are; that's funny right there"" during the  tractor tipping  scene, among others.   Real life replicas of Mater and Lightning are shown at  Disney's California Adventure  at  Disneyland Resort  in  Anaheim, CA  and  Disney's Hollywood Studios  of  Walt Disney World  in  Lake Buena Vista, FL . In addition unofficial replicas have been created by fans of the movie. [ 5 ]   The original vehicle on which Mater's appearance was based [ 6 ]  currently sits at the ""Four Women on the Route"" diner and souvenir store in  Galena, KS . [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Sally Carrera          Sally Carrera       Sally Carrera  (voiced by  Bonnie Hunt ) is a  royal blue  2002  Porsche 911 Carrera . Her California license plate number is 301PCE. She also appears in the  Cars  video game , in which she is a playable character. Sally,  Lightning McQueen 's love interest and later girlfriend, is the snazzy town attorney of  Radiator Springs . She came to the town several years before, when, in her own words, ""I never felt... happy. One day I just drove and drove, and finally broke down right here. Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in... well, they all did. And I never left."" Sally then fell in love with the town, and the land around it, and settled down in the town. Sally runs the Cozy Cone Motel. Later, she and Lightning reopened the Wheel Well Hotel. She calls McQueen ""Stickers,"" first as a way to tease him (because of his fake headlights), and later as a friendly nickname. In the UK cars magazine  Top Gear , Sally was included in the magazine's list of the 10 sexiest cars in the World [ citation needed ] .     [ edit ]   Doc Hudson   Doc Hudson  (voiced by  Paul Newman ); also known as  ""Dr. Hudson""  or simply  ""Doc"" . His license plate reads 51HHMD (a reference to his year and track number(51) model (Hudson Hornet) and profession (medical doctor)). Doc was once known as the  Fabulous Hudson Hornet  (#51), one of the most famous racecars to have ever lived; he won three Piston Cups, and still holds the record for most wins in a single season (27, a reference to real-life Hornets winning 27  NASCAR  races in 1952). All that changed for the famous Hornet when a terrible crash on the track at the qualifying race in 1954 saw him put out for the season. Upon his return, he was received with a complete absence of fanfare and told that he was a has-been who had been passed up for the next rookie in line. He kept a newspaper article on the career-ending crash as a reminder never to return to the life that nearly killed him.   Jaded by the racing scene, he left that world, apparently taking out time to study medicine. The famous #51 disappeared into obscurity, leaving many wondering where he had gone. He instead opted for a simple  navy blue  paint job and the life of a  physician  in the tiny town of  Radiator Springs , the ""shining  Gemstone "" of the Mother Road -  Route 66 . He runs Doc's Clinic as a ""doctor of  internal combustion "". As times changed and the town got bypassed in favor of  Interstate 40 , Doc stayed on, even when the population had dwindled to a meager dozen or so residents. He is respected, well-loved, and serves not only as the town's physician, but as its judge as well. However, nobody in the town had any idea of his past as a racer; he was just an ordinary  Hudson Hornet  to them.   Upon meeting the young hotshot  Lightning McQueen , Doc saw far too much of his past in the rookie. After McQueen finished fixing the road he damaged and decided to stay for a while, Doc was unable to bear having him around any longer and called the news and press to immediately take him away to the Piston Cup, declaring that it is best for everyone. But seeing how disheartened everyone was by his unplanned departure, Doc realized that McQueen had become more important to them than he thought. He took back his old #51 colors to become McQueen's pit crew chief, bringing nearly the entire town to the Piston Cup to support Lightning as his pit crew. By the end of the film, Doc opts to keep his racing colors, and becomes a trainer as well as crew chief to the young McQueen. Just like McQueen, Doc learned some lessons: friendship, promises, how greed affects others, and that secrets can't be kept forever.   The car is based on the real-life  Fabulous Hudson Hornet  in NASCAR competition driven by  Herb Thomas  and  Marshall Teague .     [ edit ]   Sheriff   Sheriff  (voiced by  Michael Wallis ) is a 1949  Mercury Club Coupe   police car , bearing Carburetor County license plate  001 . Sheriff is painted in the classic law enforcement black and white, with a single red light dome, two  sirens , and  curb feelers . Sheriff was the first resident of  Radiator Springs  to appear in the film and also the first to meet  Lightning McQueen  during a police chase when McQueen was speeding through the town, trying to find  Mack . He later befriends Lightning McQueen, even offering him a police escort to California, and joins his pit crew for the championship race.     [ edit ]   Luigi   Luigi  (voiced by  Tony Shalhoub ) is a 1959  Fiat 500  ragtop. He is a  Scuderia Ferrari  fan, and has followed racing his entire life. His license plate reads 445-108, which is the latitude and longitude for the main  Ferrari  factory in  Modena ,  Italy .  [ 8 ]  Luigi owns a tire shop, Casa Della Tires, which is known for its ""Leaning Tower of Tires,"" a tower of several tires shaped like the  Leaning Tower of Pisa . His assistant is an Italian  forklift truck  named  Guido . Inside his shop are many framed pictures of  World Sportscar Championship   endurance racing  Ferraris from various points in history. At first, Luigi and Guido do not respect  Lightning McQueen  when he comes to  Radiator Springs , because he is not a Ferrari (""Luigi follow only the Ferraris""), but later on they learn to show courtesy to McQueen, fitting him with whitewalls. In the end, McQueen directs a group of Italian sports cars comprised of a Ferrari (voiced by  Michael Schumacher ) and two  Maseratis  to his shop, having recommended it. His car model is also a pun on Fiat's sponsorship for Ferrari at Formula One.   For the Italian version of the film, Luigi was voiced by comedian Marco Della Noce; one of Della Noce's most popular characters was ""Oriano Ferrari"", a parody character meant to represent the leader of Ferrari's pit stop crew. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Guido   Guido  (voiced by  Guido Quaroni ) is a  forklift , who works at Luigi's Casa Della Tires, and is Luigi's best friend. The only language Guido can speak and understand fluently is  Italian , though he appears to understand  English , and even speaks a few phrases, including ""Pit stop"" but pronounced ""Peet Stop!"". His dream is to perform a  pit stop  for a real racecar. Near the end of the movie, as Lightning's pit crew, he performed the fastest pit stop in Piston Cup history, changing all four tires in four seconds.   In order to preserve the ""language barrier"" gags between Guido and the other characters in the Italian dub, his lines (and the other cars' lines in Italian) have been rendered with the  Emiliano-Romagnolo  accent spoken in the town of  Modena , Italy, home of the  Ferrari  car manufacturer and racing team.  Alex Zanardi , an Italian race driver who is a native of Bologna, the largest city in the Emilia-Romagna region (and thus presumably familiar with that dialect), voiced Guido for the Italian version. Coincidentally, or as a pun by the authors, the name ""Guido"" is a perfect  homonym  for the Italian inflected verb meaning ""I drive"".     [ edit ]   Ramone   Ramone  (voiced by  Cheech Marin ) is a 1959  Chevrolet Impala   lowrider  who owns the Ramone's Paint and Body Art store, where he paints himself and other cars, including  Lightning McQueen  later in the film. His license plate reads ""L0WNSL0"", which is a reference to his catchphrase, ""low and slow"". He is married to  Flo , whose restaurant is next door to his store. Ramone is usually depicted purple with a yellow and orange flame job, but throughout the film he changes his paint job every morning to keep his skills sharp, owing to a lack of customers. This situation changes after Radiator Springs becomes vibrant again.   In a deleted scene that told the story of how Ramone and Flo fell in love, the only customer Ramone has refused to paint was his future wife Flo. When she asked him, ""Whassamatta, you too good to paint me?"" he promptly and smoothly replies, ""No way, you too good for me to paint"", and saying that he couldn't paint a classic like Flo, which made her heart melt. The story took place in Radiator Springs of 1974.     [ edit ]   Flo   Flo  (voiced by  Jenifer Lewis ) is the owner of  Radiator Springs  only gas diner, ""Flo's V-8  Cafe "" and is married to  Ramone , the town's body artist. Her license plate reads ""SHOGRL"", the same as the license plates applied to many  Motorama  show cars, and an obvious pun on the term "" showgirl "". A shot of Flo's rear end during the cruising scene shows a secondary plate above her license plate which reads ""Motorama 1957."" According to a deleted scene, she is indeed a Motorama showcar and came to  Radiator Springs  during a national tour. She appears to be inspired by three early- to mid-fifties show cars: the  1951 Buick LeSabre  (front-end lines, the basic hood shape, lights mounted near the corners, and front-quarter trim), the 1951 Buick XP-300 (side trim), and the 1956/57 Chrysler Dart (cockpit, deck lid, and tailfins). [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Fillmore   Fillmore  (voiced by  George Carlin ) is a  Volkswagen Type 2  microbus of late 1950s/early 1960s vintage as evidenced by his pointed front turn signals and small rear window. Fillmore's license plate reads ""51237"", which is a reference to  May 12 ,  1937 , the birthdate of George Carlin. It is also the ZIP Code of  George, Iowa . He is a stereotypical  hippie , with his license plate positioned to resemble a  soul patch . He owns an  organic fuel  shop (Filmore's Organic Fuel) which features several flavors, and believes gasoline companies are lying to the public. In the morning, when next-door neighbor Sarge plays  Reveille  and raises the  Flag of the United States , Fillmore interrupts Sarge's bugle  reveille  with  Jimi Hendrix 's rendition of "" The Star-Spangled Banner ."" This is much to Sarge's irritation, as he shouts at Fillmore:     Sarge : ""Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?!""   Fillmore : ""Respect the classics man, it's Hendrix.""     Despite this, he is friends with Sarge, and the two can be seen chatting throughout the film.   He has a sticker on his rear that says ""I brake for Jackalopes"". The  jackalope  is a mythical creature which features in the theatrical short "" Boundin' "" shown with  The Incredibles .     [ edit ]   Sarge          Sarge       Sarge  (voiced by  Paul Dooley ) is a  Willys   Jeep . A veteran with a military green paint job and a slightly stylized  Sergeant Major  (E-9) insignia on his sides, he appears to be a  World War II  era  Willys MB . His license plate reads ""41WW2"", which indicates the date the Willys MB entered the service of the U.S. Army (1941 World War II). He runs a surplus store, named "" Sarge's Surplus Hut "", next door to Fillmore. Near the end of the film, it is revealed he later opens an Army Camp to train SUVs and 4x4s in rugged and dirt terrain, including Murphy and Frank ""Pinky"" Pinkerton.     [ edit ]   Lizzie   Lizzie  (voiced by  Katherine Helmond ), a 1923  Ford Model T  coupe, is the widow of Radiator Springs' founder, Stanley, and the elderly owner of a roadside souvenir and accessory shop (Radiator Springs Curios). Her license plate, ""MT23"", is a reference to her model and year. Her name is derived from  Tin Lizzie , one of the Model T's popular nicknames. She appears to have gone somewhat  senile , and has a crush on  Lightning McQueen .     [ edit ]   Red   Red  (voiced by  Joe Ranft ) sometimes called  Big Red , is a mid-1960s  closed-cab pumper  bearing Carburetor County license plate ""002."" He is shy and emotional, often bursting into tears and/or hiding whenever he is upset. He spends most of his time  gardening  and washing things, such as the statue of Stanley next to his  fire station . It was stated by Mater that Red hated McQueen for accidentally killing his flowers, but it is clear that Red had forgiven McQueen and warmed up to him, especially since he burst into tears and fled when he thought McQueen left without saying goodbye (which he didn't, but was, unfortunately, forced to do later). Joe Ranft died in a car accident in 2005, shortly before the movie was released. Red is absent in the video game.     [ edit ]   Stanley   Stanley  is Lizzie's late husband and was the founder of Radiator Springs. Stanley was probably a  Stanley Steamer , a steam-driven automobile. A statue of Stanley stands outside the town hall, and although it was broken off its pedestal and dragged through the streets on a cable by Lightning McQueen, it was fortunately not damaged, and another mishap placed the statue right back where it was. Although  dead , Stanley continues to exert an influence on the town, particularly over Lizzie, who often talks to his statue in memory of him.     [ edit ]   Frank   Frank  is a generic orange  combine harvester  that resembles a bull, and the guardian of the tractors. After  Lightning McQueen 's first encounter with Frank during a night of tractor tipping with Mater, Lightning has a nightmare that he, The King, and  Chick Hicks  (the last of whom does not even survive in the nightmare) are beaten by Frank in the tie-breaker race after beginning to feel that he is being distracted by his time in Radiator Springs. He is last seen with the tractors at the drive-in theatre scenes. He is also seen in the short  Mater and the Ghostlight  when Mater races past him, waking him up.     [ edit ]   Announcers     [ edit ]   Darrell Cartrip   Darrell Cartrip  is an announcer at the Piston Cup races. He is a 1977  Chevrolet Monte Carlo , and a former Piston Cup Racer. His name is a play on  Darrell Waltrip , who provides the character's voice. Cartrip utters, ""Boogity boogity boogity!"" as the tiebreaker race starts; the real-life Waltrip is also known to use the phrase at the start of every  NASCAR  race. Cartrip appears in the  Cars  video game as the sole announcer; he is also a playable character in the Piston Cup VS. and Arcade mode. On his side it says, ""Boogity boogity boogity"" and on the back of him it says, ""DWstore.com"". These do not appear in the video game. The car is based on a real-life 1977 Monte Carlo Waltrip drove with DiGard Racing, although it does not have the actual paint scheme (which is owned by Pepsico, the successor to the team's sponsor at the time). The most famous of those cars was the infamous ""Bertha,"" which is at the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in Dallas, Teaxes     [ edit ]   Bob Cutlass   Bob Cutlass  is an announcer at the Piston Cup races and friend of Darrell Cartrip. He is voiced by  Bob Costas , the renowned  NBC  sportscaster and journalist and his name, like Darrell Cartrip's, is a play on that of his voice actor. Although the character's name is a reference to the  Oldsmobile Cutlass , Cutlass is actually shown to be an  Oldsmobile Aurora .     [ edit ]   Other vehicles     [ edit ]   Mia and Tia   Mia , (voiced by  Lindsey Collins ), and  Tia , (voiced by  Elissa Knight ), are identical twin 1990-1997  Mazda Miata  sisters who are  Lightning McQueen 's self-proclaimed biggest fans. They are, however, quite fickle; after McQueen's disappearance, the twins suddenly become ardent fans of  Chick Hicks . By the end of the movie, they are McQueen's fans once more, turning against Hicks after he deliberately caused  Strip ""The King"" Weathers  to crash in the tie-breaker race. Mia and Tia eventually moved to Radiator Springs and work as waitresses at Flo's V8 Cafe. In a deleted scene on the  Cars  DVD, the twins were waitresses at a truck stop at which McQueen stopped.   When they first meet Lightning, Mia and Tia flash their headlights at him, similar to groupies pulling up their shirts to  flash  celebrities.     [ edit ]   Van and Minny   Van  (voiced by  Richard Kind ) and  Minny  (voiced by  Edie McClurg ) are husband and wife. They are lost and pass through Radiator Springs while trying to find their way back to Interstate 40. Van refuses to ask directions, claiming not to need them due to having a  GPS , and both of them are equipped with  car alarms , which they arm after their encounter with Lightning McQueen when he begs them to call for help. After the end of the credits, we find out that Van and Minny have ended up somewhere lost in the desert, having never asked for directions, and Van has almost been driven to  insanity . Their names combined is a pun on "" minivan "". Van appears to be a 2003  Ford Windstar  and Minny is a 1995  Dodge Caravan .     [ edit ]   Delinquent Road Hazards   The  Delinquent Road Hazards  are a group of three import cars and an American muscle car, based on a 1994  Mitsubishi Eclipse , 2000  Nissan Silvia , 2004  Scion xB  (Boost, Wingo, and DJ respectively) and a 1970  Plymouth Barracuda  muscle car (Snot Rod) that cause trouble on the roads. The four of them cause Mack to run off the road, dumping the sleeping McQueen out of his trailer. During the credits, they are apprehended by Sheriff and sentenced to community service (patching up the road).     [ edit ]   Kori Turbowitz   Kori Turbowitz  (voiced by San Francisco Bay Area DJ  Sarah Clark ) is a 1997  Ford Puma ; a news reporter who shows up in the movie three times.     [ edit ]   Jay Limo   Jay Limo , like his voice actor  Jay Leno , is a talk show host. He resembles a 1999  Maybach 57 , He remarks ""I don't know what's harder to find;  Lightning McQueen  or a crew chief who'll work with him!""     [ edit ]   Albert Hinkey   Albert Hinkey  (voiced by Douglas ""Mater"" Keever [ 11 ] ) is an  RV  that proclaims that he is Lightning's biggest fan. He is seen in the background of races. He has another friend that is a fan of Lightning also that is voiced by Larry Benton.     [ edit ]   Fred   Fred  (voiced by  Andrew Stanton ) Fred is a starstruck, very rusty old car. Everybody knows his name, because his license plate says ""FRED."" When McQueen says his name, he shouts, ""He knows my name! He knows my name"" and, in his excitement, his front bumper falls off. Later, when he is unable to gain access to the tie-breaker race and Mario Andretti (who would be waved through the gate on sight as a celebrity) likewise reads his license plate, Fred says, ""Mario Andretti knows my name! You gotta let me in now!"" He was seen again in the end credits spinning around in a circle with rust falling out from under him. When he stopped, his front bumper fell off again.     [ edit ]   TJ Hummer   TJ Hummer  is a vain  Hummer H1  that Sarge teaches in his boot camp during the end of the movie. He refuses to go off road, but Sarge forces him to do so.     [ edit ]   Elvis   Elvis  (voiced by  Sheryl Crow ) is a camper van that acts like  Elvis Presley . His only line is, ""Uh!"" (which is part of the song ""Real Gone"", also by Sheryl Crow) and he is seen in the first part of the movie and briefly on the stadium of the tie-breaker race. He has the Elvis trademark coif and his bodywork is painted like a sparkling suit.     [ edit ]   Sven ""The Governator""   Sven ""The Governator""  (based on and voiced by  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) is a Hummer. His only line is ""Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!"" The name and vehicle refers to Schwarzenegger's job as California governor and the fact that he was one of the first Hummer H1 owners.     [ edit ]   Michael Schumacher   Michael Schumacher  is a 2006 Ferrari F430 sports car voiced by Schumacher himself. He appears at Luigi's shop at the end of the movie after being told by Lightning McQueen that ""this is the best place in the world to buy tires"", and asks to order a few sets of tires for himself and a pair of Maserati Quattroportes who accompany him. After Luigi faints from the excitement of having ""a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in his store"", Schumacher speaks to Guido in Italian, and Guido subsequently faints. The phrase he speaks is in Italian, ""I hope that your friend is okay, I hear that you're the best.""     [ edit ]   Jerry Recycled Batteries   Jerry  (voiced by Joe Ranft) is a 1979  Peterbilt  352 that Lightning McQueen mistook for Mack. He has the words ""Recycled Batteries"" on his side.     [ edit ]   Bessie   Bessie  is a tarmac laying machine that is used to fix roads. When  Lightning McQueen  accidentally destroyed the road with the statue of Stanley, the residents of  Radiator Springs  sentenced him to fix the road with her. She was later seen at the end of the movie when the Delinquent Road Hazards had to fix the road with her as punishment for speeding. Sometimes Bessie boils over and splats tar onto the car(s) pulling her. Bessie is the only vehicle that can't move by itself in the film.     [ edit ]   Film-within-a-film characters   Main article:  List of Pixar film references     [ edit ]   Piston Cup officials     [ edit ]   Lightyear Blimp (Al Oft)   The  Lightyear Blimp  (a parody of the  Goodyear blimp ), is a  blimp  whose name is  Al Oft . His only line is ""Oh yeah, Whoo!"" He flies above the racetrack and tapes overhead footage of the race with his video camera. The title is also a reference to Buzz Lightyear from  Toy Story . His name, Al Oft, is a reference to ""aloft"" meaning in flight.     [ edit ]   Other racecars     [ edit ]   Dale Earnhardt Jr. #8   Dale Earnhardt Jr. #8 , is a Piston Cup racecar. He is voiced by  Dale Earnhardt Jr. , and closely resembles Dale's #8  NASCAR  car, with the exception that the  Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)  stickers are replaced by  Dale Earnhardt Inc.  stickers to avoid advertising beer in the film. He is a 2003  Chevrolet Monte Carlo  stock car. Junior was first seen in the race at the beginning of the film where he was approching the track and is later seen in the pits. He was seen again during the ""McQueen's Missing"" scene saying that he hoped that Lightning was OK, then at the tie-breaker Junior is seen wishing  The King  good luck in his last race. Junior was last seen at the Radiator Springs racing museum with The King and his wife Lynda.     [ edit ]   Mario Andretti #11   Mario Andretti  voices his eponymous character, who is a former racecar that believes every day is a great day for racing. He is based on the 1967  Ford Fairlane  that the real Andretti drove to Victory in the 1967 Daytona 500.

He is named after  Glenn McQueen , a Pixar Animator who died of  melanoma  in October 2002. His overall profile was inspired by  stock cars  and a ""more curvaceous  Le Mans endurance  racer"", e.g.,  Lola  and  Ford GT40 . [ 1 ]  His number, 95, is a reference to the year Pixar released its first feature-length movie,  Toy Story . In the beginning of the film, Lightning McQueen is a narcissistic, selfish race car, especially towards his pit crew. He hopes to be the first rookie to win the Piston Cup race and gain a lucrative endorsement deal from Dinoco in the final race of the season, but finishes in a three-way tie with perennial runner-up  Chick Hicks  and veteran  Strip ""The King"" Weathers  after losing his huge lead on the final lap (#400) because of two blown tires. He gets lost in Radiator Springs on his way to California and meets new friends who teach him there is more to life than winning car races and gaining deals. It is there he meets Mater and falls in love with the town attorney, Sally Carrera. He changes his look at the end of the movie, while his bad attitude changes during his time in Radiator Springs. He learns these valuable lessons: true friendship; how greed affects others; keeping promises; teamwork; and that life is about the journey, not the destination. These values lead him to rejuvenate Radiator Springs back to its heyday. Therefore, he decides to call the little town his home, and the headquarters of Team Lightning McQueen which gets finished in  Cars Mater-National  and Mater called it a club house, but he started to cry after Lightning called it headquarters, which is referred to be called ""Lightning's Racing Headquarters"".     [ edit ]   Mack=   Mack  is a 1980s-era  Mack Super-Liner  truck bearing license plate ""RUSTEZ3"", voiced by  John Ratzenberger . A dedicated member of the Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment Team, Mack pulls  Lightning McQueen 's trailer to his races. After McQueen's entire pit team quits, Mack remains as the rookie racer's only friend. McQueen exhorts Mack to drive through the night to his tiebreaker race with  Chick Hicks  and  Strip Weathers  in  Los Angeles, California , hoping to reach the venue first and to hang out with the  Dinoco  team. During the long drive, Mack falls asleep and falls victim to the  Delinquent Road Hazards , a group of reckless street racers. The Delinquent Road Hazards knock Mack all over the road, causing one of McQueen's bobble heads to fall off its perch and hit a button, opening his trailer door and dump a sleeping McQueen onto the road. When Mack wakes up, he is unaware that McQueen has gotten lost and has ended up in  Radiator Springs . Eventually, Mack travels to  Radiator Springs  and, under threat of being fired by McQueen's agent,  Harv , transports McQueen to Los Angeles. There he serves as McQueen's pit crew until a group of McQueen's friends from Radiator Springs show up to help. After the race, Mack moves to  Radiator Springs  with McQueen and is shown at Flo's Cafe in the short film  Mater and the Ghostlight , as well as in the video game based on the film.   John Ratzenberger was given the part in honor of his father, who drove a Mack truck. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Lightning McQueen's pit crew   Lightning McQueen's pit crew  are generic  forklifts  who quit after McQueen didn't go to the pits for tires, which nearly cost him the season's final race. One of them, presumably the acting  crew chief , since the official crew chief had recently been fired, is referred to by McQueen as ""Chuck"", who retorts angrily afterwards, ""And my name is not Chuck!"" In the credits, he is referred to as ""Not Chuck"" and is voiced by  Mike Nelson .     [ edit ]   Harv   Harv  is  Lightning McQueen 's agent. Never seen on-screen, McQueen speaks to Harv via his speaker phone when McQueen and  Mack  are en route to the tiebreaker race and again when Mack is in Radiator Springs to pick up McQueen. Harv is voiced by actor  Jeremy Piven  and is based on his character  Ari Gold  from the  HBO  series  Entourage . In the United Kingdom edition of the movie Harv is voiced by the well-known motoring journalist  Jeremy Clarkson . This equivalent of Harv is implied by Clarkson to be a 1979  Ford Granada  sedan, while the American version is said to be a 1996  Oldsmobile .     [ edit ]   Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze   The  Rust-eze Brothers ,  Rusty  and  Dusty , are the spokescars for Rust-Eze, the team that sponsors Lightning. Rusty is a 1964  Dodge A100 , and Dusty, a 1963  Dodge Dart . Rusty and Dusty are voiced by real lfe Brothers  Tom Magliozzi  and  Ray Magliozzi  (respectively) of  National Public Radio 's  Car Talk . The '63 Dart bears an intentional resemblance to Ray Magliozzi's infamous green Dart, named ""The Dartre"". In a deleted scene shown on the DVD, these two would have had no association with  Lightning McQueen  other than a chance encounter at a  truck stop , where Mack was allowed to stop briefly. According to their respective die-cast, Rusty's license plate states ""Rust"" and Dusty's sports ""Eze"". The license plates also show that they're from ""R Fair City"", a reference to how the brothers refer to their hometown of  Cambridge, Massachusetts  on  Car Talk .     [ edit ]   Dinoco team     [ edit ]   Strip ""The King"" Weathers   Strip Weathers  (simply known as  The King ) is a Dinoco Blue veteran  racecar  voiced by  NASCAR  veteran  Richard Petty . He is based on Petty's  1970   Plymouth Superbird ; his number, 43, was Petty's racecar number. He is one of the racecars in the 2005 Piston Cup three-way tie, along with  Chick Hicks  and  Lightning McQueen . His crew chief shouts, "" McQueen's blown a tire, McQueen's blown a tire go go go go go go!"" He is Dinoco's ""Golden Boy"", having won seven Piston Cups, and is hoping for another win in the tie-breaker race. He tells  Lightning McQueen  that he would be nowhere without his team, but the rookie does not pay any attention, being more preoccupied with the thought of taking over the Dinoco sponsorship after The King's retirement. On the final lap of the tie-breaker race, Chick rammed The King sending him into a terrible rollover crash. When McQueen saw what happened, he realised that The King's career might end like  Doc Hudson 's did. So after deliberately letting Chick win, McQueen helped The King to the finish line. He was last seen in the racing museum with his wife and another NASCAR racer,  Dale Jr .     [ edit ]   Lynda Weathers / Mrs. The King   ""Mrs. The King"" , as Mater calls her, is The King's wife. She is voiced by Richard Petty's real-life wife,  Lynda Petty . A 1974  Chrysler Town and Country  station wagon, she is modeled after the car in which the Petty family used to go to Richard's races during the 1970s. During the races, she sits in a special VIP booth with Dinoco's sponsor, cheering for her husband.     [ edit ]   Tex Dinoco   Tex Dinoco , voiced by  Humpy Wheeler , is a gold 1975  Cadillac Coupe de Ville  and owner of  Dinoco . In his packaging as a diecast car, his name is listed as ""Tex Dinoco"". It is unknown whether Dinoco is Tex's last name, or whether the name was simply added to give the consumer a better idea of who Tex was. Tex was mainly inspired by the gold Cadillacs with Long Horns that are used at the Big Texan Steak Restaurant in Amarillo, Texas to bring guests for dinner.     [ edit ]   Hostile Takeover Bank team     [ edit ]   Chick Hicks   Chick Hicks  (voiced by  Michael Keaton ) is an obnoxious green  GM G platform (RWD) , most likely a  Buick Regal , that was popular in the 1980s. He has spent his entire career coming in behind Strip ""The King"" Weathers, and is bitter about this fact. His number is 86 (86 stands for eighty-sixed, a reference of firing someone, it also means 1986, which is his model year and also the year  Pixar  was established). Determined to do whatever it takes to win, he will often ram other cars in order to cause a wreck. He hates Lightning McQueen; however, he does tend to copy him. He uses the nickname Thunder which McQueen created saying ""Thunder always comes after Lightning"". Chick and McQueen share the same dream of being the new face of Dinoco. On the final lap of the tie-breaker race, Chick Hicks becomes so determined not to come in behind The King again that he rams The King off the track, sending The King tumbling for some miles in a large wreck. He expects a huge ovation after McQueen deliberately lets him win the Piston Cup, but is booed off the stage instead, denied the opportunity to represent Dinoco, and forced to make a quick getaway with his trophy. In many ways, he represents what Lightning McQueen could have become.     [ edit ]   Radiator Springs populace     [ edit ]   Mater          a custom  real life version  of mater.       Mater  (voiced by  Larry the Cable Guy ) was inspired by a  1951   International Harvester [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  tow truck but bears more of a resemblance to a 1955-57  Chevrolet  or  GMC ; the actual inspiration may be the 1955-56 version since the hood which Mater recovers at the end of the film after a twenty-year absence lacks the ""gunsights"" of the 1957 model. Mater runs ""Tow Mater Towing and Salvage."" Along with the movie, he also stars in an animated short,  Mater and the Ghostlight , and acts as an announcer in the  Cars  video game. He speaks with a thick Southern accent with a bit of hillbilly  twang , and often misspells words or uses incorrect syntax. Mater is also the (self-proclaimed) world champion backwards driver. He attributes his skill to his rear-view mirrors and his own philosophy: ""Don't need to know where I'm going, just need to know where I've been."" In the movie, Mater befriends and supports Lightning throughout his adventure in Radiator Springs. In the end, McQueen gives Mater an opportunity to fly in a Dinoco helicopter like he always wanted.   His color was originally  baby blue , as shown in a flashback; however, over the years, he has rusted into a patchwork light brown/orange color, with some of the blue still showing through. He is missing his hood and his left headlight. In the credits he managed to fish his hood (which has more of its original color on it than the rest of Mater does) from a cliff up in Tailfin Pass, but then sneezed, causing it to fall back down the cliff. His license plate number is  A113 ; the passenger locomotive which nearly crashes into McQueen before his initial entry into Radiator Springs bears the same number on its identification plates. His final personality was based on his voice actor, Larry the Cable Guy, and he uses many of Larry's catchphrases, including ""Git-R-Done"" during the final race sequence and ""I don't care who you are; that's funny right there"" during the  tractor tipping  scene, among others.   Real life replicas of Mater and Lightning are shown at  Disney's California Adventure  at  Disneyland Resort  in  Anaheim, CA  and  Disney's Hollywood Studios  of  Walt Disney World  in  Lake Buena Vista, FL . In addition unofficial replicas have been created by fans of the movie. [ 5 ]   The original vehicle on which Mater's appearance was based [ 6 ]  currently sits at the ""Four Women on the Route"" diner and souvenir store in  Galena, KS . [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Sally Carrera          Sally Carrera       Sally Carrera  (voiced by  Bonnie Hunt ) is a  royal blue  2002  Porsche 911 Carrera . Her California license plate number is 301PCE. She also appears in the  Cars  video game , in which she is a playable character. Sally,  Lightning McQueen 's love interest and later girlfriend, is the snazzy town attorney of  Radiator Springs . She came to the town several years before, when, in her own words, ""I never felt... happy. One day I just drove and drove, and finally broke down right here. Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in... well, they all did. And I never left."" Sally then fell in love with the town, and the land around it, and settled down in the town. Sally runs the Cozy Cone Motel. Later, she and Lightning reopened the Wheel Well Hotel. She calls McQueen ""Stickers,"" first as a way to tease him (because of his fake headlights), and later as a friendly nickname. In the UK cars magazine  Top Gear , Sally was included in the magazine's list of the 10 sexiest cars in the World [ citation needed ] .     [ edit ]   Doc Hudson   Doc Hudson  (voiced by  Paul Newman ); also known as  ""Dr. Hudson""  or simply  ""Doc"" . His license plate reads 51HHMD (a reference to his year and track number(51) model (Hudson Hornet) and profession (medical doctor)). Doc was once known as the  Fabulous Hudson Hornet  (#51), one of the most famous racecars to have ever lived; he won three Piston Cups, and still holds the record for most wins in a single season (27, a reference to real-life Hornets winning 27  NASCAR  races in 1952). All that changed for the famous Hornet when a terrible crash on the track at the qualifying race in 1954 saw him put out for the season. Upon his return, he was received with a complete absence of fanfare and told that he was a has-been who had been passed up for the next rookie in line. He kept a newspaper article on the career-ending crash as a reminder never to return to the life that nearly killed him.   Jaded by the racing scene, he left that world, apparently taking out time to study medicine. The famous #51 disappeared into obscurity, leaving many wondering where he had gone. He instead opted for a simple  navy blue  paint job and the life of a  physician  in the tiny town of  Radiator Springs , the ""shining  Gemstone "" of the Mother Road -  Route 66 . He runs Doc's Clinic as a ""doctor of  internal combustion "". As times changed and the town got bypassed in favor of  Interstate 40 , Doc stayed on, even when the population had dwindled to a meager dozen or so residents. He is respected, well-loved, and serves not only as the town's physician, but as its judge as well. However, nobody in the town had any idea of his past as a racer; he was just an ordinary  Hudson Hornet  to them.   Upon meeting the young hotshot  Lightning McQueen , Doc saw far too much of his past in the rookie. After McQueen finished fixing the road he damaged and decided to stay for a while, Doc was unable to bear having him around any longer and called the news and press to immediately take him away to the Piston Cup, declaring that it is best for everyone. But seeing how disheartened everyone was by his unplanned departure, Doc realized that McQueen had become more important to them than he thought. He took back his old #51 colors to become McQueen's pit crew chief, bringing nearly the entire town to the Piston Cup to support Lightning as his pit crew. By the end of the film, Doc opts to keep his racing colors, and becomes a trainer as well as crew chief to the young McQueen. Just like McQueen, Doc learned some lessons: friendship, promises, how greed affects others, and that secrets can't be kept forever.   The car is based on the real-life  Fabulous Hudson Hornet  in NASCAR competition driven by  Herb Thomas  and  Marshall Teague .     [ edit ]   Sheriff   Sheriff  (voiced by  Michael Wallis ) is a 1949  Mercury Club Coupe   police car , bearing Carburetor County license plate  001 . Sheriff is painted in the classic law enforcement black and white, with a single red light dome, two  sirens , and  curb feelers . Sheriff was the first resident of  Radiator Springs  to appear in the film and also the first to meet  Lightning McQueen  during a police chase when McQueen was speeding through the town, trying to find  Mack . He later befriends Lightning McQueen, even offering him a police escort to California, and joins his pit crew for the championship race.     [ edit ]   Luigi   Luigi  (voiced by  Tony Shalhoub ) is a 1959  Fiat 500  ragtop. He is a  Scuderia Ferrari  fan, and has followed racing his entire life. His license plate reads 445-108, which is the latitude and longitude for the main  Ferrari  factory in  Modena ,  Italy .  [ 8 ]  Luigi owns a tire shop, Casa Della Tires, which is known for its ""Leaning Tower of Tires,"" a tower of several tires shaped like the  Leaning Tower of Pisa . His assistant is an Italian  forklift truck  named  Guido . Inside his shop are many framed pictures of  World Sportscar Championship   endurance racing  Ferraris from various points in history. At first, Luigi and Guido do not respect  Lightning McQueen  when he comes to  Radiator Springs , because he is not a Ferrari (""Luigi follow only the Ferraris""), but later on they learn to show courtesy to McQueen, fitting him with whitewalls. In the end, McQueen directs a group of Italian sports cars comprised of a Ferrari (voiced by  Michael Schumacher ) and two  Maseratis  to his shop, having recommended it. His car model is also a pun on Fiat's sponsorship for Ferrari at Formula One.   For the Italian version of the film, Luigi was voiced by comedian Marco Della Noce; one of Della Noce's most popular characters was ""Oriano Ferrari"", a parody character meant to represent the leader of Ferrari's pit stop crew. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Guido   Guido  (voiced by  Guido Quaroni ) is a  forklift , who works at Luigi's Casa Della Tires, and is Luigi's best friend. The only language Guido can speak and understand fluently is  Italian , though he appears to understand  English , and even speaks a few phrases, including ""Pit stop"" but pronounced ""Peet Stop!"". His dream is to perform a  pit stop  for a real racecar. Near the end of the movie, as Lightning's pit crew, he performed the fastest pit stop in Piston Cup history, changing all four tires in four seconds.   In order to preserve the ""language barrier"" gags between Guido and the other characters in the Italian dub, his lines (and the other cars' lines in Italian) have been rendered with the  Emiliano-Romagnolo  accent spoken in the town of  Modena , Italy, home of the  Ferrari  car manufacturer and racing team.  Alex Zanardi , an Italian race driver who is a native of Bologna, the largest city in the Emilia-Romagna region (and thus presumably familiar with that dialect), voiced Guido for the Italian version. Coincidentally, or as a pun by the authors, the name ""Guido"" is a perfect  homonym  for the Italian inflected verb meaning ""I drive"".     [ edit ]   Ramone   Ramone  (voiced by  Cheech Marin ) is a 1959  Chevrolet Impala   lowrider  who owns the Ramone's Paint and Body Art store, where he paints himself and other cars, including  Lightning McQueen  later in the film. His license plate reads ""L0WNSL0"", which is a reference to his catchphrase, ""low and slow"". He is married to  Flo , whose restaurant is next door to his store. Ramone is usually depicted purple with a yellow and orange flame job, but throughout the film he changes his paint job every morning to keep his skills sharp, owing to a lack of customers. This situation changes after Radiator Springs becomes vibrant again.   In a deleted scene that told the story of how Ramone and Flo fell in love, the only customer Ramone has refused to paint was his future wife Flo. When she asked him, ""Whassamatta, you too good to paint me?"" he promptly and smoothly replies, ""No way, you too good for me to paint"", and saying that he couldn't paint a classic like Flo, which made her heart melt. The story took place in Radiator Springs of 1974.     [ edit ]   Flo   Flo  (voiced by  Jenifer Lewis ) is the owner of  Radiator Springs  only gas diner, ""Flo's V-8  Cafe "" and is married to  Ramone , the town's body artist. Her license plate reads ""SHOGRL"", the same as the license plates applied to many  Motorama  show cars, and an obvious pun on the term "" showgirl "". A shot of Flo's rear end during the cruising scene shows a secondary plate above her license plate which reads ""Motorama 1957."" According to a deleted scene, she is indeed a Motorama showcar and came to  Radiator Springs  during a national tour. She appears to be inspired by three early- to mid-fifties show cars: the  1951 Buick LeSabre  (front-end lines, the basic hood shape, lights mounted near the corners, and front-quarter trim), the 1951 Buick XP-300 (side trim), and the 1956/57 Chrysler Dart (cockpit, deck lid, and tailfins). [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Fillmore   Fillmore  (voiced by  George Carlin ) is a  Volkswagen Type 2  microbus of late 1950s/early 1960s vintage as evidenced by his pointed front turn signals and small rear window. Fillmore's license plate reads ""51237"", which is a reference to  May 12 ,  1937 , the birthdate of George Carlin. It is also the ZIP Code of  George, Iowa . He is a stereotypical  hippie , with his license plate positioned to resemble a  soul patch . He owns an  organic fuel  shop (Filmore's Organic Fuel) which features several flavors, and believes gasoline companies are lying to the public. In the morning, when next-door neighbor Sarge plays  Reveille  and raises the  Flag of the United States , Fillmore interrupts Sarge's bugle  reveille  with  Jimi Hendrix 's rendition of "" The Star-Spangled Banner ."" This is much to Sarge's irritation, as he shouts at Fillmore:     Sarge : ""Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?!""   Fillmore : ""Respect the classics man, it's Hendrix.""     Despite this, he is friends with Sarge, and the two can be seen chatting throughout the film.   He has a sticker on his rear that says ""I brake for Jackalopes"". The  jackalope  is a mythical creature which features in the theatrical short "" Boundin' "" shown with  The Incredibles .     [ edit ]   Sarge          Sarge       Sarge  (voiced by  Paul Dooley ) is a  Willys   Jeep . A veteran with a military green paint job and a slightly stylized  Sergeant Major  (E-9) insignia on his sides, he appears to be a  World War II  era  Willys MB . His license plate reads ""41WW2"", which indicates the date the Willys MB entered the service of the U.S. Army (1941 World War II). He runs a surplus store, named "" Sarge's Surplus Hut "", next door to Fillmore. Near the end of the film, it is revealed he later opens an Army Camp to train SUVs and 4x4s in rugged and dirt terrain, including Murphy and Frank ""Pinky"" Pinkerton.     [ edit ]   Lizzie   Lizzie  (voiced by  Katherine Helmond ), a 1923  Ford Model T  coupe, is the widow of Radiator Springs' founder, Stanley, and the elderly owner of a roadside souvenir and accessory shop (Radiator Springs Curios). Her license plate, ""MT23"", is a reference to her model and year. Her name is derived from  Tin Lizzie , one of the Model T's popular nicknames. She appears to have gone somewhat  senile , and has a crush on  Lightning McQueen .     [ edit ]   Red   Red  (voiced by  Joe Ranft ) sometimes called  Big Red , is a mid-1960s  closed-cab pumper  bearing Carburetor County license plate ""002."" He is shy and emotional, often bursting into tears and/or hiding whenever he is upset. He spends most of his time  gardening  and washing things, such as the statue of Stanley next to his  fire station . It was stated by Mater that Red hated McQueen for accidentally killing his flowers, but it is clear that Red had forgiven McQueen and warmed up to him, especially since he burst into tears and fled when he thought McQueen left without saying goodbye (which he didn't, but was, unfortunately, forced to do later). Joe Ranft died in a car accident in 2005, shortly before the movie was released. Red is absent in the video game.     [ edit ]   Stanley   Stanley  is Lizzie's late husband and was the founder of Radiator Springs. Stanley was probably a  Stanley Steamer , a steam-driven automobile. A statue of Stanley stands outside the town hall, and although it was broken off its pedestal and dragged through the streets on a cable by Lightning McQueen, it was fortunately not damaged, and another mishap placed the statue right back where it was. Although  dead , Stanley continues to exert an influence on the town, particularly over Lizzie, who often talks to his statue in memory of him.     [ edit ]   Frank   Frank  is a generic orange  combine harvester  that resembles a bull, and the guardian of the tractors. After  Lightning McQueen 's first encounter with Frank during a night of tractor tipping with Mater, Lightning has a nightmare that he, The King, and  Chick Hicks  (the last of whom does not even survive in the nightmare) are beaten by Frank in the tie-breaker race after beginning to feel that he is being distracted by his time in Radiator Springs. He is last seen with the tractors at the drive-in theatre scenes. He is also seen in the short  Mater and the Ghostlight  when Mater races past him, waking him up.     [ edit ]   Announcers     [ edit ]   Darrell Cartrip   Darrell Cartrip  is an announcer at the Piston Cup races. He is a 1977  Chevrolet Monte Carlo , and a former Piston Cup Racer. His name is a play on  Darrell Waltrip , who provides the character's voice. Cartrip utters, ""Boogity boogity boogity!"" as the tiebreaker race starts; the real-life Waltrip is also known to use the phrase at the start of every  NASCAR  race. Cartrip appears in the  Cars  video game as the sole announcer; he is also a playable character in the Piston Cup VS. and Arcade mode. On his side it says, ""Boogity boogity boogity"" and on the back of him it says, ""DWstore.com"". These do not appear in the video game. The car is based on a real-life 1977 Monte Carlo Waltrip drove with DiGard Racing, although it does not have the actual paint scheme (which is owned by Pepsico, the successor to the team's sponsor at the time). The most famous of those cars was the infamous ""Bertha,"" which is at the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in Dallas, Teaxes     [ edit ]   Bob Cutlass   Bob Cutlass  is an announcer at the Piston Cup races and friend of Darrell Cartrip. He is voiced by  Bob Costas , the renowned  NBC  sportscaster and journalist and his name, like Darrell Cartrip's, is a play on that of his voice actor. Although the character's name is a reference to the  Oldsmobile Cutlass , Cutlass is actually shown to be an  Oldsmobile Aurora .     [ edit ]   Other vehicles     [ edit ]   Mia and Tia   Mia , (voiced by  Lindsey Collins ), and  Tia , (voiced by  Elissa Knight ), are identical twin 1990-1997  Mazda Miata  sisters who are  Lightning McQueen 's self-proclaimed biggest fans. They are, however, quite fickle; after McQueen's disappearance, the twins suddenly become ardent fans of  Chick Hicks . By the end of the movie, they are McQueen's fans once more, turning against Hicks after he deliberately caused  Strip ""The King"" Weathers  to crash in the tie-breaker race. Mia and Tia eventually moved to Radiator Springs and work as waitresses at Flo's V8 Cafe. In a deleted scene on the  Cars  DVD, the twins were waitresses at a truck stop at which McQueen stopped.   When they first meet Lightning, Mia and Tia flash their headlights at him, similar to groupies pulling up their shirts to  flash  celebrities.     [ edit ]   Van and Minny   Van  (voiced by  Richard Kind ) and  Minny  (voiced by  Edie McClurg ) are husband and wife. They are lost and pass through Radiator Springs while trying to find their way back to Interstate 40. Van refuses to ask directions, claiming not to need them due to having a  GPS , and both of them are equipped with  car alarms , which they arm after their encounter with Lightning McQueen when he begs them to call for help. After the end of the credits, we find out that Van and Minny have ended up somewhere lost in the desert, having never asked for directions, and Van has almost been driven to  insanity . Their names combined is a pun on "" minivan "". Van appears to be a 2003  Ford Windstar  and Minny is a 1995  Dodge Caravan .     [ edit ]   Delinquent Road Hazards   The  Delinquent Road Hazards  are a group of three import cars and an American muscle car, based on a 1994  Mitsubishi Eclipse , 2000  Nissan Silvia , 2004  Scion xB  (Boost, Wingo, and DJ respectively) and a 1970  Plymouth Barracuda  muscle car (Snot Rod) that cause trouble on the roads. The four of them cause Mack to run off the road, dumping the sleeping McQueen out of his trailer. During the credits, they are apprehended by Sheriff and sentenced to community service (patching up the road).     [ edit ]   Kori Turbowitz   Kori Turbowitz  (voiced by San Francisco Bay Area DJ  Sarah Clark ) is a 1997  Ford Puma ; a news reporter who shows up in the movie three times.

He resembles a 1999  Maybach 57 , He remarks ""I don't know what's harder to find;  Lightning McQueen  or a crew chief who'll work with him!""     [ edit ]   Albert Hinkey   Albert Hinkey  (voiced by Douglas ""Mater"" Keever [ 11 ] ) is an  RV  that proclaims that he is Lightning's biggest fan. He is seen in the background of races. He has another friend that is a fan of Lightning also that is voiced by Larry Benton.     [ edit ]   Fred   Fred  (voiced by  Andrew Stanton ) Fred is a starstruck, very rusty old car. Everybody knows his name, because his license plate says ""FRED."" When McQueen says his name, he shouts, ""He knows my name! He knows my name"" and, in his excitement, his front bumper falls off. Later, when he is unable to gain access to the tie-breaker race and Mario Andretti (who would be waved through the gate on sight as a celebrity) likewise reads his license plate, Fred says, ""Mario Andretti knows my name! You gotta let me in now!"" He was seen again in the end credits spinning around in a circle with rust falling out from under him. When he stopped, his front bumper fell off again.     [ edit ]   TJ Hummer   TJ Hummer  is a vain  Hummer H1  that Sarge teaches in his boot camp during the end of the movie. He refuses to go off road, but Sarge forces him to do so.     [ edit ]   Elvis   Elvis  (voiced by  Sheryl Crow ) is a camper van that acts like  Elvis Presley . His only line is, ""Uh!"" (which is part of the song ""Real Gone"", also by Sheryl Crow) and he is seen in the first part of the movie and briefly on the stadium of the tie-breaker race. He has the Elvis trademark coif and his bodywork is painted like a sparkling suit.     [ edit ]   Sven ""The Governator""   Sven ""The Governator""  (based on and voiced by  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) is a Hummer. His only line is ""Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!"" The name and vehicle refers to Schwarzenegger's job as California governor and the fact that he was one of the first Hummer H1 owners.     [ edit ]   Michael Schumacher   Michael Schumacher  is a 2006 Ferrari F430 sports car voiced by Schumacher himself. He appears at Luigi's shop at the end of the movie after being told by Lightning McQueen that ""this is the best place in the world to buy tires"", and asks to order a few sets of tires for himself and a pair of Maserati Quattroportes who accompany him. After Luigi faints from the excitement of having ""a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in his store"", Schumacher speaks to Guido in Italian, and Guido subsequently faints. The phrase he speaks is in Italian, ""I hope that your friend is okay, I hear that you're the best.""     [ edit ]   Jerry Recycled Batteries   Jerry  (voiced by Joe Ranft) is a 1979  Peterbilt  352 that Lightning McQueen mistook for Mack. He has the words ""Recycled Batteries"" on his side.     [ edit ]   Bessie   Bessie  is a tarmac laying machine that is used to fix roads. When  Lightning McQueen  accidentally destroyed the road with the statue of Stanley, the residents of  Radiator Springs  sentenced him to fix the road with her. She was later seen at the end of the movie when the Delinquent Road Hazards had to fix the road with her as punishment for speeding. Sometimes Bessie boils over and splats tar onto the car(s) pulling her. Bessie is the only vehicle that can't move by itself in the film.

His only line is ""Oh yeah, Whoo!"" He flies above the racetrack and tapes overhead footage of the race with his video camera. The title is also a reference to Buzz Lightyear from  Toy Story . His name, Al Oft, is a reference to ""aloft"" meaning in flight.     [ edit ]   Other racecars     [ edit ]   Dale Earnhardt Jr. #8   Dale Earnhardt Jr. #8 , is a Piston Cup racecar. He is voiced by  Dale Earnhardt Jr. , and closely resembles Dale's #8  NASCAR  car, with the exception that the  Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)  stickers are replaced by  Dale Earnhardt Inc.  stickers to avoid advertising beer in the film. He is a 2003  Chevrolet Monte Carlo  stock car. Junior was first seen in the race at the beginning of the film where he was approching the track and is later seen in the pits. He was seen again during the ""McQueen's Missing"" scene saying that he hoped that Lightning was OK, then at the tie-breaker Junior is seen wishing  The King  good luck in his last race. Junior was last seen at the Radiator Springs racing museum with The King and his wife Lynda.     [ edit ]   Mario Andretti #11   Mario Andretti  voices his eponymous character, who is a former racecar that believes every day is a great day for racing. He is based on the 1967  Ford Fairlane  that the real Andretti drove to Victory in the 1967 Daytona 500.

It was sanctioned by  USAC  from 1971-1979, and by  CART  from 1980-1989. Following the 1989 event, the track was deemed too rough and unsuitable for Indycars, and was permanently removed from the schedule.

The 1981 race was notworthy as it was the final Indycar race other than the Indianapolis 500 to be sanctioned by USAC. A rag-tag field comprised of Indycars and converted dirt-track cars ran a two-class race. Rain halted the race shortly after the halfway point, and ended the race early.   The race moved from June to August starting in 1982. The move was made because the track added a second NASCAR Winston Cup Series race to their schedule, and it was placed in the June date.

(Compilation)                                               Crash Video Web Sites                Metacafe.com   Crashes    Metacafe   has a gigantic collection of videos so it only makes sense theyd have more   than a fair share of crash videos. This link will take you to a huge list featuring   every single video on Metacafe that has a crash tag on it. While there are   some mislabeled videos occasionally appearing on the list (including one a   baby whistling for some odd reason) there are enough videos of car, skateboard,   bike and other vehicle crashes here to keep you morbidly fascinated for days.   The Car Crash Blog    This blog is dedicated to crash videos and nothing else.   Contrary to their title they occasionally feature airplane and helicopter crash,   but the focus is on car crashes. The majority of the content here features   race car crashes of various kinds, from Formula 1 to drag racing. There are   a couple fatal crashes listed, but they are flagged so you know ahead of time.      Progressive Insurance Crashes    Holy crap, Progressive is the best car insurance   company of all time! Geico may save you hundreds of dollars but they dont   have slow-motion crash test footage of Mercedes Benz and countless other cars!   This might be the only car insurance site you visit for entertainment purposes.      Stake-Tube   Wipeouts    Skate-Tube.com is like YouTube but for punk emo kids with   baggy jeans. While a variety of videos are uploaded to the site, including   professional-style skate videos of slickly pulled off tricks; the best part   of their site is their large selection of skaters wiping out something painful.   Videos of dudes suddenly developing a third elbow are not for the squeamish.      Top Speed    Top Speed is a decent blog that is regularly updated with the latest   news and views from the car world. But if you dont care about all that crap   and just want to see fiberglass and steel get torn apart just click on this   link and go straight to their impressive collection of crash videos.      Car Insurance Videos    Lets hope these people have a good insurance company.   That grammatically incorrect statement is the introduction to this packed site   that grabs crash footage from around the internet (mostly Youtube and Metacafe)   for you to gawk at in awe. No keywords, no search options, just one long list   of crash videos. Simple, yet elegant.   Ohio State Patrol    Its guilty-pleasure entertainment supplied by the Ohio State   Government! While not all the videos here are of heinous car wrecks, they are   all immensely entertaining. See drunks stumble, idiots swerve into pulled over   vehicles and much more at this video site hosted by the Ohio State Highway   Patrol.      Law Enforcement Vids    This site claims to be Proudly Devoted to the Men and   Women of Law Enforcement, but the first clip on their homepage today is of   a security guard violently (and illegally) attacking a skater punk. So while   their claims of honoring the valiant efforts of law enforcement are as dubious   as a middle-aged man handing out candy from his van, the videos are wholly   entertaining nonetheless.
