Win Cash Prizes in Online Poker Tournaments The bankroll tournament is a National League of Poker favorite. The prizes offered by bankroll tournaments are cash. The value of the cash prize offered will vary by tournament, but typical values for daily bankroll tournaments are $5, $10, $25 and $50. These tournaments start daily on the half hour. If you are interested in larger bankroll tournaments, keep your eyes open for our special bankroll promotions.  In 2006, we gave out $250,000 in prizes! The third type of online poker tournament that you can enter is the qualifying tournament. These tournaments are used to qualify players for great prizes and larger tournaments. Some of the daily qualifying tournaments include the hat qualifier, keychain qualifier, table qualifier and Rayban qualifier.

clueweb09-en0006-14-04998	     Casino100.Net - Casino euro online casino                                                 Casino Euro  is an online casino which uses software from Net Entertainment, a Swedish-based software developer that is traded on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The site has a good credibility and reputation. Unfortunately, US citizens are not allowed to play on the site except perhaps in free games, but this is no real loss. The site provides a thoroughly enjoyable gaming experience even without the real money bets.                     Layouts, Games and Plays          One of the nice things about  Casino Euro  is its o downloadfeature your actual choice is between playing for real (in which case, registration and an initial deposit is required) or for practice, in which case a single click brings you to the free-games lobby.         The o downloadfeature is fast and quick to load using a broadband connection brings you to the game lobby in the blink of an eye. Selecting a game is just as easy, although the download takes a few seconds. Some players, using a dialup connection, still report quick and easy uploads of games.         Casino Euro  layout is clean and very subdued ool colorspredominate especially at card table games. However even the slots and video poker games show the same uncluttered and clean layouts which is a refreshing change from many online casinos whose idea of games border on the garish and gaudy.         In a way,  Casino Euro  appears to take on the ambience of European (or ld World casinos subdued, elegant and refined. The games move quickly and payouts are excellent whether on the card or table games (blackjack or roulette) or even on the slots and video poker games.         The downside is that there are only a few available slot and video poker games. Although the regular games are available (Deuces Wild, Jacks or Better and so on), the choice remains limited when compared to others.                 Bonuses, Promotions and Cashouts           Casino Euro  offers a signup bonus of up to 111 Euros actually 50 percent of your initial deposit amount. Note that  Casino Euro  games are all in Euros; somewhat confusing if youe not used to the exchange rate. After the first month, subsequent deposits will be matched up to 30 percent of your deposit in other words, a 100 Euro deposit gives you 130 Euros to play with.         Casino Euro  also offers urprisebonuses to random players on an infrequent basis, as well as offering bonuses (under specific terms and conditions) for players who refer a friend to the site. There are also monthly promotional activities that can earn further bonus points.         Deposit options are rather limited, though. Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard and Diners, Neteller and Moneybookers are your options. Withdrawals or cashouts are instantaneous although the actual processing time varies with the payment method employed.

clueweb09-enwp02-22-11709	"                     Texas hold 'em          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Texas hold'em poker )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the popular poker variant.  For the Xbox Live Arcade game, see  Texas Hold 'em (video game) .          Texas hold 'em involves community cards available to all players (pictured here on the left).       Texas hold 'em  (also  hold'em ,  holdem ) is the most popular  poker  game in the casinos and poker card rooms across North America and Europe, as well as  online . According to  Doyle Brunson  and  Johnny Moss , it was originally considered a variation of seven card stud, and was called ""Texas hold 'em seven card stud"" back in the 1920's. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  Hold 'em is a  community card  game where each player may use any combination of the five community cards and the player's own two  hole cards  to make a poker hand, in contrast to  poker variants  like  stud  or  draw  where each player holds a separate individual hand.   After slow but steady gains in popularity throughout the 20th century, hold 'em's popularity surged in the 2000s due to exposure on television, on the Internet and in popular literature. During this time hold 'em replaced  7 card stud  as the most common game in U.S. casinos, almost totally eclipsing the once popular game. [ 3 ]  The  no-limit betting  form is used in the widely televised main event of the  World Series of Poker  (WSOP) and the  World Poker Tour  (WPT).   Because each player starts with only two cards and the remaining cards are shared, it is an excellent game for  strategic analysis  (including  mathematical analysis ). Hold 'em's simplicity and popularity have inspired a wide variety of strategy books which provide recommendations for proper play. Most of these books recommend a strategy that involves playing relatively few hands but betting and raising often with the hands one plays. [ 4 ]           Contents       1   Objective   2   History   3   The hold 'em explosion     3.1   Television and film   3.2   Literature   3.3   Online poker       4   Rules     4.1   Betting structures   4.2   Play of the hand   4.3   The showdown       5   Examples     5.1   Sample showdown   5.2   Sample hand   5.3   Kickers and ties       6   Strategy     6.1   Starting hands   6.2   Strategic Differences in Betting Structures     6.2.1   Cash games   6.2.2   Tournaments           7   Similar games   8   References               [ edit ]   Objective   In Texas hold 'em, like all  variants of poker , individuals compete for an amount of money contributed by the players themselves (called the  pot ). Because the cards are dealt randomly and outside the control of the players, each player attempts to control the amount of money in the pot based on the hand the player holds.   The game is divided into a series of hands or deals; at the conclusion of each hand, the pot is typically awarded to one player (an exception in which the pot is divided between more than one player is discussed below). A hand may end at  the showdown , in which case the remaining players compare their hands and the highest hand is awarded the pot; that highest hand is usually held by only one player, but can be held by more in the case of a  tie . The other possibility for the conclusion of a hand is when all but one player have  folded  and have thereby abandoned any claim to the pot, in which case the pot is awarded to the player who has not folded.   The objective of winning players is not winning every  individual  hand, but rather making mathematically correct decisions regarding when and how much to bet, raise, call or fold. By making such decisions, winning poker players maximize long-term winnings by maximizing their  expected utility  on each round of betting. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Johnny Moss, Chill Wills, Amarillo Slim, Jack Binion, and Puggy Pearson outside of Binion's Horseshoe in 1974       Although little is known about the invention of Texas hold 'em, the  Texas State Legislature  officially recognizes  Robstown, Texas  as the game's birthplace, dating the game to the early 1900s. [ 6 ]   After its invention and spread throughout  Texas , hold 'em was introduced to  Las Vegas  in 1967 by a group of Texan gamblers and card players, including  Crandell Addington ,  Doyle Brunson , and  Amarillo Slim . [ 7 ]  Addington said the first time he saw the game was in 1959. ""They didn't call it Texas hold 'em at the time, they just called it hold 'em... I thought then that if it were to catch on, it would become the game.  Draw poker , you only bet twice; hold 'em, you bet four times. That meant you could play strategically. This was more of a thinking man's game."" [ 8 ]   For several years the  Golden Nugget Casino  in  Downtown Las Vegas  was the only casino in Las Vegas to offer the game. At that time, the Golden Nugget's poker room was ""truly a ' sawdust  joint,' with... oiled sawdust covering the floors."" [ 9 ]  Because of its location and decor, this poker room did not receive many rich drop-in clients, and as a result, professional players sought a more prominent location. In 1969, the Las Vegas professionals were invited to play Texas hold 'em at the entrance of the now-demolished  Dunes Casino  on the  Las Vegas Strip . This prominent location, and the relative inexperience of poker players with Texas hold 'em, resulted in a very remunerative game for professional players. [ 9 ]   After a disappointing attempt to establish a ""Gambling Fraternity Convention"", Tom Moore added the first ever poker tournament to the Second Annual Gambling Fraternity Convention held in 1969. This tournament featured several games including Texas hold 'em. In 1970  Benny  and  Jack Binion  acquired the rights to this convention, renamed it the  World Series of Poker , and moved it to their casino  Binion's Horseshoe Casino  in Las Vegas. After its first year, a journalist, Tom Thackrey, suggested that the main event of this tournament should be  no-limit  Texas hold 'em. The Binions agreed and ever since no-limit Texas hold 'em has been played as the main event. [ 9 ]  Interest in the Main Event continued to grow steadily over the next two decades. After receiving only 8 entrants in 1972, the numbers grew to over 100 entrants in 1982, and over 200 in 1991. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   During this time, Doyle Brunson's revolutionary poker strategy guide,  Super/System  was first published. [ 13 ]  Despite being self-published and priced at $100 in 1978, the book revolutionized the way poker was played. It was one of the first books to discuss Texas hold 'em, and is today cited as one of the most important books on this game. [ 14 ]  A few years later,  Al Alvarez  published a book detailing an early  World Series of Poker  event. [ 15 ]  The first book of its kind, it described the world of professional poker players and the  World Series of Poker . It is credited with beginning the genre of poker literature and with bringing Texas hold 'em (and poker generally), for the first time, to a wider audience. [ 16 ]   Interest in hold 'em outside of  Nevada  began to grow in the 1980s as well. Although  California  had legal card rooms offering  draw poker , Texas hold 'em was prohibited under a statute which made illegal the now unknown game ""stud-horse"". However in 1988, Texas hold 'em was declared legally distinct from ""stud-horse"" in  Tibbetts v. Van De Kamp , 271 Cal. Rptr. 792 (1990). Almost immediately card rooms across the state offered Texas hold 'em. [ 17 ]  (It is often presumed that this decision ruled that hold 'em was a skill game, [ 18 ]  but the distinction between skill and chance has never entered into California jurisprudence regarding poker. [ 19 ] ) After a trip to Las Vegas, bookmakers  Terry Rogers  and  Liam Flood  introduced the game to European card players in the early 1980s. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   The hold 'em explosion   In the first decade of the 21st century, Texas hold 'em experienced a surge in popularity worldwide. [ 3 ]  Many observers attribute this growth to the synergy of five factors: the invention of  online poker , the game's appearance in film and on television, the  2004-05 NHL lockout , [ 21 ]  the appearance of television commercials advertising online cardrooms, and the  2003 World Series of Poker  championship victory by online qualifier  Chris Moneymaker . [ 22 ]           Joe Hachem , winner of  2005 World Series of Poker  main event         [ edit ]   Television and film       Main article:  Poker on television       Prior to poker becoming widely televised, the movie  Rounders  (1998), starring  Matt Damon  and  Edward Norton , gave moviegoers a romantic view of the game as a way of life. Texas hold 'em was the main game played during the movie and the no-limit variety was described, following  Doyle Brunson , as the ""Cadillac of Poker"". A clip of the classic showdown between  Johnny Chan  and  Erik Seidel  from the  1988 World Series of Poker  was also incorporated into the film. [ 23 ]  More recently, a high-stakes Texas Hold'em game was central to the plot of the 2006  James Bond  film  Casino Royale , in place of  baccarat  which was originally the casino game central to the story in the novel from which the film was based.   Hold 'em tournaments had been televised since the late 1970's, but they did not become popular until 1999, when hidden  lipstick cameras  were first used to show players' private hole cards on the  Late Night Poker  TV show in the United Kingdom. [ 24 ]  Hold 'em exploded in popularity as a spectator sport in the United States and Canada in early 2003, when the World Poker Tour adopted the  lipstick cameras  idea. A few months later,  ESPN 's coverage of the  2003 World Series of Poker  featured the unexpected victory of  Internet  player  Chris Moneymaker , an amateur player who gained admission to the tournament by winning a series of online tournaments. Moneymaker's victory initiated a sudden surge of interest in the World Series, based on the  egalitarian  idea that anyone  even a rank novice  can become a world champion. [ 25 ]   In 2003, there were 839 entrants in the WSOP Main Event, [ 26 ]  and triple that number in 2004. [ 27 ]  The crowning of the  2004 WSOP  champion,  Greg ""Fossilman"" Raymer , a  patent attorney  from Connecticut, further fueled the popularity of the event among amateur (and particularly internet) players. [ 28 ]  In the  2005 Main Event , an unprecedented 5,619 entrants vied for a first prize of $7,500,000. The winner,  Joe Hachem  of Australia, was a semi-professional player. [ 29 ]  This growth continued in 2006, with 8,773 entrants and a first place prize of $12,000,000 (won by  Jamie Gold ). [ 30 ]   Beyond the World Series, other television shows  including the long running  World Poker Tour   are credited with increasing the popularity of Texas hold 'em. [ 31 ]  In addition to its presence on network and general audience cable television, [ 32 ]  poker has now become a regular part of sports networks' programming in the United States. [ 33 ]     [ edit ]   Literature   Twenty years after the publication of Alvarez's groundbreaking book,  James McManus  published a semi-autobiographical book,  Positively Fifth Street  (2003), which simultaneously describes the trial surrounding the murder of  Ted Binion  and McManus' own entry into the  2000 World Series of Poker . [ 34 ]  McManus, a poker amateur, finished 5th in the No-Limit Texas Hold 'em main event, winning over $200,000. [ 35 ]  In the book McManus discusses events surrounding the World Series, the trial of Sandy Murphy and Rick Tabish, poker strategy, and some history of poker and the world series.   Michael Craig 's 2005 book  The Professor, the Banker, and the Suicide King  details a series of high stakes Texas hold 'em one-on-one games between  Texas   banker   Andy Beal  and a rotating group of poker professionals. As of 2006, these games were the highest stakes ever played, reaching $100,000$200,000  fixed limit . [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Online poker          Poker revenues from  Party Gaming  (2002-2006). The drop off in 2006 is due to the  UIGEA .           Main article:  Online poker       The ability to play cheaply and anonymously online has been credited as a cause of the increase in popularity of Texas hold 'em. [ 25 ]  Online poker sites both allow people to try out games and also provide an avenue for entry into large tournaments (like the World Series of Poker) via smaller tournaments known as satellites. Both the 2003 and 2004 winners of the World Series qualified by playing in these tournaments. [ 37 ] [ 38 ]   Although online poker grew from its inception in 1998 until 2003, Moneymaker's win and the appearance of televisions advertisements in 2003 contributed to a tripling of industry revenues in 2004. [ 39 ] [ 40 ]     [ edit ]   Rules     The descriptions below assume a familiarity with the general  game play of poker , and with  poker hands . For a general introduction to these topics, see  poker ,  poker hands ,  poker probability , and  poker jargon .       [ edit ]   Betting structures     See the article on  betting  for a detailed explanation of betting in these variations of hold 'em.            A standard hold 'em game showing the position of the blinds relative to the dealer button       Hold 'em is normally played using small and big  blind bets   forced bets by two players.  Antes  (forced contributions by all players) may be used in addition to blinds, particularly in later stages of  tournament play . A  dealer button  is used to represent the player in the dealer position; the dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand, changing the position of the dealer and blinds. The  small blind  is posted by the player to the left of the dealer and is usually equal to half of the big blind. The  big blind , posted by the player to the left of the small blind, is equal to the minimum bet. In  tournament poker , the blind/ante structure periodically increases as the tournament progresses. (In some cases, the small blind is some other fraction of a small bet, e.g. $10 is a common small blind when the big blind is $15. The  double-blind  structure described above is a commonly used and more recent adoption.)   When only two players remain, special 'head-to-head' or 'heads up' rules are enforced and the blinds are posted differently. In this case, the person with the dealer button posts the small blind, while his/her opponent places the big blind. The dealer acts first before the  flop . After the flop, the dealer acts last and remains this way for the remainder of the hand.   The three most common variations of hold 'em are  limit  hold 'em,  no-limit  hold 'em and  pot-limit  hold 'em. Limit hold 'em has historically been the most popular form of hold 'em found in casino  live action  games in the United States. [ 3 ]  In limit hold 'em, bets and raises during the first two rounds of betting (pre-flop and  flop ) must be equal to the big blind; this amount is called the  small bet . In the next two rounds of betting (turn and river), bets and raises must be equal to twice the big blind; this amount is called the  big bet . No-limit hold 'em is the form most commonly found in televised tournament poker and is the game played in the main event of the  World Series of Poker . In no-limit hold 'em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum raise up to all of the chips the player has at the table (called an  all-in  bet). The minimum raise is equal to the big blind. If someone wishes to re-raise, they must raise at least the amount of the previous raise. For example, if the big blind is $2 and there is a bet of $6 to a total of $8, a raise must be at least $6 more for a total of $14. If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise, the initial raiser can not re-raise again. This only matters of course if there was a call before the re-raise. In pot-limit hold 'em, the maximum raise is the current size of the pot (including the amount needed to call).   Most casinos that offer hold 'em also allow the player to the left of the big blind to post an optional  live straddle , usually double the amount of the big blind, which then acts as the big blind. No-limit games may also allow multiple re-straddles, in any amount that would be a legal raise. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Play of the hand          Each player is dealt two private cards in hold 'em. They are dealt first.       Play begins with each player being dealt two  cards  face down, with the player in the small blind receiving the first card and the player in the button seat receiving the last card dealt. (Like most poker games, the deck is a standard 52-card deck, no jokers.) These cards are the player's  hole  or  pocket cards . These are the only cards each player will receive individually, and they will only (possibly) be revealed at the  showdown , making Texas hold 'em a  closed  poker game.   The hand begins with a ""pre-flop"" betting round, beginning with the player to the left of the big blind (or the player to the left of the dealer, if no blinds are used) and continuing  clockwise . A round of betting continues until every player has folded, put in all of their chips, or matched the amount put in by all other active players. See  betting  for a detailed account. Note that the blinds are considered ""live"" in the pre-flop betting round, meaning that they contribute to the amount that the blind player must contribute, and that, if all players call around to the player in the big blind position, that player may either check or raise.   After the pre-flop betting round, assuming there remain at least two players taking part in the hand, the dealer deals a  flop , three face-up  community cards . The flop is followed by a second betting round. This and all subsequent betting rounds begin with the player to the dealer's left and continue clockwise.   After the flop betting round ends, a single community card (called the  turn  or fourth street) is dealt, followed by a third betting round. A final single community card (called the  river  or fifth street) is then dealt, followed by a fourth betting round and the showdown, if necessary.   In all casinos, the dealer will  burn  a card before the flop, turn, and river. Because of this burn, players who are betting cannot see the back of the next community card to come, which might be marked. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   The showdown   If a player bets and all other players fold, then the remaining player is awarded the pot and is not required to show his hole cards. If two or more players remain after the final betting round, a  showdown  occurs. On the showdown, each player plays the best five-card  poker hand  he can make from the seven cards comprising his two hole cards and the five community cards. A player may use both of his own two hole cards, only one, or none at all, to form his final five-card hand. If the five community cards form the player's best hand, then the player is said to be  playing the board  and can only hope to  split  the pot, since each other player can also use the same five cards to construct the same hand. [ 13 ]   If the best hand is shared by more than one player, then the pot is split equally among them, with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in clockwise order. It is common for players to have closely-valued, but not identically ranked hands. Nevertheless, one must be careful in determining the best hand; if the hand involves fewer than five cards, (such as  two pair  or  three of a kind ), then  kickers  are used to settle ties (see the second example below). Note that the card's  numerical  rank is of sole importance;  suit values  are irrelevant in Hold'em.     [ edit ]   Examples     [ edit ]   Sample showdown   Here's a sample showdown:       Board           Bob              Carol              Ted              Alice                Each player plays the best 5-card hand they can make with the seven cards available. They have       Bob     Three fours, with ace, king kicker       Carol     Ace-high flush       Ted     Full house, kings full of fours       Alice     8-high straight       In this case, Ted's full house is the best hand, with Carol in 2nd, Alice in 3rd and Bob last.     [ edit ]   Sample hand          The blinds for this example hand       Here is a sample game involving four players. The players' individual hands will not be revealed until the showdown, to give a better sense of what happens during play:   Compulsory bets:  Alice is the dealer. Bob, to Alice's left, posts a small blind of $1, and Carol posts a big blind of $2.   Pre-flop:  Alice deals two hole cards face down to each player, beginning with Bob and ending with herself. Ted must act first because he is the first player after the big blind. He cannot  check , since the $2 big blind plays as a bet, so he folds. Alice  calls  the $2. Bob adds an additional $1 to his $1 small blind to call the $2 total. Carol's blind is ""live"" (see  blind ), so she has the  option  to raise here, but she checks instead, ending the first betting round. The pot now contains $6, $2 from each of three players.   Flop:  Alice now burns a card and deals the flop of three face-up community cards,  9   K   3 . On this round, as on all subsequent rounds, the player on the dealer's left begins the betting. In this case it is Bob, who checks. Carol opens for $2, Ted has already folded and Alice raises another $2 (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol and $2 to raise), making the total bet now facing Bob $4. He calls (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol's initial bet and $2 to match Alice's raise). Carol calls as well, putting in her $2. The pot now contains $18, $6 from the last round and $12 from three players this round.   Turn:  Alice now burns another card and deals the turn card face up. It is the  5 . Bob checks, Carol checks, and Alice checks; the turn has been  checked around . The pot still contains $18.   River:  Alice burns another card and deals the final river card, the  9 , making the final board  9   K   3   5   9 . Bob bets $4, Carol calls, and Alice folds (Alice's holding was  A   7 ; she was hoping the river card would be a club to make her hand a  flush ).   Showdown:  Bob shows his hand of  Q   9 , so the best five-card hand he can make is  9   9   9   K   Q , for  three  nines, with a king-queen kicker. Carol shows her cards of  K   J , making her final hand  K   K   9   9   J  for  two pair , kings and nines, with a jack kicker. Bob wins the showdown and the $26 pot.     [ edit ]   Kickers and ties   Because of the presence of community cards in Texas hold 'em, different players' hands can often run very close in value. As a result, it is not uncommon for  kickers  to be used to determine the winning hand and also for two hands (or maybe more) to tie. A kicker is a card which is part of the five-card poker hand, but is not used in determining a hand's  rank . For instance, in the hand  A - A - A - K - Q , the king and queen are kickers.   The following situation illustrates the importance of breaking ties with kickers and card ranks, as well as the use of the five-card rule. After the turn, the board and players' hole cards are as follows.       Board (after the turn)           Bob         Carol           At the moment, Bob is in the lead with a hand of  Q   Q   8   8   K , making two pair, queens and eights, with a king kicker. This beats Carol's hand of  Q   Q   8   8   10  by virtue of his king kicker.   Suppose the final card were the  A , making the final board  8   Q   8   4   A . Bob and Carol still each have two pair (Queens and eights), but both of them are now entitled to play the final ace as their fifth card, making their hands both two pair, queens and eights, with an ace kicker. Bob's king no longer plays, because the ace on the board plays as the fifth card in both hands, and a hand is only composed of the best five cards. They therefore tie and split the pot. However, had the last card been King or lower (except a Queen which would make a full house, or a Ten which would give Carol a higher pair), Bob's King would have stayed in game and he would have won.     [ edit ]   Strategy           Doyle Brunson  is credited with bringing poker strategy to a wider audience         See  Poker strategy  for a more detailed discussion of general poker strategy     Most poker authors recommend a tight- aggressive  approach to playing Texas hold 'em. This strategy involves playing relatively few hands (tight), but betting and raising often with those that one does play (aggressive). [ 4 ]  Although this strategy is often recommended, some professional players successfully employ other strategies as well. [ 4 ]   Almost all authors agree that where a player sits in the order of play (known as  position ) is an important element of Texas hold 'em strategy, particularly in no-limit hold'em. [ 5 ]  Players who act later have more information than players who act earlier. As a result, players typically play fewer hands from early positions than later positions.   Because of the game's level of complexity, it has received some attention from academics. One attempt to develop a quantitative model of a Texas hold'em tournament as an isolated complex system has had some success, [ 41 ]  although the full consequences for optimal strategies remain to be explored. In addition, groups at the  University of Alberta  and  Carnegie Mellon University  are developing poker playing programs utilizing techniques in  game theory  and  artificial intelligence . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]     [ edit ]   Starting hands       Main article:  Texas hold 'em starting hands              A pair of  aces  is statistically the best hand to be dealt in Texas Hold'em Poker       Because there are only two cards dealt to each player, it is easy to characterize all of the starting hands. There are (52  51)  2 = 1,326 distinct possible  combinations  of two cards from a standard 52-card deck. Because  no suit is more powerful than another , many of these can be equated for the analysis of starting-hand strategy. For example, although  J   J  and  J   J  are distinct combinations of cards, they are of equal value as starting hands.   Viewed this way there are only 169 different hole-card combinations. Thirteen of those hands would be pairs, from 2 through ace. There are 78 ways to have two cards of different rank (12 possible hands containing an ace, 11 possible hands containing a king and no ace, 10 possible hands containing a queen and no ace or king, etc.). Hole cards can both be used in a  flush  if they are suited, but pairs are never suited, so there would be 13 possible pairs, 78 possible suited non-pairs, and 78 possible unsuited non-pairs, for a total of 169 possible hands. [ 44 ]  Suited starting cards are usually considered stronger than unsuited hands, although the magnitude of this strength in different games is debated. [ 45 ]   Because of this limited number of starting hands, most strategy guides involve a detailed discussion of each of these 169 starting hands. This separates hold 'em from other poker games where the number of starting card combinations forces strategy guides to group hands into broad categories. Another result of this small number is the proliferation of colloquial names for individual hands. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Strategic Differences in Betting Structures   Texas Hold'em is commonly played both as a  ""cash"" or ""ring"" game  and as a  tournament game . Strategy for these different forms varies widely.     [ edit ]   Cash games       Main article:  Ring game       Prior to the invention of  poker tournaments , all poker games were played with real money where players bet actual currency (or chips which represented currency). Games which feature wagering actual money on individual hands are still very common and are referred to as ""cash games"" or ""ring games"".   The  no-limit  and  fixed-limit  cash game versions of hold 'em are strategically very different. Doyle Brunson claims that ""the games are so different that there are  not  many players who rank with the best in both types of hold 'em. Many no-limit players have difficulty  gearing down  for limit, while limit players often lack the courage and 'feel' necessary to excel at no-limit."" [ 13 ]  Because the size of bets is restricted in limit games, the ability to  bluff  is somewhat curtailed. Since one is not (usually) risking all of one's chips in limit poker, players are sometimes advised to take more chances. [ 13 ]   Lower stakes games also exhibit different properties than higher stakes games. Small stakes games often involve more players in each hand and can vary from extremely passive (little raising and betting) to extremely aggressive (many raises). The difference of small stakes games have resulted in several books dedicated to only those games. [ 47 ]     [ edit ]   Tournaments       Main article:  Poker tournament       Texas hold 'em is often associated with poker tournaments largely because it is played as the main event in many of the famous tournaments, including the  World Series of Poker 's Main Event, and is the most common tournament overall. [ 48 ]  Traditionally, a poker tournament is played with  chips  that represent a player's stake in the tournament. Standard play allows all entrants to ""buy-in"" a fixed amount and all players begin with an equal value of chips. Play proceeds until one player has accumulated all the chips in play. The money pool is redistributed to the players in relation to the place they finished in the tournament. Only a small percentage of the players receive any money, with the majority receiving nothing. ""The percentages are not standardized, but common rules of thumb call for one table"" (usually nine players) ""to get paid for each 100 entrants,"" according to poker expert Andrew N. S. Glazer, in his book,  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Poker . [ 49 ]  As a result the strategy in poker tournaments can be very different from a cash game.   Proper strategy in tournaments can vary widely depending on the amount of chips one has, the stage of the tournament, the amount of chips others have, and the playing styles of one's opponents. [ 4 ]  Although some authors still recommend a tight playing style, others recommend looser play (playing more hands) in tournaments than one would otherwise play in cash games. In tournaments the blinds and antes increase regularly, and can become much larger near the end of the tournament. This can force players to play hands that they would not normally play when the blinds were small, which can warrant both more loose and more aggressive play. [ 50 ]     [ edit ]   Similar games   There are several other poker variants which resemble Texas hold 'em. Hold 'em is a member of a class of poker games known as  community card games , where some cards are available for use by all the players. There are several other games that use five community cards in addition to some private cards and are thus similar to Texas hold 'em.  Royal hold 'em  has the same structure as Texas hold 'em, but the deck contains only Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, and Tens. [ 51 ]   Pineapple  and  Omaha hold 'em  both vary the number of cards an individual receives before the flop (along with the rules regarding how they may be used to form a hand), but are dealt identically afterward. [ 52 ] [ 53 ]  Alternatively, in  Double-board hold'em  all players receive the same number of private cards, but there are two sets of community cards. The winner is either selected for each individual board with each receiving half of the pot, or the best overall hand takes the entire pot, depending on the rules agreed upon by the players. [ 54 ]   Manila  is a hold'em variant popular in Australia. In Manila, players receive two private cards from a reduced deck (containing no cards lower than 7). A five card board is dealt, unlike Texas hold 'em, one card at a time; there is a betting round after each card. Manila has several variations of its own, similar to the variants listed above.

For the Xbox Live Arcade game, see  Texas Hold 'em (video game) .          Texas hold 'em involves community cards available to all players (pictured here on the left).       Texas hold 'em  (also  hold'em ,  holdem ) is the most popular  poker  game in the casinos and poker card rooms across North America and Europe, as well as  online . According to  Doyle Brunson  and  Johnny Moss , it was originally considered a variation of seven card stud, and was called ""Texas hold 'em seven card stud"" back in the 1920's. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  Hold 'em is a  community card  game where each player may use any combination of the five community cards and the player's own two  hole cards  to make a poker hand, in contrast to  poker variants  like  stud  or  draw  where each player holds a separate individual hand.   After slow but steady gains in popularity throughout the 20th century, hold 'em's popularity surged in the 2000s due to exposure on television, on the Internet and in popular literature. During this time hold 'em replaced  7 card stud  as the most common game in U.S. casinos, almost totally eclipsing the once popular game. [ 3 ]  The  no-limit betting  form is used in the widely televised main event of the  World Series of Poker  (WSOP) and the  World Poker Tour  (WPT).   Because each player starts with only two cards and the remaining cards are shared, it is an excellent game for  strategic analysis  (including  mathematical analysis ). Hold 'em's simplicity and popularity have inspired a wide variety of strategy books which provide recommendations for proper play. Most of these books recommend a strategy that involves playing relatively few hands but betting and raising often with the hands one plays.

Because the cards are dealt randomly and outside the control of the players, each player attempts to control the amount of money in the pot based on the hand the player holds.   The game is divided into a series of hands or deals; at the conclusion of each hand, the pot is typically awarded to one player (an exception in which the pot is divided between more than one player is discussed below). A hand may end at  the showdown , in which case the remaining players compare their hands and the highest hand is awarded the pot; that highest hand is usually held by only one player, but can be held by more in the case of a  tie . The other possibility for the conclusion of a hand is when all but one player have  folded  and have thereby abandoned any claim to the pot, in which case the pot is awarded to the player who has not folded.   The objective of winning players is not winning every  individual  hand, but rather making mathematically correct decisions regarding when and how much to bet, raise, call or fold. By making such decisions, winning poker players maximize long-term winnings by maximizing their  expected utility  on each round of betting.

[ 6 ]   After its invention and spread throughout  Texas , hold 'em was introduced to  Las Vegas  in 1967 by a group of Texan gamblers and card players, including  Crandell Addington ,  Doyle Brunson , and  Amarillo Slim . [ 7 ]  Addington said the first time he saw the game was in 1959. ""They didn't call it Texas hold 'em at the time, they just called it hold 'em... I thought then that if it were to catch on, it would become the game.  Draw poker , you only bet twice; hold 'em, you bet four times. That meant you could play strategically. This was more of a thinking man's game."" [ 8 ]   For several years the  Golden Nugget Casino  in  Downtown Las Vegas  was the only casino in Las Vegas to offer the game. At that time, the Golden Nugget's poker room was ""truly a ' sawdust  joint,' with... oiled sawdust covering the floors."" [ 9 ]  Because of its location and decor, this poker room did not receive many rich drop-in clients, and as a result, professional players sought a more prominent location. In 1969, the Las Vegas professionals were invited to play Texas hold 'em at the entrance of the now-demolished  Dunes Casino  on the  Las Vegas Strip . This prominent location, and the relative inexperience of poker players with Texas hold 'em, resulted in a very remunerative game for professional players. [ 9 ]   After a disappointing attempt to establish a ""Gambling Fraternity Convention"", Tom Moore added the first ever poker tournament to the Second Annual Gambling Fraternity Convention held in 1969. This tournament featured several games including Texas hold 'em. In 1970  Benny  and  Jack Binion  acquired the rights to this convention, renamed it the  World Series of Poker , and moved it to their casino  Binion's Horseshoe Casino  in Las Vegas. After its first year, a journalist, Tom Thackrey, suggested that the main event of this tournament should be  no-limit  Texas hold 'em. The Binions agreed and ever since no-limit Texas hold 'em has been played as the main event. [ 9 ]  Interest in the Main Event continued to grow steadily over the next two decades. After receiving only 8 entrants in 1972, the numbers grew to over 100 entrants in 1982, and over 200 in 1991. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   During this time, Doyle Brunson's revolutionary poker strategy guide,  Super/System  was first published. [ 13 ]  Despite being self-published and priced at $100 in 1978, the book revolutionized the way poker was played. It was one of the first books to discuss Texas hold 'em, and is today cited as one of the most important books on this game. [ 14 ]  A few years later,  Al Alvarez  published a book detailing an early  World Series of Poker  event. [ 15 ]  The first book of its kind, it described the world of professional poker players and the  World Series of Poker . It is credited with beginning the genre of poker literature and with bringing Texas hold 'em (and poker generally), for the first time, to a wider audience. [ 16 ]   Interest in hold 'em outside of  Nevada  began to grow in the 1980s as well. Although  California  had legal card rooms offering  draw poker , Texas hold 'em was prohibited under a statute which made illegal the now unknown game ""stud-horse"". However in 1988, Texas hold 'em was declared legally distinct from ""stud-horse"" in  Tibbetts v. Van De Kamp , 271 Cal. Rptr. 792 (1990). Almost immediately card rooms across the state offered Texas hold 'em. [ 17 ]  (It is often presumed that this decision ruled that hold 'em was a skill game, [ 18 ]  but the distinction between skill and chance has never entered into California jurisprudence regarding poker. [ 19 ] ) After a trip to Las Vegas, bookmakers  Terry Rogers  and  Liam Flood  introduced the game to European card players in the early 1980s. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   The hold 'em explosion   In the first decade of the 21st century, Texas hold 'em experienced a surge in popularity worldwide. [ 3 ]  Many observers attribute this growth to the synergy of five factors: the invention of  online poker , the game's appearance in film and on television, the  2004-05 NHL lockout , [ 21 ]  the appearance of television commercials advertising online cardrooms, and the  2003 World Series of Poker  championship victory by online qualifier  Chris Moneymaker . [ 22 ]           Joe Hachem , winner of  2005 World Series of Poker  main event         [ edit ]   Television and film       Main article:  Poker on television       Prior to poker becoming widely televised, the movie  Rounders  (1998), starring  Matt Damon  and  Edward Norton , gave moviegoers a romantic view of the game as a way of life. Texas hold 'em was the main game played during the movie and the no-limit variety was described, following  Doyle Brunson , as the ""Cadillac of Poker"". A clip of the classic showdown between  Johnny Chan  and  Erik Seidel  from the  1988 World Series of Poker  was also incorporated into the film. [ 23 ]  More recently, a high-stakes Texas Hold'em game was central to the plot of the 2006  James Bond  film  Casino Royale , in place of  baccarat  which was originally the casino game central to the story in the novel from which the film was based.   Hold 'em tournaments had been televised since the late 1970's, but they did not become popular until 1999, when hidden  lipstick cameras  were first used to show players' private hole cards on the  Late Night Poker  TV show in the United Kingdom. [ 24 ]  Hold 'em exploded in popularity as a spectator sport in the United States and Canada in early 2003, when the World Poker Tour adopted the  lipstick cameras  idea. A few months later,  ESPN 's coverage of the  2003 World Series of Poker  featured the unexpected victory of  Internet  player  Chris Moneymaker , an amateur player who gained admission to the tournament by winning a series of online tournaments. Moneymaker's victory initiated a sudden surge of interest in the World Series, based on the  egalitarian  idea that anyone  even a rank novice  can become a world champion. [ 25 ]   In 2003, there were 839 entrants in the WSOP Main Event, [ 26 ]  and triple that number in 2004. [ 27 ]  The crowning of the  2004 WSOP  champion,  Greg ""Fossilman"" Raymer , a  patent attorney  from Connecticut, further fueled the popularity of the event among amateur (and particularly internet) players. [ 28 ]  In the  2005 Main Event , an unprecedented 5,619 entrants vied for a first prize of $7,500,000. The winner,  Joe Hachem  of Australia, was a semi-professional player. [ 29 ]  This growth continued in 2006, with 8,773 entrants and a first place prize of $12,000,000 (won by  Jamie Gold ). [ 30 ]   Beyond the World Series, other television shows  including the long running  World Poker Tour   are credited with increasing the popularity of Texas hold 'em. [ 31 ]  In addition to its presence on network and general audience cable television, [ 32 ]  poker has now become a regular part of sports networks' programming in the United States. [ 33 ]     [ edit ]   Literature   Twenty years after the publication of Alvarez's groundbreaking book,  James McManus  published a semi-autobiographical book,  Positively Fifth Street  (2003), which simultaneously describes the trial surrounding the murder of  Ted Binion  and McManus' own entry into the  2000 World Series of Poker . [ 34 ]  McManus, a poker amateur, finished 5th in the No-Limit Texas Hold 'em main event, winning over $200,000. [ 35 ]  In the book McManus discusses events surrounding the World Series, the trial of Sandy Murphy and Rick Tabish, poker strategy, and some history of poker and the world series.   Michael Craig 's 2005 book  The Professor, the Banker, and the Suicide King  details a series of high stakes Texas hold 'em one-on-one games between  Texas   banker   Andy Beal  and a rotating group of poker professionals. As of 2006, these games were the highest stakes ever played, reaching $100,000$200,000  fixed limit . [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Online poker          Poker revenues from  Party Gaming  (2002-2006). The drop off in 2006 is due to the  UIGEA .           Main article:  Online poker       The ability to play cheaply and anonymously online has been credited as a cause of the increase in popularity of Texas hold 'em. [ 25 ]  Online poker sites both allow people to try out games and also provide an avenue for entry into large tournaments (like the World Series of Poker) via smaller tournaments known as satellites. Both the 2003 and 2004 winners of the World Series qualified by playing in these tournaments. [ 37 ] [ 38 ]   Although online poker grew from its inception in 1998 until 2003, Moneymaker's win and the appearance of televisions advertisements in 2003 contributed to a tripling of industry revenues in 2004. [ 39 ] [ 40 ]     [ edit ]   Rules     The descriptions below assume a familiarity with the general  game play of poker , and with  poker hands . For a general introduction to these topics, see  poker ,  poker hands ,  poker probability , and  poker jargon .       [ edit ]   Betting structures     See the article on  betting  for a detailed explanation of betting in these variations of hold 'em.            A standard hold 'em game showing the position of the blinds relative to the dealer button       Hold 'em is normally played using small and big  blind bets   forced bets by two players.  Antes  (forced contributions by all players) may be used in addition to blinds, particularly in later stages of  tournament play . A  dealer button  is used to represent the player in the dealer position; the dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand, changing the position of the dealer and blinds. The  small blind  is posted by the player to the left of the dealer and is usually equal to half of the big blind. The  big blind , posted by the player to the left of the small blind, is equal to the minimum bet. In  tournament poker , the blind/ante structure periodically increases as the tournament progresses. (In some cases, the small blind is some other fraction of a small bet, e.g. $10 is a common small blind when the big blind is $15. The  double-blind  structure described above is a commonly used and more recent adoption.)   When only two players remain, special 'head-to-head' or 'heads up' rules are enforced and the blinds are posted differently. In this case, the person with the dealer button posts the small blind, while his/her opponent places the big blind. The dealer acts first before the  flop . After the flop, the dealer acts last and remains this way for the remainder of the hand.   The three most common variations of hold 'em are  limit  hold 'em,  no-limit  hold 'em and  pot-limit  hold 'em. Limit hold 'em has historically been the most popular form of hold 'em found in casino  live action  games in the United States. [ 3 ]  In limit hold 'em, bets and raises during the first two rounds of betting (pre-flop and  flop ) must be equal to the big blind; this amount is called the  small bet . In the next two rounds of betting (turn and river), bets and raises must be equal to twice the big blind; this amount is called the  big bet . No-limit hold 'em is the form most commonly found in televised tournament poker and is the game played in the main event of the  World Series of Poker . In no-limit hold 'em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum raise up to all of the chips the player has at the table (called an  all-in  bet). The minimum raise is equal to the big blind. If someone wishes to re-raise, they must raise at least the amount of the previous raise. For example, if the big blind is $2 and there is a bet of $6 to a total of $8, a raise must be at least $6 more for a total of $14. If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise, the initial raiser can not re-raise again. This only matters of course if there was a call before the re-raise. In pot-limit hold 'em, the maximum raise is the current size of the pot (including the amount needed to call).   Most casinos that offer hold 'em also allow the player to the left of the big blind to post an optional  live straddle , usually double the amount of the big blind, which then acts as the big blind. No-limit games may also allow multiple re-straddles, in any amount that would be a legal raise. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Play of the hand          Each player is dealt two private cards in hold 'em. They are dealt first.       Play begins with each player being dealt two  cards  face down, with the player in the small blind receiving the first card and the player in the button seat receiving the last card dealt. (Like most poker games, the deck is a standard 52-card deck, no jokers.) These cards are the player's  hole  or  pocket cards . These are the only cards each player will receive individually, and they will only (possibly) be revealed at the  showdown , making Texas hold 'em a  closed  poker game.   The hand begins with a ""pre-flop"" betting round, beginning with the player to the left of the big blind (or the player to the left of the dealer, if no blinds are used) and continuing  clockwise . A round of betting continues until every player has folded, put in all of their chips, or matched the amount put in by all other active players. See  betting  for a detailed account. Note that the blinds are considered ""live"" in the pre-flop betting round, meaning that they contribute to the amount that the blind player must contribute, and that, if all players call around to the player in the big blind position, that player may either check or raise.   After the pre-flop betting round, assuming there remain at least two players taking part in the hand, the dealer deals a  flop , three face-up  community cards . The flop is followed by a second betting round. This and all subsequent betting rounds begin with the player to the dealer's left and continue clockwise.   After the flop betting round ends, a single community card (called the  turn  or fourth street) is dealt, followed by a third betting round. A final single community card (called the  river  or fifth street) is then dealt, followed by a fourth betting round and the showdown, if necessary.   In all casinos, the dealer will  burn  a card before the flop, turn, and river. Because of this burn, players who are betting cannot see the back of the next community card to come, which might be marked. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   The showdown   If a player bets and all other players fold, then the remaining player is awarded the pot and is not required to show his hole cards. If two or more players remain after the final betting round, a  showdown  occurs. On the showdown, each player plays the best five-card  poker hand  he can make from the seven cards comprising his two hole cards and the five community cards. A player may use both of his own two hole cards, only one, or none at all, to form his final five-card hand. If the five community cards form the player's best hand, then the player is said to be  playing the board  and can only hope to  split  the pot, since each other player can also use the same five cards to construct the same hand. [ 13 ]   If the best hand is shared by more than one player, then the pot is split equally among them, with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in clockwise order. It is common for players to have closely-valued, but not identically ranked hands. Nevertheless, one must be careful in determining the best hand; if the hand involves fewer than five cards, (such as  two pair  or  three of a kind ), then  kickers  are used to settle ties (see the second example below). Note that the card's  numerical  rank is of sole importance;  suit values  are irrelevant in Hold'em.     [ edit ]   Examples     [ edit ]   Sample showdown   Here's a sample showdown:       Board           Bob              Carol              Ted              Alice                Each player plays the best 5-card hand they can make with the seven cards available. They have       Bob     Three fours, with ace, king kicker       Carol     Ace-high flush       Ted     Full house, kings full of fours       Alice     8-high straight       In this case, Ted's full house is the best hand, with Carol in 2nd, Alice in 3rd and Bob last.     [ edit ]   Sample hand          The blinds for this example hand       Here is a sample game involving four players. The players' individual hands will not be revealed until the showdown, to give a better sense of what happens during play:   Compulsory bets:  Alice is the dealer. Bob, to Alice's left, posts a small blind of $1, and Carol posts a big blind of $2.   Pre-flop:  Alice deals two hole cards face down to each player, beginning with Bob and ending with herself. Ted must act first because he is the first player after the big blind. He cannot  check , since the $2 big blind plays as a bet, so he folds. Alice  calls  the $2. Bob adds an additional $1 to his $1 small blind to call the $2 total. Carol's blind is ""live"" (see  blind ), so she has the  option  to raise here, but she checks instead, ending the first betting round. The pot now contains $6, $2 from each of three players.   Flop:  Alice now burns a card and deals the flop of three face-up community cards,  9   K   3 . On this round, as on all subsequent rounds, the player on the dealer's left begins the betting. In this case it is Bob, who checks. Carol opens for $2, Ted has already folded and Alice raises another $2 (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol and $2 to raise), making the total bet now facing Bob $4. He calls (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol's initial bet and $2 to match Alice's raise). Carol calls as well, putting in her $2. The pot now contains $18, $6 from the last round and $12 from three players this round.   Turn:  Alice now burns another card and deals the turn card face up. It is the  5 . Bob checks, Carol checks, and Alice checks; the turn has been  checked around . The pot still contains $18.   River:  Alice burns another card and deals the final river card, the  9 , making the final board  9   K   3   5   9 . Bob bets $4, Carol calls, and Alice folds (Alice's holding was  A   7 ; she was hoping the river card would be a club to make her hand a  flush ).   Showdown:  Bob shows his hand of  Q   9 , so the best five-card hand he can make is  9   9   9   K   Q , for  three  nines, with a king-queen kicker. Carol shows her cards of  K   J , making her final hand  K   K   9   9   J  for  two pair , kings and nines, with a jack kicker. Bob wins the showdown and the $26 pot.     [ edit ]   Kickers and ties   Because of the presence of community cards in Texas hold 'em, different players' hands can often run very close in value. As a result, it is not uncommon for  kickers  to be used to determine the winning hand and also for two hands (or maybe more) to tie. A kicker is a card which is part of the five-card poker hand, but is not used in determining a hand's  rank . For instance, in the hand  A - A - A - K - Q , the king and queen are kickers.   The following situation illustrates the importance of breaking ties with kickers and card ranks, as well as the use of the five-card rule. After the turn, the board and players' hole cards are as follows.       Board (after the turn)           Bob         Carol           At the moment, Bob is in the lead with a hand of  Q   Q   8   8   K , making two pair, queens and eights, with a king kicker. This beats Carol's hand of  Q   Q   8   8   10  by virtue of his king kicker.   Suppose the final card were the  A , making the final board  8   Q   8   4   A . Bob and Carol still each have two pair (Queens and eights), but both of them are now entitled to play the final ace as their fifth card, making their hands both two pair, queens and eights, with an ace kicker. Bob's king no longer plays, because the ace on the board plays as the fifth card in both hands, and a hand is only composed of the best five cards. They therefore tie and split the pot. However, had the last card been King or lower (except a Queen which would make a full house, or a Ten which would give Carol a higher pair), Bob's King would have stayed in game and he would have won.     [ edit ]   Strategy           Doyle Brunson  is credited with bringing poker strategy to a wider audience         See  Poker strategy  for a more detailed discussion of general poker strategy     Most poker authors recommend a tight- aggressive  approach to playing Texas hold 'em. This strategy involves playing relatively few hands (tight), but betting and raising often with those that one does play (aggressive). [ 4 ]  Although this strategy is often recommended, some professional players successfully employ other strategies as well. [ 4 ]   Almost all authors agree that where a player sits in the order of play (known as  position ) is an important element of Texas hold 'em strategy, particularly in no-limit hold'em. [ 5 ]  Players who act later have more information than players who act earlier. As a result, players typically play fewer hands from early positions than later positions.   Because of the game's level of complexity, it has received some attention from academics. One attempt to develop a quantitative model of a Texas hold'em tournament as an isolated complex system has had some success, [ 41 ]  although the full consequences for optimal strategies remain to be explored. In addition, groups at the  University of Alberta  and  Carnegie Mellon University  are developing poker playing programs utilizing techniques in  game theory  and  artificial intelligence . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]     [ edit ]   Starting hands       Main article:  Texas hold 'em starting hands              A pair of  aces  is statistically the best hand to be dealt in Texas Hold'em Poker       Because there are only two cards dealt to each player, it is easy to characterize all of the starting hands. There are (52  51)  2 = 1,326 distinct possible  combinations  of two cards from a standard 52-card deck. Because  no suit is more powerful than another , many of these can be equated for the analysis of starting-hand strategy. For example, although  J   J  and  J   J  are distinct combinations of cards, they are of equal value as starting hands.   Viewed this way there are only 169 different hole-card combinations. Thirteen of those hands would be pairs, from 2 through ace. There are 78 ways to have two cards of different rank (12 possible hands containing an ace, 11 possible hands containing a king and no ace, 10 possible hands containing a queen and no ace or king, etc.). Hole cards can both be used in a  flush  if they are suited, but pairs are never suited, so there would be 13 possible pairs, 78 possible suited non-pairs, and 78 possible unsuited non-pairs, for a total of 169 possible hands. [ 44 ]  Suited starting cards are usually considered stronger than unsuited hands, although the magnitude of this strength in different games is debated. [ 45 ]   Because of this limited number of starting hands, most strategy guides involve a detailed discussion of each of these 169 starting hands. This separates hold 'em from other poker games where the number of starting card combinations forces strategy guides to group hands into broad categories. Another result of this small number is the proliferation of colloquial names for individual hands. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Strategic Differences in Betting Structures   Texas Hold'em is commonly played both as a  ""cash"" or ""ring"" game  and as a  tournament game . Strategy for these different forms varies widely.     [ edit ]   Cash games       Main article:  Ring game       Prior to the invention of  poker tournaments , all poker games were played with real money where players bet actual currency (or chips which represented currency). Games which feature wagering actual money on individual hands are still very common and are referred to as ""cash games"" or ""ring games"".   The  no-limit  and  fixed-limit  cash game versions of hold 'em are strategically very different. Doyle Brunson claims that ""the games are so different that there are  not  many players who rank with the best in both types of hold 'em. Many no-limit players have difficulty  gearing down  for limit, while limit players often lack the courage and 'feel' necessary to excel at no-limit."" [ 13 ]  Because the size of bets is restricted in limit games, the ability to  bluff  is somewhat curtailed. Since one is not (usually) risking all of one's chips in limit poker, players are sometimes advised to take more chances. [ 13 ]   Lower stakes games also exhibit different properties than higher stakes games. Small stakes games often involve more players in each hand and can vary from extremely passive (little raising and betting) to extremely aggressive (many raises). The difference of small stakes games have resulted in several books dedicated to only those games. [ 47 ]     [ edit ]   Tournaments       Main article:  Poker tournament       Texas hold 'em is often associated with poker tournaments largely because it is played as the main event in many of the famous tournaments, including the  World Series of Poker 's Main Event, and is the most common tournament overall. [ 48 ]  Traditionally, a poker tournament is played with  chips  that represent a player's stake in the tournament. Standard play allows all entrants to ""buy-in"" a fixed amount and all players begin with an equal value of chips. Play proceeds until one player has accumulated all the chips in play. The money pool is redistributed to the players in relation to the place they finished in the tournament. Only a small percentage of the players receive any money, with the majority receiving nothing. ""The percentages are not standardized, but common rules of thumb call for one table"" (usually nine players) ""to get paid for each 100 entrants,"" according to poker expert Andrew N. S. Glazer, in his book,  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Poker . [ 49 ]  As a result the strategy in poker tournaments can be very different from a cash game.   Proper strategy in tournaments can vary widely depending on the amount of chips one has, the stage of the tournament, the amount of chips others have, and the playing styles of one's opponents. [ 4 ]  Although some authors still recommend a tight playing style, others recommend looser play (playing more hands) in tournaments than one would otherwise play in cash games. In tournaments the blinds and antes increase regularly, and can become much larger near the end of the tournament. This can force players to play hands that they would not normally play when the blinds were small, which can warrant both more loose and more aggressive play. [ 50 ]     [ edit ]   Similar games   There are several other poker variants which resemble Texas hold 'em. Hold 'em is a member of a class of poker games known as  community card games , where some cards are available for use by all the players. There are several other games that use five community cards in addition to some private cards and are thus similar to Texas hold 'em.  Royal hold 'em  has the same structure as Texas hold 'em, but the deck contains only Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, and Tens. [ 51 ]   Pineapple  and  Omaha hold 'em  both vary the number of cards an individual receives before the flop (along with the rules regarding how they may be used to form a hand), but are dealt identically afterward. [ 52 ] [ 53 ]  Alternatively, in  Double-board hold'em  all players receive the same number of private cards, but there are two sets of community cards. The winner is either selected for each individual board with each receiving half of the pot, or the best overall hand takes the entire pot, depending on the rules agreed upon by the players. [ 54 ]   Manila  is a hold'em variant popular in Australia. In Manila, players receive two private cards from a reduced deck (containing no cards lower than 7). A five card board is dealt, unlike Texas hold 'em, one card at a time; there is a betting round after each card. Manila has several variations of its own, similar to the variants listed above.

For the PBS network with the same abbreviation, see  Wisconsin Public Television .   The  World Poker Tour (WPT)  is a series of international  poker tournaments  featuring most of the world's professional players. It was started in the United States by attorney/television producer  Steven Lipscomb , who now serves as  CEO  of WPT Enterprises (WPTE), the firm that controls the World Poker Tour.     [ edit ]   Introduction   The World Poker Tour is a collection of  Texas hold 'em   poker tournaments  held internationally, but mainly in the  United States . The television show and the broadcasts of the World Series of Poker have led to a boom in the table game across American homes, in local casino poker rooms and online. The key sponsors of the tour are casinos and online poker sites. The show, which is syndicated internationally, is co-hosted by  World Series of Poker bracelet  winner  Mike Sexton , and actor  Vince Van Patten .  Shana Hiatt  served as the show host and sideline reporter in its first three seasons.  Courtney Friel  took over the host role for the fourth season, and  Sabina Gadecki  for the fifth.  Layla Kayleigh  and  Kimberly Lansing  began serving as hostesses in season six. WPT has announced that poker player and reporter  Amanda Leatherman , who was hired in July 2008 to host ""live updates"" on the WPT website, will be the hostess for season seven.     [ edit ]   Background   The tour had its debut season in the latter part of 2002 and early part of 2003, climaxing with the WPT Championship in April 2003 at the  Bellagio Casino  in  Las Vegas ,  Nevada . The first season aired on the  Travel Channel  on  American   cable television  in the spring of 2003. The show made its network debut on  February 1 ,  2004  on  NBC  with a special ""Battle Of Champions"" tournament, which aired against  CBS  coverage of the  Super Bowl XXXVIII  pre-game show. The Travel Channel aired the first five seasons of the Tour. In April 2007, WPTE announced that the series would move to  GSN  for its sixth season in the spring of 2008  [ 1 ] . The first WPT tournament to air on GSN, the Mirage Poker Showdown, debuted on  March 24 ,  2008 . In July 2008, WPTE announced that the series would move to  Fox Sports Net  for its seventh season.     [ edit ]   Commentary   The show's hosts Mike Sexton and Vince Van Patten give the impression that all of their commentary is recorded live as the tournament happens, and they have occasionally interacted with the players during the game. However, their comments about hole cards are recorded after the tournament takes place because gaming regulations prohibit them from observing a live feed of the ""hole card cameras"" while on the set. Consequently, the broadcast audio is a mix of the live recording, and commentary recorded in post-production.     [ edit ]   Reception   The drawing power of the WPT and most other poker tournaments is that anyone who can pay the ""buy-in"" (an amount ranging from $2,500 to $25,000) or win a ""satellite"" tournament is able to compete against the top professional players.   In 2004, the World Poker Tour created a  Walk of Fame , inducting poker legends  Doyle Brunson  and  Gus Hansen  as well as actor  James Garner .   Now in its sixth season of broadcast, it still remains among the highest rated television programs on cable. It airs Mondays on Game Show Network. The first three seasons of WPT are also available on  NTSC   DVD . (The second season DVD set features audio commentary by several of the players. The third season is only available in a ""Best Of"" format, featuring just half of the episodes.) CITY TV airs the WPT on Sundays at 4pm PST in Canada with a rebroadcast at Midnight (or shortly after depending on the length of their Sunday Night Movie. The series moved to Monday nights since the move to  GSN  in 2008. Beginning with the 2008 season, host Mike Sexton no longer toasts the winner of the Tournament with an ""official beer of the World Poker Tour"" (sponsored in years past by  Anheuser-Busch ). They now provide champagne glasses for their salute.   The seventh season will be shown on  FSN . In accordance with the agreement, one player a week will win a tournament on ClubWPT.com and appear on a televised show.   A series of spin-off tournaments, titled the  Professional Poker Tour , began filming in 2004. Broadcast of the series was delayed, in part because of a dispute with the Travel Channel over rights. In the fall of 2005, WPTE announced that ""a cable channel"" (believed to be  ESPN ) had withdrawn from bidding for the PPT series, and that WPTE was negotiating with the Travel Channel to air the series. On  January 30 ,  2006 , WPTE and the Travel Channel announced that they had dismissed all open lawsuits. The series began regular broadcast  July 5 ,  2006 , but was suspended after one season as WPTE couldn't find a television home for a second season.     [ edit ]   Sherman Act lawsuit   In July 2006, seven poker professionals sued WPTE, alleging violations of the  Sherman Antitrust Act , the California Cartwright Act, and intentional interference with contract (Complaint [ 2 ]  and Response [ 3 ] ). The professionals ( Chris Ferguson ,  Andy Bloch ,  Annie Duke ,  Joe Hachem ,  Phil Gordon ,  Howard Lederer , and  Greg Raymer ) allege that WPTE's standard release forms, required for participation in WPTE events, are anti-competitive and designed to interfere with their contractual obligations to other companies. The anti-competition claim is based on the fact that WPTE's contracts with the casinos that host its tournaments bar those casinos (and other casinos owned by the same parent companies) from hosting non-WPTE poker events. The claim of interference with contract is based on the releases' claim to perpetual rights to the players' likenesses for any use WPTE wishes. The players claim that this would put them in violation of other contracts (such as Ferguson's Activision Games contract or several players' contracts with online poker sites)  [ 4 ] . Hachem and Raymer dropped out of the lawsuit before its eventual settlement.     [ edit ]   Settlement   In April 2008, WPT Enterprises, Inc. settled with the five remaining players of the lawsuit that was brought against them, Chris Ferguson, said about the settlement,  ""We are happy to have come to an agreement that is fair to all players, and to have put in place a new release that clears up ambiguities in how players' images may be used. We are especially happy that this new release will apply to all poker players who wish to participate in WPT tournaments and events."" [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   WPT Ladies   In January 2008, the WPT announced a set of tournaments for women, known as WPT Ladies. [ 6 ]  The first season will have five events, with buy-ins ranging from $300 to $1,500. The final table of the final event will be televised.     [ edit ]   WPT Walk of Fame   The  World Poker Tour  Walk of Fame  is designed to honor those  poker  players who have played the game well at the highest levels as well as those who have promoted the spread of it through film, television, and literature.   In February 2004, the World Poker Tour Walk of Fame inducted its first members at the  Commerce Casino  in a ceremony before top pros and celebrities in town for the World Poker Tour Invitational Poker Tournament. The induction ceremony was staged on the doorstep of Commerce Casino.   No new players have been inducted since 2004. The original inductees were  Doyle Brunson ,  Gus Hansen  and  James Garner .     [ edit ]   Player of the Year   Points are awarded for all Open events as follows:     Winner: 1000 points   Runner-up: 700 points   3rd place: 600 points   4th place: 500 points   5th place: 400 points   6th place: 300 points   7th place (TV bubble): 200 points     This award is given out to one player per season.

Hellmuth, Jr.  (born July 16, 1964) is an  American  professional  poker  player. He is best known for holding a record eleven  World Series of Poker  bracelets, for winning the Main Event of the  1989 World Series of Poker   [ 1 ]  and for his ""poker brat"" personality. He is also a member of the  Poker Hall of Fame .

He held that distinction until 2008, when 22-year-old  Peter Eastgate  became the youngest Main Event champion.   At the  2006 World Series of Poker , he captured his record 10th World Series of Poker bracelet in the $1,000 No Limit Hold'em with rebuys event. [ 3 ]  At the time, this tied him with fellow poker legends  Doyle Brunson  and Johnny Chan. However, unlike Brunson and Chan, all of his bracelets are in  Texas hold'em .   At the  2007 World Series of Poker , Hellmuth won his record-breaking 11th bracelet in the $1,500 No Limit Hold'em Event. [ 4 ]  Hellmuth also holds the records for most WSOP cashes (68) [ 5 ]  and most WSOP final tables (41), recently overtaking  TJ Cloutier .   At the Main Event of the  2008 World Series of Poker  Hellmuth made a deep run finishing in 45th place out of a field of 6,844. He was the last former champion standing at the event when he was knocked out. Hellmuth took home $154,400.   Hellmuth has won $5,859,080 at the WSOP and is ranked 8th on the WSOP All Time Money List.

He has cashed 10 times and made 3 final tables. He finished 4th in the $3,000 No Limit Hold'em WPT Event at the 3rd Annual 49'er Gold Rush Bonanza in 2002 and 3rd in the $10,000 No Limit Hold'em WPT Event at the World Poker Finals at  Foxwoods  in 2003 and at the 2008 WPT L.A. Poker Classic Hellmuth finished in sixth place earning $229,480 in a final table that included both  Phil Ivey  and  Nam Le . He also played in two WPT Invitational Events, the World Poker Tour by The Book in 2004 and the WPT Bad Boys of Poker II in 2006 and finished 3rd both times. [ 8 ]   To date, Hellmuth has won $691,109 in WPT tournaments. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Other tournaments   Hellmuth is the season 3 champion of  Late Night Poker . [ 10 ]   In 2005, Hellmuth won the first  National Heads-Up Poker Championship [ 11 ] . He defeated  Men Nguyen ,  Paul Phillips ,  Huck Seed ,  Lyle Berman  and  Antonio Esfandiari  on the way to the final against  Chris Ferguson  whom he defeated in two out of three games. While trying to repeat in 2006, he lost in the first round to  Chip Reese [ 12 ] . In 2007, Hellmuth did not play due to the PartyPoker.com Premier League Poker, a British tournament in which he took part. He won 4 out of his 6 group matches and eventually finished 3rd in the finals. Hellmuth took part in the 2008 National Heads-Up Poker Championship [ 13 ] , losing in the first round to  Tom Dwan .   He makes regular appearances on episodes of  Poker After Dark , both as a player and as a drop in commentator. Hellmuth won his first Poker After Dark tournament in the first episode of the third season, winning a net $100,000. Hellmuth returned two weeks later and claimed his second Poker After Dark title, winning another net of $100,000. [ 8 ]  He also appeared in the first and fourth seasons of  GSN 's  cash game  show,  High Stakes Poker [ 14 ] .   As of 2009, his total live tournament winnings exceed $10,700,000. [ 8 ]  He is ranked 3rd on the All Time Money List, behind  Jamie Gold , and  Daniel Negreanu .  [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Poker-related activities   Hellmuth has made several instructional poker videos, including his  Ultimate White To Black Belt Course  and  Phil Hellmuth's Million Dollar Poker Secrets.  He has written many articles for Cardplayer magazine and several poker books including  Play Poker like the Pros ,  Bad Beats and Lucky Draws ,  The Greatest Poker Hands ever Played , and  Poker Brat , which contains autobiographical material as well as poker advice. In May 2004 Phil Helmuth partnered with  Oasys Mobile  for the release of  Texas Hold'em by Phil Hellmuth.  At the time it was one of the ten most popular multi-player mobile phone games available. [ 16 ]  In spring 2006, Hellmuth replaced  Phil Gordon  as commentator on Bravo's  Celebrity Poker Showdown . [ 17 ]   Along with  Annie Duke , Hellmuth is a poker coach on Fox Sports Networks  Best Damn Poker Show , which is sponsored by the poker site  Ultimatebet.net .     [ edit ]   Personality and controversy          Phil Hellmuth at the  2006 World Series of Poker .       Hellmuth is known for making disrespectful remarks about his opponents skills, especially after taking  bad beats . [ 18 ]  During the Main Event of the 2005 World Series of Poker he stated ""I can dodge bullets, baby!"" after laying down Ace King to an opponent's pocket Aces on a board of A 4 4 Q rainbow. He later accused an opponent of not even being able to spell poker after the player put all of his money in the pot preflop with King Jack against Hellmuth's Ace King; Hellmuth's opponent hit a  three-outer  to win the pot. [ 19 ]  Other famous quotes include: ""If luck weren't involved, I guess I'd win every [tournament],"" and ""I've revolutionized the way to play Texas hold 'em."" [ 18 ]   On one occasion, Hellmuth so infuriated veteran poker professional  Sam Grizzle  that they got into a fistfight. Hellmuth claims that the fight was a draw and that neither one of them was injured, [ 20 ]  but other accounts report that Grizzle easily won the fight with a single punch. [ 21 ]   In the first week of the show  Poker After Dark  on NBC, after fellow pros  Shawn Sheikhan ,  Steve Zolotow ,  Gus Hansen  and  Huck Seed  refused to stop talking while it was his turn to act on his hand after  Annie Duke  raised him, Hellmuth threatened never to play in these tournaments again. Duke was the only player at the table who remained quiet while the drama played out. Producers of the show came up with a ruling regarding the situation, Hellmuth returned and was eliminated a few hands later by Sheikhan. [ 22 ]   Hellmuth's sponsor,  UltimateBet , arranged for him to arrive at the 2007 WSOP Main Event in an Ultimatebet race car, escorted by 11 Ultimatebet models (one for each of Hellmuth's 11 World Series of Poker bracelets). However, Hellmuth crashed the race car in the  Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino  parking lot when he lost control of the vehicle and hit a concrete light fixture. After the accident, Hellmuth showed up in a limo, met his escorts, and made his grand entrance to the Main Event two hours late. [ 23 ] The accident was briefly, by some sources, thought to be staged, but Hellmuth said it wasn't. [ 24 ]  He later made light of the accident in a television advertisement for Ultimatebet. In 2008, Hellmuth again made a grand entrance into the WSOP Main Event. As part of Ultimatebet's ""UB Army"" promotion, Hellmuth arrived in a convoy dressed in military garb, with eleven stars on his helmet (for the eleven WSOP bracelets he has won).   On day 5 of the 2008 WSOP, Hellmuth folded a hand to Cristian Dragomir. Asked by the table to show his hand, Dragomir revealed that he had called Hellmuth's pre-flop re-raise with  10   4  (a weak hand). Hellmuth proceeded to call Dragomir an ""idiot,"" among other terms. He was eventually issued a warning by the floorperson for continued berating of another player. In addition, he was advised by other players (including close friend  Mike Matusow , who was seated at the same table) that he should stop. Nonetheless, he continued to berate Dragomir, until he was given a one-round penalty. The penalty was to be carried out at the beginning of play the next day. [ 25 ]  However, overnight, Hellmuth had a private meeting with WSOP Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack, after which Pollack overruled the floorperson's decision. [ 26 ]  (Hellmuth eventually finished this tournament in 45th place, while Dragomir finished in 29th.)   On December 20, 2008 Hellmuth was playing $200/$400 heads up limit hold em on  UltimateBet , where he is a spokesman, when an apparent software glitch occurred and the $5599 pot was awarded to Hellmuth, even though he held the worst hand. (His opponent held  K   Q  for Three Kings and Hellmuth held Ten Two for two pair.) This hand became the subject of considerable controversy in the  online forums  due to Hellmuth's later comments about the hand. Immediately after the other player informed him of the error in awarding the pot, Hellmuth simply commented ""U wanna play or what?"" and ""I play U limit, right now."" In addition, when later questioned about the hand, Hellmuth commented that he had experienced such errors a hundred times in his online career, ""maybe 50 the wrong way to them and 50 the wrong way to me."" [ 27 ]  (This contradicted the official statement of Ultimatebet that no other cases of this error had been found. [ 28 ] ) Finally, the  previous cheating scandal at Ultimatebet  led to suspicions about the plausibility of the company's explanation for the computer bug that they claim caused the error. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   Hellmuth was born in  Madison, Wisconsin , and attended the  University of Wisconsin-Madison  for three years before dropping out to play poker full-time. He currently resides in  Palo Alto, California , with his wife Katherine Sanborn and two sons, Phillip and Nicholas. [ 32 ]   Hellmuth's wife played in the Ladies' Event of the  2005 World Series of Poker , where she was eliminated by eventual champion  Jennifer Tilly . Katherine holds a degree in child psychology.

The Bellagio Cup poker tournament series has about seven daily poker tournaments  with buy-ins generally ranging from $2,000 to $5,000.  The main event  Bellagio Cup Championship Poker Tournament is a five day $15,000 buy-in poker  tournament.  The Bellagio Cup poker tournaments are all no limit    Texas  Holdem  poker tournaments.    The Bellagio Cup poker tournament series starts the beginning of July at the  Bellagio just as the  World Series of Poker   is winding down at the  Rio Las Vegas   Casino.  So, the Bellagio Cup is an easy transition for many of the poker  professionals that are already in Las Vegas for the World Series of Poker  tournaments.  To accommodate players coming from the World Series of Poker,  the official ""Day 1"" of the Bellagio Cup Championship Poker Tournament is split  over three consecutive days and the fourth day becomes the official ""Day 2"" of  the Bellagio Cup Championship.  So, stragglers are welcome.    The Bellagio Cup Championship Poker Tournament is a    World Poker Tour  Tournament  and poker tournament players are seeking not only the tournament prize money, but  a $25,000 seat at the World Poker Tour Championship the following April.   The World Poker Tour Championship is also held at the Bellagio.    The Bellagio is the host for some other popular Word Poker Tour tournament  events including the  Bellagio Festa al Lago Poker Tournament   in October, the  Bellagio Five Diamond World Poker Classic   in November and December, and the  Bellagio Five Star World Poker Classic   in April.    The smaller footprint and exclusivity of the Bellagio Cup poker tournaments make  this a fun event to participate in either as a player or a viewer.  The  Bellagio poker room does hold a number of satellite tournaments and Super  Satellite tournaments so even if the Bellagio Cup poker tournament buy-ins may  be steep, there is plenty of opportunity to try one's luck at a satellite poker  tournament.  As a viewer there are some real characters among the poker  pros and most of them are friendly.    The Bellagio Cup poker tournaments typically start at noon but be sure to  confirm dates and times with the Bellagio poker room.  For  more information about the Bellagio Cup, call the Bellagio Poker Room at (702) 693-7290 prior to the  poker tournament.

A  poker tournament  is a  tournament  in which the winners are decided by playing  poker , usually a particular style of poker.   Contrast this to a  ring game , where the game is ongoing with no formal structure to determine a single winner in a certain length of time.           Contents       1   Buy-ins and prizes   2   Betting format   3   Types of poker   4   Tournament venues   5   Major tournaments   6   See also   7   External links               [ edit ]   Buy-ins and prizes   To enter a typical tournament, a player pays a fixed  buy-in  and at the start of play is given a certain quantity of tournament  poker chips . Commercial venues may also charge a separate fee, or withhold a small portion of the buy-in, as the cost of running the event. Tournament chips have only notional value; they have no cash value, and only the tournament chips, not cash, may be used during play. Typically, the amount of each entrant's starting tournament chips is an  integer  multiple of the buy-in. Some tournaments offer the option of a  re-buy  or  buy-back ; this gives players the option of purchasing more chips. In some cases, re-buys are conditional (for example, offered only to players low on or out of chips) but in others they are available to all players (called  add-ons ). When a player has no chips remaining (and has exhausted or declined all re-buy options, if any are available) he or she is eliminated from the tournament.   In most tournaments, the number of players at each table is kept even by moving players, either by switching one player or (as the field shrinks) taking an entire table out of play and distributing its players amongst the remaining tables. A few tournaments, called  shoot-outs , do not do this; instead, the last player (sometimes the last two or more players) at a table moves on to a second or third round, akin to a  single-elimination tournament  found in other games.   The prizes for winning are usually derived from the buy-ins, though outside funds may be entered as well. For example, some invitational tournaments do not have buy-ins and fund their prize pools with  sponsorship  revenue and/or gate receipts from spectators. (These tournaments are referred to as  freerolls .) Play continues, in most tournaments, until all but one player is eliminated, though in some tournament situations, especially informal ones, players have the option of ending by consensus.   Players are ranked in reverse chronological order  the last person in the game earns 1st place, the second-to-last earns 2nd, and so on. This ranking of players by elimination is unique amongst games, and also precludes the possibility of a tie for first place, since one player alone must have all the chips to end the tournament. (Ties are possible for all other places, though they are rare since the sole tiebreaker is the number of chips one has at the start of the hand in which one is eliminated, and hence two people would need to start a hand with the exact same number of chips and both be eliminated on that same hand in order to tie each other.)   Sometimes tournaments end by mutual consensus of the remaining players. For example, in a ten-person, $5 game, there may be two players remaining with $29 and $21, respectively, worth of chips. Rather than risk losing their winning, as one of them would if the game were continued, these two players may be allowed to split the prize proportional to their in-game currency (or however they agree).   Prizes are awarded to the winning players in one of two ways:     Fixed : Each placing corresponds to a certain payoff. For example, a ten-person, $20 buy-in tournament might award $100 to the first-place player, $60 for second-place, $40 for third, and nothing for lower places.       Proportional : Payouts are determined according to a percentage-based scale. The percentages are determined based upon the number of participants and will increase payout positions as participation increases. As a rule, roughly one player in ten will 'cash', or make a high enough place to earn money. These scales are very top-heavy, with the top three players usually winning more than the rest of the paid players combined.     Tournaments can be open or invitational. The  World Series of Poker , whose Main Event (a $10,000 buy-in  no limit   Texas Hold 'Em  tournament) is considered the most prestigious of all poker tournaments, is open.   Multi-table tournaments  involve many players playing simultaneously at dozens or even hundreds of tables.  Satellite tournaments  to high-profile, expensive poker tournaments are the means of entering a major event without posting a significant sum of cash. These have significantly smaller buy-ins, usually on the order of one-tenth to one-fiftieth the main tournament's buy-in, and can be held at various venues across the country and, more recently, on the  Internet . Top players in this event, in lieu of a cash prize, are awarded seats to the main tourney, with the number of places dependent on participation.  Chris Moneymaker , who won the  2003   World Series of Poker  Main Event, was able to afford his seat by winning an Internet tournament with a $39 buy-in.  Greg Raymer ,  2004  World Series of Poker champion, acquired his seat via a $165 Internet tournament.   The opposite of a multi-table tournament is a  single-table tournament,  often abbreviated  STT.  A number of places (typically, nine or ten) are allocated at a single table, and as soon as the required number of players has appeared, chips are distributed and the game starts. This method of starting single-table tournaments has caused them to be referred to as  sit-and-go  ( SNG ) tournaments, because when the required number of players ""sit,"" the tournament ""goes."" Sit-and-go tournaments of more than one table are becoming more common, however, especially in Internet poker. A single-table tournament effectively behaves the same as the  final table  of a multi-table tournament, except that the players all begin with the same number of chips, and the betting structure starts much lower than would likely be the case at a MTT final table. Almost invariably, fixed payoffs are used.     [ edit ]   Betting format   Betting, in tournaments, can take one of three forms:     In a  structured  ( fixed limit ) betting system, bets and raises are restricted to specific amounts, though these amounts typically increase throughout the tournament. For example, for a  seven-card stud  tournament with the stakes at 10/20, raises would be $10 in the first three rounds of betting, and $20 in the latter rounds.       Semi-structured  betting provides ranges for allowed raises. Usually, in this format, one may not raise less than a previous player has raised. For example, if one player raises $20, it would be illegal for another player to raise an additional $5.  Pot limit  is a semi-structured format in which raises cannot exceed the current size of the pot.  Spread limit  is a semi-structured format in which bets (and subsequent raises) must be between a minimum and maximum amount.       Unstructured  betting, usually called  no limit . While blinds, antes, or bring-ins are fixed, players are free to bet as much as they wish, even early in a round of betting. To bet all of one's chips (risking one's tournament life, in the event of losing the hand) is to go  all-in . In no-limit tournaments, players will sometimes take this risk even early in the betting; for example, in some no-limit Texas Hold 'Em tournaments, it is not uncommon for players to bet ""all-in"" before the flop.     The betting structure is one of the most defining elements of the game; even if other aspects are equivalent, a fixed-limit version and its no-limit counterpart are considered to be very  different  games, because the strategies and play styles are very different. For instance, it is much easier to bluff in a no-limit game, which allows aggressive betting, than in a fixed-limit game. No-limit games also vary widely according to the proclivities of the players; an informal,  emergent , betting structure is developed by the players' personal strategies and personalities.   The stakes of each round, as well as  blinds ,  bring-ins , and antes as appropriate per game, typically escalate according either to the time elapsed or the number of hands played.     [ edit ]   Types of poker   While some tournaments offer a mix of games, like  H.O.R.S.E.  events which combine Hold'em, Omaha,  Razz , Stud and Stud Eight or Better and  Dealer's Choice  events, at which one may choose from a similar menu of games, most tournaments feature one form of  stud  or  community card poker , such as  seven-card stud , seven card  high-low  stud,  Omaha Hold 'em  or  Texas Hold 'em . Both Omaha and Texas Hold'em tournaments are commonly offered in fixed-limit,  pot limit , and  no limit  forms.   Sit and gos are another specific type of poker tournament. Regular tournaments begin at a scheduled time, and however many players are registered for that tournament when the starting time approaches, is the number of players that make up that specific tournament. Sit and gos are formatted the same as regular tournaments, except they begin when a certain amount of players register for it. Standard sit and gos usually consist of 2,6,9,10,12,18,24,27,36,45,90,100 or 180 players. Sit and gos are formatted the same as regular tournaments; everyone buys-in to the sit and go for the same amount and every player starts with the same amount of chips. Each player in a sit and go play until all of their chips are gone. As each player is knocked out, they receive money (or don't receive money) according to what place they finish. First place makes the most money, second is rewarded with a little less than first, and so on. Unlike cash games, standard sit and go tournaments increase the blinds and antes every 15 minutes or so in equal intervals. Some sit and gos, called freezeouts, only reward first prize with money, which receives all of the money that the sit and go consisted of from all of the buy-ins from every player in it. Other sit and gos, usually only heads up (1-on-1) sit and gos, don't ever increase the blinds. The blinds stay the same throughout the entire sit and go, causing much more skillful play to be rewarded over the long run, as players aren't as forced to play mediocre hands because of big blinds and antes.     [ edit ]   Tournament venues   Informal tournaments can be organized by a group of friends; for example, most colleges feature poker tournaments.  Casinos  and online gaming sites often offer daily tournaments.   However, these are not the only venues. Poker cruises offer tournaments at sea. Most  2005  and  2006  World Series of Poker events took place in the convention center at the Rio Hotel in  Las Vegas .     [ edit ]   Major tournaments   The two largest and most well-known tournaments are the  World Poker Tour  championship event and the  World Series of Poker , both held in  Las Vegas, Nevada . The World Series has traditionally been featured on  ESPN .   The 2005 World Series of Poker was the first held outside of Binion's Horseshoe Casino, though the final few days of the main event were held in the legendary Benny's Bullpen. Later tournaments have been held at one of the  Harrah's Entertainment  properties; since 2005, the Rio has served as the venue.   One of the most prestigious  European  tournament is the  WSOP Europe , which began in 2007 and is set to be sponsored by  Betfair  until 2011. The inaugural winner was  Annette Obrestad .   In addition to these events, there are other major tournaments throughout the year. The World Poker Tour broadcasts a series of open tournaments throughout the U.S. and Caribbean with buy-ins from $5,000 to $25,000, as well as a European event with a 10,000 buy-in. Some of these events are stand alone tournaments like the  Caribbean Poker Adventure , but most are held in conjunction with a tournament series being held at the host casino, like the  Commerce Casino's  LA Poker Classic, the  Grand Sierra's  World Poker Challenge and the  Bicycle Casino's  Legends of Poker.   Atlantic City  hosts  The United States Poker Championship  at the  Trump Taj Mahal  casino, which has been broadcast by ESPN in recent years.   The main live poker tournament in Africa is the All Africa Poker Tournament hosted by the Piggs Peak Casino in Piggs Peak, Swaziland.   The  Crown Australian Poker Championship , also known as the  Aussie Millions , is fast becoming one of the world's largest tournaments.

clueweb09-en0005-19-24361	"  The Poker Tournament Formula  by Arnold Snyder      click image for larger picture                  The boom in live and online poker tournaments has created an incredibly rich money-making opportunity for smart players who know how to take advantage of it, even players who are trying to build a bankroll.     Many Las Vegas casinos that didn't have poker rooms a few years (or even months) ago are now holding daily no-limit hold'em tournaments where only a handful of players know what they're doing. With over 400 regularly-scheduled poker tournaments a week in Las Vegas, it isn't difficult to play a couple of high-value events a day, if you choose.     And the online poker tournament choices are even richer. Not only are the fields even weaker, but the online poker tournament structures make for a bigger edge for players who know how to extract their value.     This book focuses on ""fast"" poker tournaments. Such tournaments are multi-table, with the blind levels rising quickly, so the tournament is decided in two to seven hours.  The Poker Tournament Formula  explains how to exploit that structure to give yourself the best chance of victory.     The book is easy and fun to read, and easy to understand.              The price is $19.95 plus shipping (plus sales tax if sent to a Nevada address).   The Poker Tournament Formula  is available from      Pi Yee Press         4855 W. Nevso Dr.         Las Vegas, NV 89103          Phone 702-579-7711         E-mail  info@bj21.com      Or use the Pi Yee Press  online order form .           "

Aside from this central guideline, there are many deviations.         It is important to be fully aware of the different types of poker tournaments because they will shape and influence your strategy.         Likewise, whenever you play at an online poker tournament you should know what the playing conditions are at that specific site.         With all the different types of poker tournaments, it is easy to get confused. We attempt to clarify the topic, making it more approachable by providing an overview of the following types of poker tournaments:                   Single Table          Multi Table          Freeroll          Satellite or Qualifier          Sit and Go          Rebuy          Freezeout          Turbo          Steps          Shootout                  It is important to keep in mind that any poker tournament can be a combination of the aforementioned types. For example, a tournament can be both a Satellite and a Multi Table.          Poker Tournament Limit Types                The betting and raising limit type is one of the most critical factors when playing at a poker tournament. The playing styles and strategies tend to vary in accordance with the limit type of the game.                In poker tournaments, betting can have one of five forms:                  Fixed Limit          Limit          No Limit          Pot Limit          Spread Limit                        John Tucker - Editorial Manager                                                                                                                                       Exclusive Deposit Bonus Offer                                                                                                                                                                                                Navigation                                                                           Steps Poker Tournaments Poker on tv Tournament Freeroll Poker Tournaments Freezeout Poker Tournaments Turbo Tournaments Satellite Poker Tournaments Shootout Poker Tournaments Sit and Go Poker Tournaments MultiTable Tournaments Re-buy Poker Tournaments Single Table Tournaments Televised World Series of Poker World Poker Tour USA Poker Championship Legends of poker Caribbean Poker Adventure LA Poker Classic Tournament Poker Million Tournament Ultimate Poker Challenge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Search PokerTeam.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Recommended Poker Rooms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Copyright © 2007 PokerTeam.

The tournament prize pool is split between the top poker tournament finishers.   For example, a poker tournament might pay the first place winner 50%  of the prize pool, the second place winner 30%, and the third place winner 20%.   Large poker tournaments typically pay down a higher quantity of places.  For  example, the  World Poker Tour  Championship  at the Bellagio Casino typically pays the top 50 players.

Entering tournaments, like most other card games, usually requires the would-be player to pay a buy-in (generally at a fixed price). They're then given a clump of tournament chips and sent to play.   Some organizations will allow players to either re-buy or to buy-back, both of which offer players the chance to get more chips if they feel they need them. Sometimes tournaments will only offer re-buy services to players who really need them (in other words they've been on a losing streak), but most of the time any player will be allowed to purchase more chips. Once a player is out of chips and is no longer willing to buy more they are out of the tournament.   Player numbers at each table at poker tournaments is maintained at an even level by constantly moving them around, possibly by swapping one player to a new poker table or breaking up entire tables and distributing their players among other, pre-existing tables. Some tournaments, however, determine ranking by waiting until all other players at a table are eliminated and then moving the remaining player on to the next round.   Prizes for succeeding in the tournament usually come from buy-ins, though funds from outside the players themselves may be introduced as an incentive for more players to join. Some invitation-only poker tournaments, for example, may throw out the buy-in option and fund any prizes and chip pools through sponsorship revenue, possibly receipts from spectators coming in to watch the show. These tournaments are known as freerolls.   The tournament does not end, generally, until all players but one have been eliminated from the tables. Many informal poker tournaments, however, may end by mutual consent between two remaining players.   A tournament may be open or it may be invitational only. For example, the world's most prestigious tournament, The World Series of Poker, is open, though it requires an entrance buy-in of $10,000.                                                      Menu              Online poker        Hold em poker        Poker tournaments        Free online poker        Online texas holdem        Game poker        Poker rule        World series of poker        Poker download        Paradise poker              Poker pacific        Poker site        Poker hands        Online poker rooms        Poker free        Virtual poker        Online poker site        Poker rooms        World poker tour        Poker tables                               © 2005-2008 GenuineGambling.com All rights reserved..            
clueweb09-enwp01-69-06409	"                     Poker tournament          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 An amateur poker tournament in progress.       A  poker tournament  is a  tournament  in which the winners are decided by playing  poker , usually a particular style of poker.   Contrast this to a  ring game , where the game is ongoing with no formal structure to determine a single winner in a certain length of time.           Contents       1   Buy-ins and prizes   2   Betting format   3   Types of poker   4   Tournament venues   5   Major tournaments   6   See also   7   External links               [ edit ]   Buy-ins and prizes   To enter a typical tournament, a player pays a fixed  buy-in  and at the start of play is given a certain quantity of tournament  poker chips . Commercial venues may also charge a separate fee, or withhold a small portion of the buy-in, as the cost of running the event. Tournament chips have only notional value; they have no cash value, and only the tournament chips, not cash, may be used during play. Typically, the amount of each entrant's starting tournament chips is an  integer  multiple of the buy-in. Some tournaments offer the option of a  re-buy  or  buy-back ; this gives players the option of purchasing more chips. In some cases, re-buys are conditional (for example, offered only to players low on or out of chips) but in others they are available to all players (called  add-ons ). When a player has no chips remaining (and has exhausted or declined all re-buy options, if any are available) he or she is eliminated from the tournament.   In most tournaments, the number of players at each table is kept even by moving players, either by switching one player or (as the field shrinks) taking an entire table out of play and distributing its players amongst the remaining tables. A few tournaments, called  shoot-outs , do not do this; instead, the last player (sometimes the last two or more players) at a table moves on to a second or third round, akin to a  single-elimination tournament  found in other games.   The prizes for winning are usually derived from the buy-ins, though outside funds may be entered as well. For example, some invitational tournaments do not have buy-ins and fund their prize pools with  sponsorship  revenue and/or gate receipts from spectators. (These tournaments are referred to as  freerolls .) Play continues, in most tournaments, until all but one player is eliminated, though in some tournament situations, especially informal ones, players have the option of ending by consensus.   Players are ranked in reverse chronological order  the last person in the game earns 1st place, the second-to-last earns 2nd, and so on. This ranking of players by elimination is unique amongst games, and also precludes the possibility of a tie for first place, since one player alone must have all the chips to end the tournament. (Ties are possible for all other places, though they are rare since the sole tiebreaker is the number of chips one has at the start of the hand in which one is eliminated, and hence two people would need to start a hand with the exact same number of chips and both be eliminated on that same hand in order to tie each other.)   Sometimes tournaments end by mutual consensus of the remaining players. For example, in a ten-person, $5 game, there may be two players remaining with $29 and $21, respectively, worth of chips. Rather than risk losing their winning, as one of them would if the game were continued, these two players may be allowed to split the prize proportional to their in-game currency (or however they agree).   Prizes are awarded to the winning players in one of two ways:     Fixed : Each placing corresponds to a certain payoff. For example, a ten-person, $20 buy-in tournament might award $100 to the first-place player, $60 for second-place, $40 for third, and nothing for lower places.       Proportional : Payouts are determined according to a percentage-based scale. The percentages are determined based upon the number of participants and will increase payout positions as participation increases. As a rule, roughly one player in ten will 'cash', or make a high enough place to earn money. These scales are very top-heavy, with the top three players usually winning more than the rest of the paid players combined.     Tournaments can be open or invitational. The  World Series of Poker , whose Main Event (a $10,000 buy-in  no limit   Texas Hold 'Em  tournament) is considered the most prestigious of all poker tournaments, is open.   Multi-table tournaments  involve many players playing simultaneously at dozens or even hundreds of tables.  Satellite tournaments  to high-profile, expensive poker tournaments are the means of entering a major event without posting a significant sum of cash. These have significantly smaller buy-ins, usually on the order of one-tenth to one-fiftieth the main tournament's buy-in, and can be held at various venues across the country and, more recently, on the  Internet . Top players in this event, in lieu of a cash prize, are awarded seats to the main tourney, with the number of places dependent on participation.  Chris Moneymaker , who won the  2003   World Series of Poker  Main Event, was able to afford his seat by winning an Internet tournament with a $39 buy-in.  Greg Raymer ,  2004  World Series of Poker champion, acquired his seat via a $165 Internet tournament.   The opposite of a multi-table tournament is a  single-table tournament,  often abbreviated  STT.  A number of places (typically, nine or ten) are allocated at a single table, and as soon as the required number of players has appeared, chips are distributed and the game starts. This method of starting single-table tournaments has caused them to be referred to as  sit-and-go  ( SNG ) tournaments, because when the required number of players ""sit,"" the tournament ""goes."" Sit-and-go tournaments of more than one table are becoming more common, however, especially in Internet poker. A single-table tournament effectively behaves the same as the  final table  of a multi-table tournament, except that the players all begin with the same number of chips, and the betting structure starts much lower than would likely be the case at a MTT final table. Almost invariably, fixed payoffs are used.     [ edit ]   Betting format   Betting, in tournaments, can take one of three forms:     In a  structured  ( fixed limit ) betting system, bets and raises are restricted to specific amounts, though these amounts typically increase throughout the tournament. For example, for a  seven-card stud  tournament with the stakes at 10/20, raises would be $10 in the first three rounds of betting, and $20 in the latter rounds.       Semi-structured  betting provides ranges for allowed raises. Usually, in this format, one may not raise less than a previous player has raised. For example, if one player raises $20, it would be illegal for another player to raise an additional $5.  Pot limit  is a semi-structured format in which raises cannot exceed the current size of the pot.  Spread limit  is a semi-structured format in which bets (and subsequent raises) must be between a minimum and maximum amount.       Unstructured  betting, usually called  no limit . While blinds, antes, or bring-ins are fixed, players are free to bet as much as they wish, even early in a round of betting. To bet all of one's chips (risking one's tournament life, in the event of losing the hand) is to go  all-in . In no-limit tournaments, players will sometimes take this risk even early in the betting; for example, in some no-limit Texas Hold 'Em tournaments, it is not uncommon for players to bet ""all-in"" before the flop.     The betting structure is one of the most defining elements of the game; even if other aspects are equivalent, a fixed-limit version and its no-limit counterpart are considered to be very  different  games, because the strategies and play styles are very different. For instance, it is much easier to bluff in a no-limit game, which allows aggressive betting, than in a fixed-limit game. No-limit games also vary widely according to the proclivities of the players; an informal,  emergent , betting structure is developed by the players' personal strategies and personalities.   The stakes of each round, as well as  blinds ,  bring-ins , and antes as appropriate per game, typically escalate according either to the time elapsed or the number of hands played.     [ edit ]   Types of poker   While some tournaments offer a mix of games, like  H.O.R.S.E.  events which combine Hold'em, Omaha,  Razz , Stud and Stud Eight or Better and  Dealer's Choice  events, at which one may choose from a similar menu of games, most tournaments feature one form of  stud  or  community card poker , such as  seven-card stud , seven card  high-low  stud,  Omaha Hold 'em  or  Texas Hold 'em . Both Omaha and Texas Hold'em tournaments are commonly offered in fixed-limit,  pot limit , and  no limit  forms.   Sit and gos are another specific type of poker tournament. Regular tournaments begin at a scheduled time, and however many players are registered for that tournament when the starting time approaches, is the number of players that make up that specific tournament. Sit and gos are formatted the same as regular tournaments, except they begin when a certain amount of players register for it. Standard sit and gos usually consist of 2,6,9,10,12,18,24,27,36,45,90,100 or 180 players. Sit and gos are formatted the same as regular tournaments; everyone buys-in to the sit and go for the same amount and every player starts with the same amount of chips. Each player in a sit and go play until all of their chips are gone. As each player is knocked out, they receive money (or don't receive money) according to what place they finish. First place makes the most money, second is rewarded with a little less than first, and so on. Unlike cash games, standard sit and go tournaments increase the blinds and antes every 15 minutes or so in equal intervals. Some sit and gos, called freezeouts, only reward first prize with money, which receives all of the money that the sit and go consisted of from all of the buy-ins from every player in it. Other sit and gos, usually only heads up (1-on-1) sit and gos, don't ever increase the blinds. The blinds stay the same throughout the entire sit and go, causing much more skillful play to be rewarded over the long run, as players aren't as forced to play mediocre hands because of big blinds and antes.     [ edit ]   Tournament venues   Informal tournaments can be organized by a group of friends; for example, most colleges feature poker tournaments.  Casinos  and online gaming sites often offer daily tournaments.   However, these are not the only venues. Poker cruises offer tournaments at sea. Most  2005  and  2006  World Series of Poker events took place in the convention center at the Rio Hotel in  Las Vegas .     [ edit ]   Major tournaments   The two largest and most well-known tournaments are the  World Poker Tour  championship event and the  World Series of Poker , both held in  Las Vegas, Nevada . The World Series has traditionally been featured on  ESPN .   The 2005 World Series of Poker was the first held outside of Binion's Horseshoe Casino, though the final few days of the main event were held in the legendary Benny's Bullpen. Later tournaments have been held at one of the  Harrah's Entertainment  properties; since 2005, the Rio has served as the venue.   One of the most prestigious  European  tournament is the  WSOP Europe , which began in 2007 and is set to be sponsored by  Betfair  until 2011. The inaugural winner was  Annette Obrestad .   In addition to these events, there are other major tournaments throughout the year. The World Poker Tour broadcasts a series of open tournaments throughout the U.S. and Caribbean with buy-ins from $5,000 to $25,000, as well as a European event with a 10,000 buy-in. Some of these events are stand alone tournaments like the  Caribbean Poker Adventure , but most are held in conjunction with a tournament series being held at the host casino, like the  Commerce Casino's  LA Poker Classic, the  Grand Sierra's  World Poker Challenge and the  Bicycle Casino's  Legends of Poker.   Atlantic City  hosts  The United States Poker Championship  at the  Trump Taj Mahal  casino, which has been broadcast by ESPN in recent years.   The main live poker tournament in Africa is the All Africa Poker Tournament hosted by the Piggs Peak Casino in Piggs Peak, Swaziland.   The  Crown Australian Poker Championship , also known as the  Aussie Millions , is fast becoming one of the world's largest tournaments.

It billed itself as the first professional poker league, and was limited to players who have established themselves on the  World Poker Tour ,  World Series of Poker , or major participation on the poker circuit.   Matt Corboy  was the lead commentator, with poker pro  Mark Seif  as color commentator and  Kaye Han  as floor reporter. The first season, taped in 2005, began airing regularly on  Travel Channel  on July 5, 2006 and left the air in 2007.

In addition, each event had 12 exemptions shared between the host casino and WPTE.   PPT withdrew entry from otherwise-qualified players who didn't play at least 2 of the 5 PPT Season 1 events and didn't play at least half of the WPT Season 3 and 4 events. Among the well-known players who were excluded from PPT Season 2 under this rule were  Johnny Chan ,  Sam Farha ,  Phil Gordon ,  Chris Moneymaker , and  Amarillo Slim .     [ edit ]   Planned Second Season   On August 8, 2006, WPT Enterprises announced that the first tournament of the second season of the PPT, at the Borgata Casino in Atlantic City, had been postponed from September 2006. At the time of the postponement, PPT did not have a contract for television coverage of the second season. WPT Enterprises announced on September 28, 2006 that the Foxwoods and Bellagio tournaments were also postponed. While there was no announcement, a tournament scheduled for the Commerce Casino in Los Angeles in February 2007 never took place. The tournaments have since been canceled. When WPT relaunched their website to coincide with their broadcasts moving from  Travel Channel  to  GSN , the Professional Poker Tour section was deleted. The events that comprised the PPT in 2005 were reintegrated into the WPT schedule in 2007-08.

In fact, with poker’s recent rise in popularity - hundreds of thousands of people from the world over involve themselves in Internet based poker tournaments each and every year, and the numbers are quickly growing.    To some, the very concept of entering a “tournament” may seem intimidating, but they aren’t just for the aspiring card professional. These days there are players of all skill levels participating on the tables, and entry fees as low as a couple of dollars.      What Are Online Poker Tournaments?   There are not a lot of significant differences between poker tournaments played in cyberspace and those conducted in the brick and mortar world. The obvious difference is when playing in an online poker game your opponents are not physically seated next to you. Asides from that, the rules and betting structures are normally the same.   Tournaments of all types and sizes are available for online patrons to enter, from single table “pick up” games to massive multi-table events.    Single table tournaments are not unlike what many people are already accustomed to playing on a Saturday night at home with friends - 6, 8 or 10 players at one table, with the top 2 or 3 places dividing the prize money. At just about any online poker room these pick up games run all day long, commencing immediately once a table is filled, and opening a new table to seat the next set of players.   Multi-table tournaments can be comprised of as few as two tables, but it is not uncommon for a larger online tournament to attract thousands of entrants. In theory, due to today’s modern computer and communications technology, it is possible for an online poker tournament to have literally an unlimited number of entrants, as there are no physical limitations to the number of tables they can use.      Games Played at Online Poker Tournaments   In this day and age, nearly any type of poker game can be found played at one poker venue or another. While the increasingly popular Texas Hold ‘Em remains a favorite for large-scale events, there are other types of poker games that have become increasingly popular in the online poker tournament scene in recent years; including 7-Card Stud, Omaha, and their Hi/Lo (split pot) counterparts.     Tournament Buy-Ins   Online poker rooms have the financial advantage of no space constraints and electronic dealers, which allows them to offer much more flexibility when it comes to how low tournament buy-ins can go. For new players or those on a budget, there are entry fees as low as a dollar at some venues, and in some cases, even free tournaments with real prizes for new players (commonly referred to as “freerolls”).   On the other side, for more experienced players and those who prefer higher stakes action, single table buy-ins can go as high as $500 at some places, and direct buy-ins for larger multi-table events often run into the hundreds as well.  Most online tournament operators charge an administrative fee of 10% that is added to the buy-in. A $10 tournament for example, would cost a player $11 in total to enter ($10 + $1). This 10% is where the house gets its profit, with the remainder of the money going towards the prize pool for winning players.     Satellites and Super-Satellites   Some larger tournaments may offer as much as millions of dollars in prizes, which requires large entry fees from it’s participants in order to fund. In some instances, organizers of these poker events will utilize a series of “satellites” and “super satellites” as part of the tournament structure to allow players a chance to work their way up to the main event without the expense of a direct buy-in.   Satellites are essentially inexpensive poker tournaments, the winners from which advance to either a super-satellite (see below) or directly into the main tournament event. These are also occasionally referenced as ‘qualifiers’.   Similarly, a super-satellite is a higher-priced version of a satellite tourney - not as expensive to enter as a direct buy-in, but with a higher entry fee than a regular satellite. Winners advance onto the main tournament event with fees paid, and will also often receive cash prizes as well.     In conclusion, whether you’re just looking for a fun way to challenge your amateur skills or aspiring to be the next World Series Of Poker champion, online tournaments can provide any level of player with a fun poker experience at a price to suit any budget, perhaps of even winning a bit of money along the way. Definitely not just for the pros anymore.

With all the advantages modern players are given, its expected for them to have an accelerated learning curve. Books, programs, internet forums/chat rooms, and television programs have all made it possible for anyone who wants to learn the game to do so. Just a decade ago, these things werent readily available, so when a young kid came along and began to tear up the professional poker scene, it was a big deal. Up until this modern age of poker began the overall vast majority of successful poker players were middle-aged and up, and had spent half a life time mastering a game that college students are now mastering in about 1/50th the time.  Daniel Negreanu     is one of the rare players who both had  a very good mind for the game of poker at an early age,  and just a few years into his poker career began to have the same advantages the older players didnt, making him one of the best all around poker players in the world today. In 1967, seven years before Daniel was born, his parents fled communist Romania in hopes of a better life. His father, Constantin, was a jack of all trades man in his home country, and was hoping he would be able to find work in America in some capacity. After some searching in the USA, Constantin and his wife Annie ventured north, settling in Toronto when Constantin was able to find work as an electrician. On July 26, 1974 Daniel Negreanu was born, the second son of the family. As a teenager Negreanu had a fondness of poker , but his real love at the time was snooker, a game resembling pool. When Negreanu learned that there wasnt much money in the world of snooker, he turned his focus to pool. By age 15 Negreanu was spending the majority of his time in pool halls. When he wasnt playing pool, he would sit in on the poker game in the back room, having modest success, and keeping that in the back of his mind as a possibly money making venture if pool didnt go his way. At this time Negreanu was a self admitted  action junkie , betting on anything anyone would bet him on. He also liked to bet on sports. However, over time Negreanu realized he was making more money sitting in on the poker game than he thought he ever would as a pool hustler. Also, despite just really learning the game, he felt he had an uncanny ability to read people at the poker table, and this was one of the main reasons he decided to focus his attention on poker. School was always sort of a hindrance to Negreanu, getting in the way of the things he really wanted to be doing. When he went to school, he did well, but the trick was getting him there.  Just a few credits short of graduating high school Negreanu dropped out  in favor of playing poker with a fake ID in local casinos and playing home games. The prospect of making a lot of money was much more appealing than studying. All his studying would be done at the poker table from now on. When Negreanu turned 21 he left the poker version of the minor leagues to head to Las Vegas, to test his skills against the sharks of the game. His modest bankroll didnt last long in Vegas, forcing Negreanu to return back to Toronto to  build another bankrol l. He took about a year to do this, and his next trip to Sin City would be a much more successful one. In 1997,  Kid Poker  made his arrival on the tournament poker scene. That summer Negreanu won just the second tournament he ever placed in, a $200 Limit Holdem event in Los Angeles for $18,000. This boost to his bankroll allowed him to travel across the country to Foxwoods casino in Connecticut that winter. There he won two tournaments, including the $1,500 Limit Holdem 1997 World Poker Finals for just over $38,000. That winter alone Negreanu won $55,000 dollars in tournaments, but the World Poker Final victory really put him in the spotlight. Before that success, it was questionable if Negreanu would be able to play in the World Series of Poker that year. But his winter on the East Coast was just a sign of the things to come that spring in the desert. At just 23 years old, Negreanu won the first ever WSOP event he cashed in. The victory in the $2,000 Holdem Pot Limit event earned him $169,460 dollars, and the bankroll to play in any tournament he wanted.   Negreanus success in the WSOP has continued to this day. He is the winner of four WSOP bracelets, including most recently winning the  $2,000 Limit Holdem   event this past year for over $200,000. Negreanu has also found success on the World Poker Tour, where he has won two titles and made seven final tables and he recently won the  British Columbia Poker Championship . Negreanu is also one of the best cash game players in the world. He plays in Bobbys Room in the Bellagio, which famously houses the biggest cash games in the world. When the Wynn opened Negreanu was named Poker Ambassador of the casino, where he played in many of the tournaments there and playing regulars in cash games. Because of this exclusive deal Negreanu was unable to play in other cash games around the city, so in 2005 they amicably announced their split.  Negreanu is one of the most popular poker players not only because of his skills, but because of his easy going personality. Because of his personality he has been able to branch out in a variety of ways. For example, it seems that Negreanu appears on every poker related television show out there, which of course is largely attributed to his personality.   Over the last few years Negreanu has appeared on High Stakes Poker, Poker After Dark, and Ultimate Poker Challenge, just to name a few. Negreanu authored  Power Holdem Strategy  which has been compared to Doyle Brunsons Super System, in that it has a ton of contributions from other poker players. Negreanu is also a regular contributor to CardPlayer Magazine. The truth is, Negreanus life away from the poker table could fill an article all on itself. Negreanu differs from other poker players because he is very open about his poker game and why he makes the decisions he does. Most players prefer to keep this kind of information about themselves out of the public eye. Negreanu hosts a poker forum/blog called  Full Contact Poker , where he is an active member, giving advice to nearly anyone who asks him. Negreanu is also one of the poker pros at  PokerStars   where he doesnt mind conversing with the railbirds while playing in the biggest online tournaments at the same time. As a bit of a superstition,  online poker players have been known to send KidPoker one cent  as they believe it will send them good luck. Negreanu has said that he has received hundreds of dollars from this over the last few years. Also, for a fee costing way more than a penny, you can get tutored by the best players in the game. One of Negreanus most famous pupils is actor Tobey McGuire. Negreanu truly is a poker ambassador. By all accounts he always acts like a gentleman at the table, even if he gets sucked out on. He is always quick to take the time to say hello to his fans both online and live at a table. All of his successes cant possibly be chronicled here, but Im sure before too long one of his projects will be an autobiography.

In a normal casino game each hand is unrelated to another. In a normal poker game, players can also quit whenever they want. In poker tournaments, players can not simply quit and cash out their chips. The play will simply continue until one player has accumulated all the chips.    Here are the different kinds of poker tournaments to choose from:    1. Elimination Poker Tournaments - this is the most common type of poker tournament. The structure of this poker tournament lets all players have the same amount of chips. The play will simply continue until one player has accumulated all the chips.      As players get eliminated, active players are asked to change seats into the fewer and fewer tables.      Even though the winner is supposed to accumulate all the chips, there is still a payout structure that rewards other players. For example if 95 players are in the tournament, the 9 players in the final table will also be given rewards. As the player finishes higher, he or she will get a bigger reward.    2. Rebuy Poker Tournaments  the structure of this poker tournament is for a given time, players who lose all their chips are allowed to rebuy more chips and  Play poker tournaments  on.      Rebuy tournaments have players that play more aggressive in the early part of the poker tournament. This is because they do not face the chance to be eliminated if they lose all their chips.  Rebuy poker tournaments often lead to a larger total prize that is being played for the standard initial entry cost.    3. Shootout tournaments  the tables will not be reduced or combined as players get eliminated. Instead, each table will just play on to have a single winner. Eventually winners of each table will just face off in another table later on.      For example there are 16 poker tables. Later on, the winners of the 16 poker tables will meet head-on elimination style. They will knock out one another till there will be a winner at the finals table.      This type of tournament will last for several hours but still less than elimination poker tournaments.     4. Satellite Poker Tournaments  This kind of poker tournament is the preliminary or mini poker tournaments.      For example before the start of a tournament that has entering costs of a $1000 ten players will battle it out with entering costs of $100 each. The winner will advance to the $1000 dollar entering cost poker tournament.

Poker tournament games  are played by millions of poker players from all over the world.    In every poker tournament some basic similarities are constant:       An initial entry fee is charged by the house in order for the player to participate in the poker tournament.     Every tournament poker player enters the game for the same amount of cash.    The final prize pool is made of all the entering bets made by the players.       The entering fees are usually divided into first, second and third cash prizes. For example, for a poker tournament of 250 players, each entering $400, the total prize money won would be $100,000.      As the poker tournament progresses, more and more poker players are eliminated. As this occurs, the poker tournament approaches a  heads-up situation  . The  blinds  also increase as the online poker tournament takes place. This means the risk factor for each game also rises over time, and the pot grows in proportion.      A poker tournament usually involves only one type of poker such as Texas Hold'em poker or Omaha.     There are variations of poker tournament games, according to how the each tournament game is played.  Single Table Poker Tournaments  will begin at the same time after all poker players are at the table. Players are seated according to the order they arrived to the table. Multi-table poker tournaments have set starting times for games to begin, and players must register some time before the match starts, in order to play in the game. Seating is randomly assigned before the start of the poker tournament. The transfer of players from one table to another is done with consideration to players playing the blinds. During single-table poker tournaments, there are no breaks. In multi-table poker tournaments, there is a five-minute break that happens once an hour.    Another factor that distinguishes poker tournaments are the stakes. Limit tournaments are poker tournaments where there is a set amount of betting stake at each level of the game and each round played, and where only one bet and three raises are permitted for each betting round. In no-limit poker tournaments that amount is opened to the players' decision. Players can raise the stakes how many times they'd like.      There Are several other  poker tournament games options  that differ from the standard Poker Tournament variation. These variations include Turbo Tournaments, Satellite Tournament, Winner-Takes-All Tournaments and Shootout Tournaments. There are Many poker tournaments you can choose from. The most famous ones are the WSOP and the WPT.       WSOP- The biggest and most famous poker tournament is   the WSOP , or the World Series Of Poker.  During the 2005 WSOP poker tournament, Texas Holdem poker player Joseph Hachem won $7.5 and became the WSOP champion. The WSOP has been annually played since 1970.     WPT- also known as the   world poker tour , this is another major poker tournament that is quite different from the WSOP. This tour is fairly recent, since 2003, and is a televised poker tournament that spans many channels worldwide.         Todd Sanders.

Andreas was making poker deposits at an alarming rate of up to      $200 / week, which was of increasing concern. Not only were his      losses mounting, but so was the tension level around the      house...         Andreas felt certain that he was a good poker player, but was      getting more and more frustrated by his inability to resolve the      situation. He noticed he was tilting more and more, finding it      more      difficult to control his emotions at the table.         And then, he made a crucial decision to seek out help - which he      found in a private members' forum not many people know about      yet.           What happened next is nothing short of amazing...

Kinds of Tournaments and Where to Play Them  Playing in Texas Holdem poker tournament and satellite events is a great way to gain valuable experience and play against some awesome players.  First, let's have a look at the different kinds of poker tournament events you can find and participate in.  As you'll see, there's no shortage of tournament opportunities to participate in:     * Online Events - these online tournaments are extremely convenient and therefore highly popular.  There are a number of different types of online tournaments:      1) Sit & Go:  the most popular one and two table tournaments are always running, so you can jump into a quick tourney anytime.  This is a great way to ""get your feet wet"" with some tournament action.      2) Regular Poker Tournament: there are various online tournaments of every imaginable kind.  A couple of my favorites are held regularly on Poker Stars and Party Poker sites - check web sites for more details.  There are tournaments available with entry fees as low as $1 and higher.      3) Free-roll: these are ""free"", play-money tournaments held regularly on Poker Stars.  This is a great way to practice tournament play without risking anything.      4) Four-player: these tournaments begin with 4 players split across two tables, where each pair of two players play against one another ""heads-up"", then the winner of each table heads-up match play the final table heads-up against each other.  This is an awesome way to sharpen your heads-up play.      5) Heads-up: these tournaments are just what it sounds like - two players going heads-up.      6) Satellites:  these are ""qualifier"" events, where the top N players in each satellite event progress to the next higher level, typically an entry into a bigger tournament event.  Chris Moneymaker entered one of these satellite events on Poker Stars and ended up winning the World Series of Poker!      7) Private:  some online sites (like Poker Stars) provide a convenient way to host your own private tournaments.  This is a fantastic way to hold either a local club tournament or get together with a group of people from across the country or world and play together online periodically.  I belong to a local club, and we play in person once per month, and online once per month - very convenient and a lot of fun, too.   * Private Poker Tournament - home games and local poker club events that are taking place in your local area.  You either have to know someone or locate these tournaments through local resources and listings in your area.   * Casino Ship - public tournaments are often held on casino ships that sail from ports around the world.   * Casino Poker Rooms - most casino poker rooms now hold regular tournament events.   * Major Casino Events - the major casinos (e.g., Bellagio, Four Queens, Horseshoe Casino, etc.) hold tournaments on a regular basis.  These major events are preceeded by a number of satellite events, where the entry fees are much more affordable, and you have an opportunity to leverage your play all the way into the big event.  Check the casino web sites for poker tournament schedules.   * World Series of Poker - the original, most famous poker tournament event held each year at the Horseshoe in Las Vegas   * World Poker Tour - the latest in world-class poker tournament events, made famous by its regular TV appearances and large prizes    So, there are many different forms of poker tournament events to choose from.  Next question is, what's it going to be like to play when you get there?  Whether you're an experienced poker professional, casual online poker tournament player, or just getting started, there's one poker tournament book that you really must read.  Learn the Secrets of Winning Texas Holdem Tournaments        A Must-Read for Tournament and Satellite Players  Championship Satellite Strategy, by Tom McEvoy and Brad Daugherty (2003)  I bought this book directly from Tom at a Texas Holdem tournament event hosted at the Four Queens back in 2003.  It's a great tournament strategy book that I highly recommend for anyone engaging in online and offline poker tournament and satellite play.  It discusses the upsides and downsides of playing satellite events and explains the purpose satellite events play in the poker tournament world.  It outlines ""10 Ways to Win a Seat for the World Series"".  It explains how satellite events work and important factors that need to be considered - when you should play in satellite events to save entry-fee money, how many one-table satellites to play, how much money to budget, and much more.  There are chapters on one-table satellites, limit and no-limit winning principles, winning strategies as you progress from round to round, and how to adjust your play at each level and for the number of players at your table.  Brad explains the keys to playing at the final table, including heads-up play.  Finally, there's guidance on how to make the most profits playing satellites by playing the right games at the right times.  If you're serious about poker tournament play, then you definitely need to have this in your hip pocket.

In 2003, he came second in the Legends of Poker tournament taking a prize of $15,410, third in the Grand Slam of Poker event and Fifth at the California State Poker Championship.  In 2005, he managed to have two top ten finishes.  To date, his total winnings are in the region of $83,000.                     So who does he admire?

clueweb09-enwp01-86-02375	"                     Poker tournament          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 An amateur poker tournament in progress.       A  poker tournament  is a  tournament  in which the winners are decided by playing  poker , usually a particular style of poker.   Contrast this to a  ring game , where the game is ongoing with no formal structure to determine a single winner in a certain length of time.           Contents       1   Buy-ins and prizes   2   Betting format   3   Types of poker   4   Tournament venues   5   Major tournaments   6   See also   7   External links               [ edit ]   Buy-ins and prizes   To enter a typical tournament, a player pays a fixed  buy-in  and at the start of play is given a certain quantity of tournament  poker chips . Commercial venues may also charge a separate fee, or withhold a small portion of the buy-in, as the cost of running the event. Tournament chips have only notional value; they have no cash value, and only the tournament chips, not cash, may be used during play. Typically, the amount of each entrant's starting tournament chips is an  integer  multiple of the buy-in. Some tournaments offer the option of a  re-buy  or  buy-back ; this gives players the option of purchasing more chips. In some cases, re-buys are conditional (for example, offered only to players low on or out of chips) but in others they are available to all players (called  add-ons ). When a player has no chips remaining (and has exhausted or declined all re-buy options, if any are available) he or she is eliminated from the tournament.   In most tournaments, the number of players at each table is kept even by moving players, either by switching one player or (as the field shrinks) taking an entire table out of play and distributing its players amongst the remaining tables. A few tournaments, called  shoot-outs , do not do this; instead, the last player (sometimes the last two or more players) at a table moves on to a second or third round, akin to a  single-elimination tournament  found in other games.   The prizes for winning are usually derived from the buy-ins, though outside funds may be entered as well. For example, some invitational tournaments do not have buy-ins and fund their prize pools with  sponsorship  revenue and/or gate receipts from spectators. (These tournaments are referred to as  freerolls .) Play continues, in most tournaments, until all but one player is eliminated, though in some tournament situations, especially informal ones, players have the option of ending by consensus.   Players are ranked in reverse chronological order  the last person in the game earns 1st place, the second-to-last earns 2nd, and so on. This ranking of players by elimination is unique amongst games, and also precludes the possibility of a tie for first place, since one player alone must have all the chips to end the tournament. (Ties are possible for all other places, though they are rare since the sole tiebreaker is the number of chips one has at the start of the hand in which one is eliminated, and hence two people would need to start a hand with the exact same number of chips and both be eliminated on that same hand in order to tie each other.)   Sometimes tournaments end by mutual consensus of the remaining players. For example, in a ten-person, $5 game, there may be two players remaining with $29 and $21, respectively, worth of chips. Rather than risk losing their winning, as one of them would if the game were continued, these two players may be allowed to split the prize proportional to their in-game currency (or however they agree).   Prizes are awarded to the winning players in one of two ways:     Fixed : Each placing corresponds to a certain payoff. For example, a ten-person, $20 buy-in tournament might award $100 to the first-place player, $60 for second-place, $40 for third, and nothing for lower places.       Proportional : Payouts are determined according to a percentage-based scale. The percentages are determined based upon the number of participants and will increase payout positions as participation increases. As a rule, roughly one player in ten will 'cash', or make a high enough place to earn money. These scales are very top-heavy, with the top three players usually winning more than the rest of the paid players combined.     Tournaments can be open or invitational. The  World Series of Poker , whose Main Event (a $10,000 buy-in  no limit   Texas Hold 'Em  tournament) is considered the most prestigious of all poker tournaments, is open.   Multi-table tournaments  involve many players playing simultaneously at dozens or even hundreds of tables.  Satellite tournaments  to high-profile, expensive poker tournaments are the means of entering a major event without posting a significant sum of cash. These have significantly smaller buy-ins, usually on the order of one-tenth to one-fiftieth the main tournament's buy-in, and can be held at various venues across the country and, more recently, on the  Internet . Top players in this event, in lieu of a cash prize, are awarded seats to the main tourney, with the number of places dependent on participation.  Chris Moneymaker , who won the  2003   World Series of Poker  Main Event, was able to afford his seat by winning an Internet tournament with a $39 buy-in.  Greg Raymer ,  2004  World Series of Poker champion, acquired his seat via a $165 Internet tournament.   The opposite of a multi-table tournament is a  single-table tournament,  often abbreviated  STT.  A number of places (typically, nine or ten) are allocated at a single table, and as soon as the required number of players has appeared, chips are distributed and the game starts. This method of starting single-table tournaments has caused them to be referred to as  sit-and-go  ( SNG ) tournaments, because when the required number of players ""sit,"" the tournament ""goes."" Sit-and-go tournaments of more than one table are becoming more common, however, especially in Internet poker. A single-table tournament effectively behaves the same as the  final table  of a multi-table tournament, except that the players all begin with the same number of chips, and the betting structure starts much lower than would likely be the case at a MTT final table. Almost invariably, fixed payoffs are used.     [ edit ]   Betting format   Betting, in tournaments, can take one of three forms:     In a  structured  ( fixed limit ) betting system, bets and raises are restricted to specific amounts, though these amounts typically increase throughout the tournament. For example, for a  seven-card stud  tournament with the stakes at 10/20, raises would be $10 in the first three rounds of betting, and $20 in the latter rounds.       Semi-structured  betting provides ranges for allowed raises. Usually, in this format, one may not raise less than a previous player has raised. For example, if one player raises $20, it would be illegal for another player to raise an additional $5.  Pot limit  is a semi-structured format in which raises cannot exceed the current size of the pot.  Spread limit  is a semi-structured format in which bets (and subsequent raises) must be between a minimum and maximum amount.       Unstructured  betting, usually called  no limit . While blinds, antes, or bring-ins are fixed, players are free to bet as much as they wish, even early in a round of betting. To bet all of one's chips (risking one's tournament life, in the event of losing the hand) is to go  all-in . In no-limit tournaments, players will sometimes take this risk even early in the betting; for example, in some no-limit Texas Hold 'Em tournaments, it is not uncommon for players to bet ""all-in"" before the flop.     The betting structure is one of the most defining elements of the game; even if other aspects are equivalent, a fixed-limit version and its no-limit counterpart are considered to be very  different  games, because the strategies and play styles are very different. For instance, it is much easier to bluff in a no-limit game, which allows aggressive betting, than in a fixed-limit game. No-limit games also vary widely according to the proclivities of the players; an informal,  emergent , betting structure is developed by the players' personal strategies and personalities.   The stakes of each round, as well as  blinds ,  bring-ins , and antes as appropriate per game, typically escalate according either to the time elapsed or the number of hands played.     [ edit ]   Types of poker   While some tournaments offer a mix of games, like  H.O.R.S.E.  events which combine Hold'em, Omaha,  Razz , Stud and Stud Eight or Better and  Dealer's Choice  events, at which one may choose from a similar menu of games, most tournaments feature one form of  stud  or  community card poker , such as  seven-card stud , seven card  high-low  stud,  Omaha Hold 'em  or  Texas Hold 'em . Both Omaha and Texas Hold'em tournaments are commonly offered in fixed-limit,  pot limit , and  no limit  forms.   Sit and gos are another specific type of poker tournament. Regular tournaments begin at a scheduled time, and however many players are registered for that tournament when the starting time approaches, is the number of players that make up that specific tournament. Sit and gos are formatted the same as regular tournaments, except they begin when a certain amount of players register for it. Standard sit and gos usually consist of 2,6,9,10,12,18,24,27,36,45,90,100 or 180 players. Sit and gos are formatted the same as regular tournaments; everyone buys-in to the sit and go for the same amount and every player starts with the same amount of chips. Each player in a sit and go play until all of their chips are gone. As each player is knocked out, they receive money (or don't receive money) according to what place they finish. First place makes the most money, second is rewarded with a little less than first, and so on. Unlike cash games, standard sit and go tournaments increase the blinds and antes every 15 minutes or so in equal intervals. Some sit and gos, called freezeouts, only reward first prize with money, which receives all of the money that the sit and go consisted of from all of the buy-ins from every player in it. Other sit and gos, usually only heads up (1-on-1) sit and gos, don't ever increase the blinds. The blinds stay the same throughout the entire sit and go, causing much more skillful play to be rewarded over the long run, as players aren't as forced to play mediocre hands because of big blinds and antes.     [ edit ]   Tournament venues   Informal tournaments can be organized by a group of friends; for example, most colleges feature poker tournaments.  Casinos  and online gaming sites often offer daily tournaments.   However, these are not the only venues. Poker cruises offer tournaments at sea. Most  2005  and  2006  World Series of Poker events took place in the convention center at the Rio Hotel in  Las Vegas .     [ edit ]   Major tournaments   The two largest and most well-known tournaments are the  World Poker Tour  championship event and the  World Series of Poker , both held in  Las Vegas, Nevada . The World Series has traditionally been featured on  ESPN .   The 2005 World Series of Poker was the first held outside of Binion's Horseshoe Casino, though the final few days of the main event were held in the legendary Benny's Bullpen. Later tournaments have been held at one of the  Harrah's Entertainment  properties; since 2005, the Rio has served as the venue.   One of the most prestigious  European  tournament is the  WSOP Europe , which began in 2007 and is set to be sponsored by  Betfair  until 2011. The inaugural winner was  Annette Obrestad .   In addition to these events, there are other major tournaments throughout the year. The World Poker Tour broadcasts a series of open tournaments throughout the U.S. and Caribbean with buy-ins from $5,000 to $25,000, as well as a European event with a 10,000 buy-in. Some of these events are stand alone tournaments like the  Caribbean Poker Adventure , but most are held in conjunction with a tournament series being held at the host casino, like the  Commerce Casino's  LA Poker Classic, the  Grand Sierra's  World Poker Challenge and the  Bicycle Casino's  Legends of Poker.   Atlantic City  hosts  The United States Poker Championship  at the  Trump Taj Mahal  casino, which has been broadcast by ESPN in recent years.   The main live poker tournament in Africa is the All Africa Poker Tournament hosted by the Piggs Peak Casino in Piggs Peak, Swaziland.   The  Crown Australian Poker Championship , also known as the  Aussie Millions , is fast becoming one of the world's largest tournaments. The 2008 main event saw 780 entrants and a prize pool of AUD 7.8 million; Alexander Kostritsyn won the event and a first prize of AUD 1.65 million. The event has gained sponsorship by Full Tilt Poker and is also filmed for broadcast by FSN. Since 2006, the Aussie Millions has also featured a hold 'em tournament with a buy-in of AUD 100,000, billed as the world's most expensive buy-in.                 v      d      e     Major  poker tournaments             World Series  of Poker             by year       1970     1971     1972     1973     1974     1975     1976     1977     1978     1979     1980     1981     1982     1983     1984     1985     1986     1987     1988     1989     1990     1991     1992     1993     1994     1995     1996     1997     1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007     2008     2009                 Europe       2007     2008                 Other       Circuit events     Tournament of Champions                     Poker tours             World       Season 1     2     3     4     5     6     7                 European       Season 1     2     3     4     5                 Asia Pacific       Season 1     2                 Latin American       Season 1     2                     Late Night Poker     Season 1     2     3     4     5     6               Poker Superstars     Season 1     2     3               Other events     Professional Poker Tour     Poker Million     U.S. Poker Championship     World Heads-Up     National Heads-Up     Ultimate Poker Challenge     Aussie Millions     Grand Prix                 [ edit ]   See also     Tournament director   Sit and go   Public cardroom rules (poker)       [ edit ]   External links     Poker tournament strategy essays   homepokertourney.com  - covers ""home"" tournaments, including blind structures, numbers of chips required, and game timers.

clueweb09-en0007-77-23987	"                The World Poker Tour                               Graphic courtesy  Absolute Poker    World tour poker tournament for amateurs and professionals:                     Courtesy of  Absolute Poker         The World Poker Tour        The World Poker Tour (WPT) is putting tournament poker in the spotlight and is composed of two different aspects. On one hand, it is an elite high stakes Texas Hold'em tournament drawing both amateurs as well as poker professionals. On the other hand, it is a television show on the Travel Channel, intended to hit a massive target audience of novice poker players.       Both the tournament side and the television side of the event are equally impressive. The World Poker Tour has boosted the popularity of poker around the world through its poker tournaments and the WPT television shows seen on the Travel Channel.       The World Poker Tour tournament season begins in July and ends with the World Poker Tour Championship in April at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, Nevada. There are fourteen poker tournaments on the Tour at various locations ranging from Paris, France, to the mainland USA, to a luxury ocean cruise.       The only qualification for entering any of these poker tournaments is showing up with the buy-in which is usually $10,000.       In each of the 14 tournaments preceding the WPT Championship the winner receives both a $25,000 buy in to the World Poker Tour Championship, and the grand prize for the tournament itself.       Individual tournament prizes vary depending on the number of entrants. Make it to the final table of one of these poker tournaments and you get a share of the tournament prize money while your friends get to watch you on television.       In addition to standard tournaments, each season the World Poker Tour holds a celebrity invitational tournament. This tournament pits Hollywood celebrities against poker professionals. Aside from being fun to watch, celebrities have a chance to win a large chunk of money for their favorite charity, as well as a seat at the WPT Championship tournament.       The final table at each World Poker Tour tournament is filmed in front of a live audience and televised on the Travel Channel.       Many features of the WPT television show make it very viewer friendly: small cameras that show each players hole cards, play-by-play commentary, definitions of poker lingo, and on screen displays of percentages, and how these percentages change as cards fall.       Another feature which makes the WPT unique is the commentary. Two commentators give play-by-play commentary throughout the show. One of the more beneficial things this does is provide some background information on each of the players.       Given that not all of the hands that get dealt are televised, the commentators will let the viewing audience know what recently happened off camera - who won, who lost and against whom. They let the audience know why a player might be playing extra tight or loose. It also adds a great deal of color to the show. The commentary is geared more toward the novice player.       You can always buy directly into the World Poker Tour Championship which is held in April as part of Bellagio Casino's World Poker Classic. The game is No Limit Texas Hold'em.       The winner of the 2004 World Poker Tour Championship was Martin Deknijff. The 2004 first place prize was $2,728,356, at the time the largest first prize ever paid in tournament poker.       Players can also get into the World Poker Tour tournaments through satellite poker tournaments. The host casino for each WPT tournament will typically hold satellite poker tournaments.       These satellite tournaments have a smaller buy-in and the winners of the satellite tournaments get their buy-in paid to the World Poker Tour tournament. Bellagio Casino even holds satellite tournaments for the WPT Championship in the weeks preceding the Championship.       The World Poker Tour draws large audiences due to its ability to draw the novice player into the game. Another huge draw of the WPT is that anyone can enter. Most of the tournaments are open to anyone with the money to buy in.       If players do not have the money to spare to buy directly into a tournament, most of the World Poker Tour tournaments have satellite tournaments. This allows novice players to try their hand, potentially winning a spot in one of the WPT tournaments for as little as $10.       The thrill of big money, the ability for anyone to enter, and the high quality television broadcast make the World Poker Tour one of the most popular poker television shows on the air, as well as a very popular series of poker tournaments. A tribute to its popularity, the World Poker Tour Championship, Season 1, was the second highest rated individual program in the Travel Channel history.

Smorgasbord of poker tournaments online  Of all possible and impossible poker variations that have been invented, there's no doubt that the poker tournament has exploded more than any other. Cash games are popular, but poker tournaments are horrendously trendy. And more than anything else, online poker tournaments have become immensely popular. On the internet, you can enjoy poker tournaments in many different varieties. The most basic being the single-table  sit-and-go tournament , which starts as soon as all players have been seated.    The really large online poker tournaments   Multi-table tournaments take more players, sometimes several thousands, and start at a scheduled point in time. Multi table sit-and-gos are a compromise between those two, starting as soon as all players are in place but accepting from 18 up to 180 players (on  Poker Stars ). Most online tournaments are played as ""freezeouts"", which means that you're out when you're out of chips. However, in ""rebuy tournaments"" players may buy more chips during the initial stages of play, for example the first hour. After the initial rebuy period, the tournament goes on like a regular freezeout.    Risk a little to win a lot   No matter what kind of tournament you choose to play in, you'll always enjoy the advantage of a huge leverage: The most you can lose is the buy-in, but with a bit of luck you may win very much more than that, often a factor of 20 or 30 times the buy-in. On the flip side, you may have to play quite a lot of tournaments before you manage to rake in a big win. But then again, the rake you pay, averaged per poker hand you play, is extremely low in online tournament poker. So, shuffle up and deal, enjoy the game, and make it into the money!    Online poker tournament   One of the most popular ways to play poker today is the free poker tournaments online. A free online poker tournament is a poker game where the players all play until one has all the chips and is declared the winner. Unless the tournament is winner take all, the top 10 percent receive some kind of prize, with the winner receiving the largest share and each player after receiving successively less. Online poker tournaments have the same structure, but are played over the Internet rather than in a live casino. There are lots of sites offering online poker in the form of tournaments. One of the oldest, the site Poker Room is well known for good and exciting tournaments.   A big advantage of online poker tournaments is that you can play them from your own home. While the convenience of playing from home is always nice, it can be especially important in an online poker tournament. Poker tournaments, if you play well enough to finish in the money, can take five hours or more to complete. In a live tournament, you will be spending all of that time in the casino. Some players may not have the endurance to spend hours and hours at a casino. For these players the online poker tournament is ideal. It is much easier to play for hours when you have all the comforts of home at your fingertips.   Online poker tournaments are also nice because you can keep constant track of your standing in the tournament. While live poker tournaments do the best they can, it is impossible for them to provide a running total of who has how many chips and how many players remain at all stages of play. During online poker tournaments, all of this information is easily accessible with the click of a mouse and you can factor this information into your decision making during the game.   You can always find a free poker tournament online. Most casinos run at most one or two poker tournaments a day, but online poker tournaments are run around the clock, so you can get tournament experience as often as you like.   If you enjoy free online poker tournaments, you are bound to enjoy online poker tournaments. Log onto your favorite poker website and find yourself an online poker tournament today.

The action is on you .   A willingness to gamble.  I'll give you action  or  There's plenty of action in this game.   A bet, along with all the calls of that bet. For example, if one player makes a $5 bet and three other players call, he is said to have $5 ""in action"", and to have received $15 worth of action on his bet. Usually this term comes into play when figuring side pots when one or more players is all in. See  table stakes .        action button   A marker similar to a kill button, on which a player places an extra forced bet. In a  seven-card stud  high-low game, the action button is awarded to the winner of a  scoop  pot above a certain size, signifying that in the next pot, that player will be required to post an amount representing a completion of the  bring-in  to a full bet. For example, in a stud game with $2 and $4 betting limits and a $1 bring-in, a player with the action button must post $2; after the cards are dealt, the player with the low card must still pay the $1 bring-in, then when the betting reaches the player who posted the $2, he is required to leave it in as a raise of the bring-in (and has the option to raise further). Players in between the bring-in and the action button can just call the bring-in, but they know ahead of time that they will be raised by the action button.    action card   In  Texas hold 'em  or other community card games, a card appearing on the board that causes significant betting action because it helps two or more players. For example, an ace on the flop when two players each hold an ace.    action only   In many cardrooms, with respect to an all-in bet, only a full (or half) bet can be reraised. Anything less than a full (or half) bet is considered to be  action only , that is, other players can call the bet but not raise it. For example, Alice bets $100. Bob calls. Carol goes all in for $119. When the action returns to Alice and Bob, they may only call the extra $19; they cannot raise it. Carol's raise is called  action only . Compare to "" full bet rule "", "" half bet rule "".    active player   A player still involved in the pot. If there are  side pots , an  all-in  player may be active in some pots, but not in others.    add-on   In a live game, to buy more chips before you have busted. In  tournament  play, a single rebuy for which all players are eligible regardless of their stack size. This is usually allowed only once, at the end of the rebuy period.

A specialized version of this is ""buying the blinds"" by making a large raise in the first round forcing all other players out of the game.       [ edit ]   C      call   See  call .    call the clock   A method of discouraging players from taking an excessively long time to act. When someone calls the clock, the player has a set amount of time in which to make up his mind; if he fails to do so, his hand is immediately declared dead.

Typically three or four (in addition the  opening  bet).

Also, term for the chip, token, or object placed atop one's cards to show continued involvement with a hand.    cap game   Similar to ""cap"" above, but used to describe a no-limit or pot limit game with a cap on the amount that a player can bet during the course of a hand.

I'm down 300--I can't catch anything today.  or  Joe caught his flush early, but I caught the boat on seventh street to beat him.  Often used with an adjective to further specify, for example ""catch perfect"", ""catch inside"", ""catch smooth"".    catch up   To successfully complete a  draw , thus defeating a player who previously had a better hand.  I was sure I had Alice beat, but she caught up when that spade fell.    catch perfect   To catch the only two possible cards that will complete a hand and win the pot, usually those leading to a straight flush. Usually used in  Texas hold 'em .

To play a game for a short time and cash out. Also ""hit and run"".   A request made by a player to a dealer after taking a large-denomination chip that he wishes the dealer to make change.

For example, in a $2/$4 stud game with $1  bring-in , a player after the bring-in may raise it to $2, completing what would otherwise be a sub-minimum bet up to the normal minimum. Also in limit games, if one player raises all in for less than the normally required minimum, a later player might complete the raise to the normal minimum (depending on house rules). See  table stakes .    connectors   Two or more cards of consecutive rank.    continuation bet   A bet made after the flop by the player who took the lead in betting before the flop ( Texas hold 'em  and  Omaha hold 'em ).

clueweb09-en0002-47-16767	"                     Poker tournament          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 An amateur poker tournament in progress.       A  poker tournament  is a  tournament  in which the winners are decided by playing  poker , usually a particular style of poker.   Contrast this to a  ring game , where the game is ongoing with no formal structure to determine a single winner in a certain length of time.           Contents       1   Buy-ins and prizes   2   Betting format   3   Types of poker   4   Tournament venues   5   Major tournaments   6   See also   7   External links               [ edit ]   Buy-ins and prizes   To enter a typical tournament, a player pays a fixed  buy-in  and at the start of play is given a certain quantity of tournament  poker chips . Commercial venues may also charge a separate fee, or withhold a small portion of the buy-in, as the cost of running the event. Tournament chips have only notional value; they have no cash value, and only the tournament chips, not cash, may be used during play. Typically, the amount of each entrant's starting tournament chips is an  integer  multiple of the buy-in. Some tournaments offer the option of a  re-buy  or  buy-back ; this gives players the option of purchasing more chips. In some cases, re-buys are conditional (for example, offered only to players low on or out of chips) but in others they are available to all players (called  add-ons ). When a player has no chips remaining (and has exhausted or declined all re-buy options, if any are available) he or she is eliminated from the tournament.   In most tournaments, the number of players at each table is kept even by moving players, either by switching one player or (as the field shrinks) taking an entire table out of play and distributing its players amongst the remaining tables. A few tournaments, called  shoot-outs , do not do this; instead, the last player (sometimes the last two or more players) at a table moves on to a second or third round, akin to a  single-elimination tournament  found in other games.   The prizes for winning are usually derived from the buy-ins, though outside funds may be entered as well. For example, some invitational tournaments do not have buy-ins and fund their prize pools with  sponsorship  revenue and/or gate receipts from spectators. (These tournaments are referred to as  freerolls .) Play continues, in most tournaments, until all but one player is eliminated, though in some tournament situations, especially informal ones, players have the option of ending by consensus.   Players are ranked in reverse chronological order  the last person in the game earns 1st place, the second-to-last earns 2nd, and so on. This ranking of players by elimination is unique amongst games, and also precludes the possibility of a tie for first place, since one player alone must have all the chips to end the tournament. (Ties are possible for all other places, though they are rare since the sole tiebreaker is the number of chips one has at the start of the hand in which one is eliminated, and hence two people would need to start a hand with the exact same number of chips and both be eliminated on that same hand in order to tie each other.)   Sometimes tournaments end by mutual consensus of the remaining players. For example, in a ten-person, $5 game, there may be two players remaining with $29 and $21, respectively, worth of chips. Rather than risk losing their winning, as one of them would if the game were continued, these two players may be allowed to split the prize proportional to their in-game currency (or however they agree).   Prizes are awarded to the winning players in one of two ways:     Fixed : Each placing corresponds to a certain payoff. For example, a ten-person, $20 buy-in tournament might award $100 to the first-place player, $60 for second-place, $40 for third, and nothing for lower places.       Proportional : Payouts are determined according to a percentage-based scale. The percentages are determined based upon the number of participants and will increase payout positions as participation increases. As a rule, roughly one player in ten will 'cash', or make a high enough place to earn money. These scales are very top-heavy, with the top three players usually winning more than the rest of the paid players combined.     Tournaments can be open or invitational. The  World Series of Poker , whose Main Event (a $10,000 buy-in  no limit   Texas Hold 'Em  tournament) is considered the most prestigious of all poker tournaments, is open.   Multi-table tournaments  involve many players playing simultaneously at dozens or even hundreds of tables.  Satellite tournaments  to high-profile, expensive poker tournaments are the means of entering a major event without posting a significant sum of cash. These have significantly smaller buy-ins, usually on the order of one-tenth to one-fiftieth the main tournament's buy-in, and can be held at various venues across the country and, more recently, on the  Internet . Top players in this event, in lieu of a cash prize, are awarded seats to the main tourney, with the number of places dependent on participation.  Chris Moneymaker , who won the  2003   World Series of Poker  Main Event, was able to afford his seat by winning an Internet tournament with a $39 buy-in.  Greg Raymer ,  2004  World Series of Poker champion, acquired his seat via a $165 Internet tournament.   The opposite of a multi-table tournament is a  single-table tournament,  often abbreviated  STT.  A number of places (typically, nine or ten) are allocated at a single table, and as soon as the required number of players has appeared, chips are distributed and the game starts. This method of starting single-table tournaments has caused them to be referred to as  sit-and-go  ( SNG ) tournaments, because when the required number of players ""sit,"" the tournament ""goes."" Sit-and-go tournaments of more than one table are becoming more common, however, especially in Internet poker. A single-table tournament effectively behaves the same as the  final table  of a multi-table tournament, except that the players all begin with the same number of chips, and the betting structure starts much lower than would likely be the case at a MTT final table. Almost invariably, fixed payoffs are used.     [ edit ]   Betting format   Betting, in tournaments, can take one of three forms:     In a  structured  ( fixed limit ) betting system, bets and raises are restricted to specific amounts, though these amounts typically increase throughout the tournament. For example, for a  seven-card stud  tournament with the stakes at 10/20, raises would be $10 in the first three rounds of betting, and $20 in the latter rounds.       Semi-structured  betting provides ranges for allowed raises. Usually, in this format, one may not raise less than a previous player has raised. For example, if one player raises $20, it would be illegal for another player to raise an additional $5.  Pot limit  is a semi-structured format in which raises cannot exceed the current size of the pot.  Spread limit  is a semi-structured format in which bets (and subsequent raises) must be between a minimum and maximum amount.       Unstructured  betting, usually called  no limit . While blinds, antes, or bring-ins are fixed, players are free to bet as much as they wish, even early in a round of betting. To bet all of one's chips (risking one's tournament life, in the event of losing the hand) is to go  all-in . In no-limit tournaments, players will sometimes take this risk even early in the betting; for example, in some no-limit Texas Hold 'Em tournaments, it is not uncommon for players to bet ""all-in"" before the flop.     The betting structure is one of the most defining elements of the game; even if other aspects are equivalent, a fixed-limit version and its no-limit counterpart are considered to be very  different  games, because the strategies and play styles are very different. For instance, it is much easier to bluff in a no-limit game, which allows aggressive betting, than in a fixed-limit game. No-limit games also vary widely according to the proclivities of the players; an informal,  emergent , betting structure is developed by the players' personal strategies and personalities.   The stakes of each round, as well as  blinds ,  bring-ins , and antes as appropriate per game, typically escalate according either to the time elapsed or the number of hands played.     [ edit ]   Types of poker   While some tournaments offer a mix of games, like  H.O.R.S.E.  events which combine Hold'em, Omaha,  Razz , Stud and Stud Eight or Better and  Dealer's Choice  events, at which one may choose from a similar menu of games, most tournaments feature one form of  stud  or  community card poker , such as  seven-card stud , seven card  high-low  stud,  Omaha Hold 'em  or  Texas Hold 'em . Both Omaha and Texas Hold'em tournaments are commonly offered in fixed-limit,  pot limit , and  no limit  forms.   Sit and gos are another specific type of poker tournament. Regular tournaments begin at a scheduled time, and however many players are registered for that tournament when the starting time approaches, is the number of players that make up that specific tournament. Sit and gos are formatted the same as regular tournaments, except they begin when a certain amount of players register for it. Standard sit and gos usually consist of 2,6,9,10,12,18,24,27,36,45,90,100 or 180 players. Sit and gos are formatted the same as regular tournaments; everyone buys-in to the sit and go for the same amount and every player starts with the same amount of chips. Each player in a sit and go play until all of their chips are gone. As each player is knocked out, they receive money (or don't receive money) according to what place they finish. First place makes the most money, second is rewarded with a little less than first, and so on. Unlike cash games, standard sit and go tournaments increase the blinds and antes every 15 minutes or so in equal intervals. Some sit and gos, called freezeouts, only reward first prize with money, which receives all of the money that the sit and go consisted of from all of the buy-ins from every player in it. Other sit and gos, usually only heads up (1-on-1) sit and gos, don't ever increase the blinds. The blinds stay the same throughout the entire sit and go, causing much more skillful play to be rewarded over the long run, as players aren't as forced to play mediocre hands because of big blinds and antes.     [ edit ]   Tournament venues   Informal tournaments can be organized by a group of friends; for example, most colleges feature poker tournaments.  Casinos  and online gaming sites often offer daily tournaments.   However, these are not the only venues. Poker cruises offer tournaments at sea. Most  2005  and  2006  World Series of Poker events took place in the convention center at the Rio Hotel in  Las Vegas .     [ edit ]   Major tournaments   The two largest and most well-known tournaments are the  World Poker Tour  championship event and the  World Series of Poker , both held in  Las Vegas, Nevada . The World Series has traditionally been featured on  ESPN .   The 2005 World Series of Poker was the first held outside of Binion's Horseshoe Casino, though the final few days of the main event were held in the legendary Benny's Bullpen. Later tournaments have been held at one of the  Harrah's Entertainment  properties; since 2005, the Rio has served as the venue.   One of the most prestigious  European  tournament is the  WSOP Europe , which began in 2007 and is set to be sponsored by  Betfair  until 2011. The inaugural winner was  Annette Obrestad .   In addition to these events, there are other major tournaments throughout the year. The World Poker Tour broadcasts a series of open tournaments throughout the U.S. and Caribbean with buy-ins from $5,000 to $25,000, as well as a European event with a 10,000 buy-in. Some of these events are stand alone tournaments like the  Caribbean Poker Adventure , but most are held in conjunction with a tournament series being held at the host casino, like the  Commerce Casino's  LA Poker Classic, the  Grand Sierra's  World Poker Challenge and the  Bicycle Casino's  Legends of Poker.   Atlantic City  hosts  The United States Poker Championship  at the  Trump Taj Mahal  casino, which has been broadcast by ESPN in recent years.   The main live poker tournament in Africa is the All Africa Poker Tournament hosted by the Piggs Peak Casino in Piggs Peak, Swaziland.   The  Crown Australian Poker Championship  also known as the  Aussie Millions  is fast becoming one of the world's largest tournaments. In the 2007 tournament (Won by  Gus Hansen ) there were 747 entrants and a prize pool of AUD$7.47 Million. The event has gained sponsorship by Full Tilt Poker and is also filmed for broadcast by FSN.                 v   ""   d   ""   e     Major  poker tournaments             World Series  of Poker             by year       1970     1971     1972     1973     1974     1975     1976     1977     1978     1979     1980     1981     1982     1983     1984     1985     1986     1987     1988     1989     1990     1991     1992     1993     1994     1995     1996     1997     1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007     2008                 Europe       2007     2008                 Other       Circuit events     Tournament of Champions                     Poker tours             World       Season 1     2     3     4     5     6     7                 European       Season 1     2     3     4     5                 Asia Pacific       Season 1     2                 Latin American       Season 1     2                     Late Night Poker     Season 1     2     3     4     5     6               Poker Superstars     Season 1     2     3               Other events     Professional Poker Tour     Poker Million     U.S. Poker Championship     World Heads-Up     National Heads-Up     Ultimate Poker Challenge     Aussie Millions     Grand Prix                 [ edit ]   See also     Tournament director   Sit and go   Public cardroom rules (poker)       [ edit ]   External links     Poker tournament strategy essays   homepokertourney.com  - covers ""home"" tournaments, including blind structures, numbers of chips required, and game timers.

The Borgata Winter Poker Open was only announced a    relatively short time ago, but a healthy field of 381 players showed up at    Atlantic City's flagship casino for a shot at a $1.17 million...                                                                                   Jack Binion WSOP                            Circuit Main Event                    In August 2005, the World Series of Poker Circuit made its first stop in    Tunica, Mississippi.

That was    nearly 200 fewer players than last year's WPO main event won by John Stolzmann,    but nobody was complaining about the size of the field. With nearly $1 million    going to 1st place, who would say anything negative...                                                                                        Major Poker Tournaments in January                    The start of the new year brings with it a new season of poker tournaments.    This January sees the return of the World Poker Tour to Paradise Island in the    Bahamas, back-to-back WPT and World Series of Poker Circuit events in Tunica,    and the second WPT event in the last 4 months at the Borgata in Atlantic City.                                                                                                                  Online Poker Tournaments in January 2006                    One of the most popular promotions at Full Tilt Poker is Jersey Days, when    tournament winners have the opportunity to win their own personalized FTP    jersey.

As 2005 draws to a close    your time is running out to find a juicy online poker tournament to pad your    bankroll and your gift-giving fund...                                                                                        Online Poker Tournaments in November                    The beginning of each month brings a whole new schedule of    tournaments and promotions at nearly every card room on the internet. Here's a    look at some of the best November has to offer.                                                                                      World Poker Finals                     Among the oldest tournaments included in the World Poker    Tour schedule each year is the World Poker Finals, held at Foxwoods Resort    Casino in Mashantucket, CT. This tournament series has been running since    1992. It was a much different time in the poker world, with the two largest    events drawing only 146 and 137 players - and those tournaments featured a    buy-in of a mere $25! The total prize pool among the 42 events was only    $884,725...                                                                                                                  Paradise Million Dollar Freeroll                     As expected, the response to Paradise's promotion was    enormous.
