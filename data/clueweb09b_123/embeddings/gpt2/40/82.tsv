In the middle of the march of progress, asbestos entered the scene in the 1850s.  It was originally manufactured for roofing, for textiles and for insulation material.  The Yankees putting up factories and mills in the river towns of Lawrence and Lowell and the shipbuilders entering the age of steam surely put asbestos to work in their new structures.   Both commercial freighters and navy ships made ample use of asbestos to insulate in their engine rooms and throughout the ships.  Thats why so many  Navy veterans have fallen prey to asbestos related diseases  such as  asbestosis  and  mesothelioma .  The Boston Navy Shipyard has been building and repairing those ships for decades, its workers exposed to disintegrating asbestos while refitting engines and piping systems.     The list below is a remarkably long collection of locations where  asbestos exposure  likely occurred, to white collar and blue collar workers and teachers and students and hospital workers and mill hands, all of whom had a good chance to be exposed to asbestos in its most dangerous form: when it is crumbling and putting dust in the air contaminated with asbestos fibers.   The Zonolite site in Easthampton is notable for the fact that it processed vermiculite ore shipped from a Libby Montana mine.  The ore was contaminated with asbestos, and so was the insulation material produced from it.  Both the workers at Zonolite and the purchasers of their product were exposed to asbestos.  The Easthampton facility closed in 1992.  The mine and the manufacturing facility belong to W.R. Grace   If you have ever been an employee at one of these locations, discuss the implications of asbestos exposure with your doctor.  If you are suffering from an asbestos related disease, speak with one of our experienced attorneys about the compensation that may be due you from the asbestos companies that made these toxic products.

In 1999 the federal government began tracking mesothelioma deaths with some accuracy.  From 1999 through 2004 there were 483 deaths due to malignant mesothelioma.  This disease has a very long latency period; twenty years is not uncommon.  For that reason, experts expect the rate of mesothelioma deaths to increase slightly over the next few years, even though asbestos products have been off the market since the mid 1980s.

The 330 acre site has undergone major improvements over the past  six years and is home to the annual ten-day Fair in July, the Midway Slots and Simulcast, the Harrington Raceway, The Centre Ice Rink and numerous year-round rental  events.    The three divisions of the Delaware State Fair, the fair itself, the rental facilities and the Centre Ice Rink, have been tied together through a back-end support  system where the State Fair staff can effortlessly manage all aspects of the site. The staff can securely and efficiently regulate all pages of all three sections of  the website. Inclind has honed both the visual appeal and usability of the Delaware State Fair website. The website can be navigated more easily and intuitively.    Visit Website »          International Gem & Jewelry Show       The International Gem & Jewelry Shows (or InterGem) were created in 1967 when Herbert A. Duke, Sr. originated the first commercial gem and jewelry show that  sold directly to the public. They hold more than 80 shows per year in over 30 major U.S. cities and produce the largest exhibition of gems, minerals and jewelry in  the world. The InterGem shows host exhibitors from around the world who offer a wide selection of quality jewelry including loose gems, fashion jewelry, beads and  more.    InterGem can now manage their website through an accompanying back-end support system which allows them to keep up-to-date and maintain the shows, magazine  subscribers and the individual content pages. Inclind replaced the previous solution with a more informative, user-friendly and interactive website that better  represents the elegance of the International Gem & Jewelry Shows.    Visit Website »          Townsends, Inc.        Townsends, Inc. has a rich history that began when entrepreneur John G. Townsend, Jr., started a lumber business in the 1890s. This lumber business expanded into  more than just lumber. It included fresh produce, the first cannery in the Delmarva area, and orchards. In the early 1930s, the Delmarva poultry industry was rising  and the Townsends family became a part of that growth, building its first hatchery in Millsboro, Delaware. Later, the corporation expanded into North Carolina and  Arkansas.    Inclind, Inc. was approached by Townsends, Inc. to create a new Internet presence to completely replace the current solution. The chief aims of the website were  to improve brand recognition and provide more consistent information to the public as well as the sales force. To create improved brand recognition, Townsends, Inc.  needed to become more professional in the presentation of corporate and product information. Inclind has succeeded in creating a solution for the staff at Townsends  to better manage and modify their products and all presented information.    Inclind's proprietary content managed website allow Townsends' staff to modify content pages, add media such as images, animations, and documents, and add, edit  or update all products as needed and instantly. This management ability, as well as the improved look, feel and usability aspects will allow Townsends to better  position itself and its products, resulting in enhanced corporate image and information delivery.

Parrish's  South of Hell  at Pier A Park. If beautiful weather like today's means sunbathing, then sunbathing means the perfect opportunity for some summer reading. Over at Pier A Park (sunbathers central), there are plenty of books being used as pillows and shields from the sun, but there are also plenty actually being read.   Murder mysteries and suspense thrillers were a popular genre earlier this afternoon. Jillian Savarese of Hoboken said crime fiction is her preferred genre and perfect for summer reading. She grabbed  South of Hell  by P.J. Parrish off a CVS shelf for some light reading, but she also recommends  The Woods  by Harlan Coben for fellow murder mystery fans.           Lysa Chen/Hoboken Now Murder mysteries and suspense thrillers were popular among Hoboken sunbathers Sunday afternoon. Savarese was in good company today.   Jen of Hoboken was reading  4th of July  by James Patterson, one of her favorite authors. The book is part of a Patterson series, ""your typical beach read -- short chapters,"" she said.    Alison McCarthy was another Hobokenite with her nose in a suspense thriller.    But  The Narrows  by Michael Connelly is just one of several books McCarthy is reading this summer, she said. (""It's my don't-wanna-think-just-wanna-lay-out book."")    She recommends  One Hundred Years of Solitude  by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, which she described as fiction and magical realism.    ""It's just a Latin American classic, really well written, and one of my favorite books of all time,"" McCarthy said.    Lysa Chen/Hoboken Now Sunbathing is a great opportunity to relax with a book.    Here are some other titles being read in Hoboken:    Liz Brownstein of Hoboken is reading  The Importance of Being Married  by Gemma Townley. It's a bit of good ol' chick lit and was recommended by one of her preferred authors, Brownstein said, adding that she's been rereading a lot of classics this summer.    Laura Ghirardi of Hoboken reads a lot of historical fiction. This afternoon it was  Exile  by Richard North Patterson, about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ghirardi also highly recommended  The Glass Castle , a memoir by Jeanette Walls, which Ghirardi said presents a very different outlook on life.    T.J. Singleton of Jersey City was catching up on his subscription to Fantasy & Science Fiction, a magazine of short stories. This summer he read  The Aeneid  by Virgil (the Robert Fagles translation). What brings Singleton to Hoboken? ""The pier, the view, the sun,"" he said.    Jon of Hoboken is reading  The Janson Directive  by Robert Ludlum. (He's been a fan way before the Bourne movies.) Ludlum is good summer reading, Jon said. ""Winter, spring, summer ... pretty much any time,"" he said.    What are you reading (besides  Hoboken Now , of course)? I just finished David Sedaris'  When You Are Engulfed in Flames  last night and am always looking for some recommendations for a good read.

The  population density  is 11,636.5/km (30,239.2/mi), fourth highest in the nation after neighboring communities of  Guttenberg ,  Union City  and  West New York .

Furthermore 20.18% of those residents also consider themselves to be  Hispanic  or  Latino .

[ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The name ""Hoboken"" was decided upon by  Colonel John Stevens  when he purchased land, on a part of which the city still sits.          100 block of Washington Street              Newark Street looking west       It's believed that the  Lenape  (later called  Delaware Indian ) referred to the area as the land of the tobacco pipe, most likely to refer to the  soapstone  collected there to carve  tobacco pipes , and used a phrase that became Hopoghan Hackingh. [ 12 ]   The first Europeans to live there were  Dutch / Flemish  settlers to  New Netherlands  who may have bastardized the Lenape phrase, though there is no known written documentation to confirm it. It also cannot be confirmed that the American Hoboken is named after the Flemish town  Hoboken , annexed in 1983 to  Antwerp ,  Belgium , [ 13 ]  whose name is derived from Middle Dutch  Hooghe Buechen  or  Hoge Beuken , meaning  High  Beeches  or  Tall Beeches . [ 14 ]  The city has also been cited as having been named after the  Van Hoboken  family of the 17th-century estate in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where there is still a square dedicated to them. It is not known what the area was called in  Jersey Dutch , a Dutch-variant language based on  Zeelandic  and Flemish, with English and possibly Lenape influences, spoken in northern New Jersey during the 18th and 19th centuries.   Like  Weehawken , its neighbor to the north,  Communipaw  and  Harsimus  to the south, Hoboken had many variations in the folks-tongue.  Hoebuck , old Dutch for high bluff and likely referring to Castle Point, was used during the colonial era and later spelled in English as  Hobuck , [ 15 ]   Hobock , [ 16 ]  and  Hoboocken . [ 17 ]   Hoboken's unofficial nickname is now the ""Mile Square City"", but it actually covers an area of two square miles when including the under-water parts in the Hudson River. During the late 19th/early 20th century the population and culture of Hoboken was dominated by German language speakers who sometimes called it ""Little Bremen"", many of whom are buried in  Hoboken Cemetery, North Bergen .   The term "" hobo "" (i.e., a railroad journeyman) is believed to have stemmed from the groups of hobos traveling by railroad from Hoboken.

(January 2009)         [ edit ]   Early and colonial   Hoboken was originally an island, surrounded by the Hudson River on the east and tidal lands at the foot of the  New Jersey Palisades  on the west. It was a seasonal campsite in the territory of the  Hackensack , a phratry of the  Unami   Lenni Lenape , who used the serpentine rock found there to carve pipes. The first recorded European to lay claim the area was  Henry Hudson , an Englishman sailing for the  Dutch East India Company , who anchored his ship the  Halve Maen  ( Half Moon ) at  Weehawken Cove  on  October 2 ,  1609 . Soon after it became part of province of  New Netherland . In 1630,  Michael Pauw , a burgemeester (mayor) of  Amsterdam  and a director of the  West India Company , received a land grant as  patroon  on the condition that he would plant a colony of not fewer than fifty persons within four years on the west bank of what had been named the  North River . Three  Lenape  sold the land that is was to become Hoboken (and part of Jersey City) for 80 fathoms (146 m) of  wampum , 20 fathoms (37 m) of cloth, 12 kettles, six guns, two blankets, one double kettle and half a barrel of beer. These transactions, variously dated as July 12, 1630 and November 22, 1630, represent the earliest known conveyance for the area. Pauw (whose Latinized name is  Pavonia ) neglected to settle the land and he was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633. It was later acquired by  Hendrick Van Vorst , who leased part of the land to  Aert Van Putten , a farmer. In 1643, north of what would be later known as Castle Point, Van Putten built a house and a brewery, North Americas first. In series of Indian and Dutch raids and reprisals, Van Putten was killed and his buildings destroyed, and all residents of Pavonia (as the colony was known) were ordered back to New Amsterdam. Deteriorating relations with the Lenape, its isolation as an island, or relatively long distance from New Amsterdam may have discouraged more settlement. In 1664, the English took possession of  New Amsterdam  with little or no resistance, and in 1668 they confirmed a previous land patent of by Nicolas Verlett. In 1674-75 the area became part of  East Jersey , and he province was divided into four administrative districts, Hoboken becoming part of  Bergen County , where it remained until the creation of Hudson on  February 22 ,  1840 . English-speaking settlers (some relocating from New England) interspersed with the Dutch, but it remained scarcely populated and agrarian. Eventually, the land came into the possession of  William Bayard , who originally supported the revolutionary cause, but became a  Loyalist Tory  after the fall of New York in 1776 when the city and surrounding areas, including the west bank of the re-named Hudson River, were occupied by the British. At the end of the  Revolutionary War , Bayards property was confiscated by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey. In 1784, the land described as ""William Bayard's farm at Hoebuck"" was bought at auction by Colonel  John Stevens  for 18,360 pounds sterling.     [ edit ]   The 19th century          Ferry slips at Terminal              The  Hudson River  during the 1880s, offshore from Hoboken and  Jersey City .       In the early 1800s, Colonel  John Stevens  developed the waterfront as a resort for Manhattanites, a lucrative source of income, which he may have used for testing his many mechanical  inventions . On October 11, 1811 Stevens' ship the  Juliana , began operation as the world's first  steam -powered  ferry  with service between Manhattan and Hoboken. In 1825, he designed and built a  steam locomotive  capable of hauling several passenger cars at his estate. In 1832,  Sybil's Cave  opened as an attraction serving spring water, and after 1841 became a legend, when  Edgar Allan Poe  wrote "" The Mystery of Marie Roget "" about an event that took place there. (In the late 1880s, when the water was found to be contaminated, it was shut and in the 1930s, filled with concrete.) Before his death in 1838, Stevens founded  The Hoboken Land Improvement Company , which during the mid- and late-19th century was managed by his heirs and laid out a regular system of streets, blocks and lots, constructed housing, and developed manufacturing sites. In general, the housing consisted of masonry row houses of three to five stories, some of which survive to the present day, as does the street grid. The advantages of Hoboken as a shipping port and industrial center became apparent.   Hoboken was originally formed as a  township  on  April 9 ,  1849 , from portions of  North Bergen Township . As the town grew in population and employment, many of Hoboken's residents saw a need to incorporate as a full-fledged city, and in a referendum held on  March 29 ,  1855 , ratified an Act of the  New Jersey Legislature  signed the previous day, and the City of Hoboken was born. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]  In the subsequent election, Cornelius V. Clickener became  Hoboken's first mayor . On  March 15 ,  1859 , the Township of Weehawken was created from portions of Hoboken and  North Bergen Township . [ 18 ]   In 1870, based on a bequest from  Edwin A. Stevens ,  Stevens Institute of Technology  was founded at  Castle Point , site of the Stevens family's former estate. By the late 1800s, great shipping lines were using Hoboken as a terminal port, and the  Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad  (later the  Erie Lackawanna Railroad ] developed a railroad terminal at the waterfront. It was also during this time that  German   immigrants , who had been settling in town during most of the century, became the predominant population group in the city, at least partially due to its being a major destination port of the  Hamburg America Line . In addition to the primary industry of shipbuilding, Hoboken became home to  Keuffel and Esser 's three-story factory and in 1884, to  Tietjan and Lang Drydock  (later Todd Shipyards). Well-known companies that developed a major presence in Hoboken after the turn-of the-century included  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea , and  Hostess .     [ edit ]   Birthplace of baseball          Early baseball game played at  Elysian Fields , Hoboken (Currier & Ives lithograph).       The first officially recorded game of  baseball  in US history took place in Hoboken in 1846  [ 20 ]  between  Knickerbocker Club  and  New York Nine  at  Elysian Fields .   In 1845, the  Knickerbocker Club , which had been founded by Alexander Cartwright, began using  Elysian Fields  to play  baseball  due to the lack of suitable grounds on  Manhattan . [ 21 ]  Team members included players of the St George's Cricket Club, the brothers Harry and George Wright, and Henry Chadwick, the English-born journalist who coined the term ""America's Pastime"".   By the 1850s, several  Manhattan -based members of the  National Association of Base Ball Players  were using the grounds as their home field while St George's continued to organize international matches between Canada, England and the United States at the same venue. In 1859, Jack Parr's All England Eleven of professional cricketers played the United States XXII at Hoboken, easily defeating the local competition. Sam Wright and his sons Harry and George Wright played on the defeated United States team-a loss which inadvertently encouraged local players to take up baseball. Henry Chadwick believed that baseball and not cricket should become America's pastime after the game drawing the conclusion that amateur American players did not have the leisure time required to develop cricket skills to the high technical level required of professional players. Harry and George Wright then became two of America's first professional baseball players when Aaron Champion raised funds to found the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869.   In 1865 the grounds hosted a championship match between the  Mutual Club  of  New York  and the  Atlantic Club  of  Brooklyn  that was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured in the  Currier & Ives   lithograph  ""The American National Game of Base Ball"".   With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences in  Brooklyn , enabling promoters there to charge admission to games, the prominence of  Elysian Fields  diminished. In 1868 the leading  Manhattan  club,  Mutual , shifted its home games to the  Union Grounds  in  Brooklyn . In 1880, the founders of the  New York Metropolitans  and  New York Giants  finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan that became known as the  Polo Grounds .     [ edit ]   ""Heaven, Hell or Hoboken""   When the USA decided to enter World War I the  Hamburg-American Line  piers in Hoboken (and New Orleans) were taken under  eminent domain . Federal control of the port and anti-German sentiment led to part of the city being placed under martial law, and many Germans were forcibly moved to  Ellis Island  or left the city altogether. Hoboken became the major point of embarkation and more than three million soldiers, known as "" doughboys "", passed through the city. Their hope for an early return led to  General Pershing 's slogan, "" Heaven ,  Hell  or Hoboken... by  Christmas .""     [ edit ]   Interwar years   Following the war,  Italians , mostly stemming from the  Adriatic  port city of  Molfetta , became the city's major ethnic group, with the  Irish  also having a strong presence. While the city experienced the Depression, jobs in the ships yards and factories were still available, and the ""tenements"" were full. Middle-European Jews, mostly German-speaking, also made their way to the city and established small businesses. The  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  was established on  April 30 ,  1921 . The  Holland Tunnel  was completed in 1927 and the  Lincoln Tunnel  in (1937), allowing for easier vehicular travel between New Jersey and  New York City , bypassing the waterfront.     [ edit ]   Post-World War II   The war provided a shot in the arm for Hoboken as the many industries located in the city were crucial to the war effort. As men went off to battle, more women were hired in the factories, some (most notably,  Todd Shipyards ), offering classes and other incentives to them. Though some returning service men took advantage of GI housing bills, many with strong ethnic and familial ties chose to stay in town. During the fifties, the economy was still driven by  Todd Shipyards ,  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea ,  Hostess  and  Bethlehem Steel  and companies with big plants still not inclined to invest in huge infrastructure elsewhere. Unions were powerful and the pay was good.   By the sixties, though, things began to disintegrate: turn-of-the century housing started to look shabby and feel crowded, shipbuilding was cheaper overseas, and single-story plants surrounded by parking lots made manufacturing and distribution more economical than old brick buildings on congested urban streets. The city appeared to be in the throes of inexorable decline as industries sought (what had been) greener pastures, port operations shifted to larger facilities on  Newark Bay , and the car, truck and plane displaced the railroad and ship as the transportation modes of choice in the United States. Many Hobokenites headed to the suburbs, often the close-by ones in  Bergen  and  Passaic  Counties, and real-estate values declined. Hoboken sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a rundown condition and was often included in lists with other New Jersey cities experiencing the same phenomenon, such as  Paterson ,  Elizabeth ,  Camden , and neighboring  Jersey City .   The old economic underpinnings were gone and nothing new seemed to be on the horizon. Attempts were made to stabilize the population by demolishing the so-called slums along River Street and build subsidized middle-income housing at Marineview Plaza, and in midtown, at Church Towers. Heaps of long uncollected garbage and roving packs of semi-wild dogs were not uncommon sights. [ 22 ]  Though the city had seen better days, Hoboken was never abandoned. New infusions of immigrants, most notably  Puerto Ricans , kept the storefronts open with small businesses and housing stock from being abandoned, but there wasn't much work to be had. Washington Street, commonly called ""the avenue"", was never boarded up, and the tightly-knit neighborhoods remained home to many who were still proud of their city. Stevens stayed a premiere technology school, Maxwell House kept chugging away, and Bethlehem Steel still housed sailors who were dry-docked on its piers. Italian-Americans and other came back to the ""old neighborhood"" to shop for delicatessen. Some streets were ""iffy"", but most were not pulled in at night.     [ edit ]   On the Waterfront   The waterfront defined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from the mid-19th to mid-20th century, by which time it had become essentially industrial (and mostly inaccessible to the general public). The large production plants of  Lipton Tea  and  Maxwell House , and the  drydocks  of  Bethlehem Steel  dominated the northern portion for many years. The southern portion (which had been a US base of the  Hamburg-American Line ) was seized by the federal government under  eminent domain  at outbreak of  World War I , after which it became (with the rest of the Hudson County) a major East Coast cargo-shipping port.  On the Waterfront , consistently listed among the five best American films ever, was shot in Hoboken, dramatically highlighting the rough and tumble lives of  longshoremen  and the infiltration of unions by organized crime.   With the construction of the  interstate highway  system and  containerization  shipping facilities (particularly at  Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal ), the docks became obsolete, and by the 1970s were more or less abandoned. A large swathe of River Street, known as the  Barbary Coast  for its taverns and boarding houses (which had been home for many dockworkers, sailors, merchant marines, and other seamen) was leveled as part of an  urban renewal  project. Though control of the confiscated area had been returned to the city in the 1950s, complex lease agreements with the  Port Authority  gave it little influence on its management. In the 1980s, the waterfront dominated Hoboken politics, with various civic groups and the city government engaging in sometimes nasty, sometimes absurd politics and court cases. By the 1990s, agreements were made with the  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , various levels of government, Hoboken citizens, and private developers to build commercial and residential buildings and ""open spaces"" (mostly along the bulkhead and on the foundation of un-utilized  Pier A ).          Panorama of Manhattan from Pier A.       The northern portion, which had remained in private hands, has also been re-developed. While most of the dry-dock and production facilities were razed to make way for mid-rise apartment houses, many sold as investment ""condos"", some buildings were renovated for adaptive re-use (notably the Tea Building, formerly home to Lipton Tea, and the Machine House, home of the Hoboken Historic Museum). Zoning requires that new construction follow the street grid and limits the height of new construction to retain the architectural character of the city and open sight-lines to the river. Downtown,  Sinatra Park  and  Sinatra Drive  honor the man most consider to be Hoboken's most famous son, while uptown the name Maxwell recalls the factory with its smell of roasting coffee wafting over town and its huge neon ""Good to the Last Drop"" sign, so long a part of the landscape. The midtown section is dominated by the  serpentine rock  outcropping atop of which sits  Stevens Institute of Technology  (which also owns some, as yet, un-developed land on the river). At the foot of the cliff is  Sybil's Cave  (where 19th century day-trippers once came to ""take the waters"" from a natural spring), long sealed shut, though plans for its restoration are in place. The promenade along the river bank is part of the  Hudson River Waterfront Walkway , a state-mandated master plan to connect the municipalities from the  Bayonne Bridge  to  George Washington Bridge  and provide contiguous unhindered access to the water's edge and to create an urban linear park offering expansive views of the Hudson with the spectacular backdrop of the New York skyline.     [ edit ]   Pre- and post-millennium   During the late 1970s and 1980s, the city witnessed a speculation spree, fueled by transplanted New Yorkers and others who bought many turn-of-the-century brownstones in neighborhoods that the still solid middle and working class population had kept intact and by local and out-of-town real-estate investors who bought up late 19th century apartment houses often considered to be tenements. Hoboken experienced a wave of fires, some of which proved to be arson.  Applied Housing , a real-estate investment firm, took advantage of US government incentives to renovate ""sub-standard"" housing and receive subsidized rental payments (commonly know as  Section 8 ), which enabled some low-income, displaced, and disabled residents to move within town. Hoboken attracted artists, musicians, upwardly-mobile commuters (known as yuppies), and ""bohemian types"" interested in the socio-economic possibilities and challenges of a bankrupt New York and who valued the aesthetics of Hoboken's residential, civic and commercial architecture, its sense of community, and relatively (compared to Lower Manhattan) cheaper rents, and quick, train hop away.  Maxwell's  (a live music venue and restaurant) opened and Hoboken became a ""hip"" place to live. Amid this social upheaval, so-called ""newcomers"" displaced some of the ""old-timers"" in the eastern half of the city.   This  gentrification  resembled that of parts of  Brooklyn  and downtown  Jersey City  and Manhattan's  East Village , (and to a lesser degree,  SoHo  and  TriBeCa , which previously had not been residential). The initial presence of artists and young people changed the perception of the place such that others who would not have considered moving there before perceived it as an interesting, safe, exciting, and eventually, desirable. The process continued as many suburbanites, transplanted Americans, internationals, and immigrants (most focused on opportunities in NY/NJ region and proximity to Manhattan) began to make the ""Jersey"" side of the Hudson their home, and the ""real-estate boom"" of the era encouraged many to seek investment opportunities. Empty lots were built on, tenements became condominiums. Hoboken felt the impact of the destruction of the  World Trade Center  intensely, many of its newer residents having worked there. Re-zoning encouraged new construction on former industrial sites on the waterfront and the traditionally more impoverished low-lying west side of the city where, in concert with Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and New Jersey State land-use policy,  transit villages  are now being promoted. Hoboken became, and remains, a focal point in American rediscovery of urban living, and is often used as staging ground for those wishing to move to the New York/New Jersey metropolitan region.     [ edit ]   Government     [ edit ]   Local government          Hoboken City Hall, on Washington Street between First Street and Newark Street.       The City of Hoboken is governed under the  Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council)  system of municipal government by a Mayor and a nine-member City Council. The City Council consists of three members elected at large from the city as a whole, and six members who each represent one of the city's six wards, all of whom are elected to four-year, staggered terms. Candidates run independent of any political party's backing. [ 23 ]   The Mayor of the City of Hoboken is  David Roberts .

Hoboken's political landscape has been shaped by a strong connection between City Hall and the citizens of Hoboken. Many of the people running for mayor / councilman were people who grew up in Hoboken.   Among the most recent elections include:     Thomas Vezzetti  vs. Steve Cappiello (1985; Vezzeti won 6,990 to 6,647)   Patrick Pasculli  vs. Joe Della Fave (1988,1989; Pasculli won)   Anthony Russo  vs. Ira Karasick (1993; Russo won 7,023 to 5,623)   David Roberts  vs.  Anthony Russo  (2001; Roberts won 6,064 to 4,759)   David Roberts  vs. Carol Marsh (2005; Roberts won 5,761 to 4,239.

It connects most NJT  commuter rail lines , various  buses  and now  HudsonBergen Light Rail  with  Port Authority Trans Hudson  rapid transit and  BillyBey Ferry Company  ferry service to  Manhattan .

Murchison in the  Beaux-Arts style , the  rail  and  ferry  terminal buildings were constructed in 1907 as the  Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad  Terminal Complex. The terminal building is listed on the State Register and the  National Register of Historic Places  (added in 1973 as #73001102). [ 1 ]   The large main  waiting room , with its floral and  Greek Revival  motifs in tiled stained glass by  Louis Comfort Tiffany  set atop bands of pale cement, is generally considered one of the finest in the U.S. aesthetically. The terminal exterior extends to over four stories and has a distinguished copper-clad faade with ornate detailing. Its single-story base is constructed of rusticated Indiana limestone. A grand double stair with decorative cast-iron railings within the main waiting room provides an entrance to the upper-level ferry concourse.   The terminal is considered a milestone in American transportation development, combining rail, ferry, tram (later, bus; even later, bus on one side and light-rail on the other), and pedestrian facilities in one of the most innovatively designed and engineered structures in the nation. Hoboken Terminal was also one of the first stations in the world to employ the Bush-type  train shed , which quickly became ubiquitous with station design.   Hoboken Terminal, like Hoboken itself, is a place of ""firsts"". One year before his death,  Thomas Edison  was at the controls for the first departure, in 1930, of a regular-service  electrified train  from Hoboken Terminal to  Montclair, New Jersey . The first installation of central  air-conditioning  in a public space was at Hoboken Terminal, as was the first non-experimental use of  mobile phones . [ 2 ]   The station is unusual for a modern major commuter railroad terminal in that it still makes use of low-level platforms, which require passengers to make use of stairs on the train to board and disembark.   The station has been used for film shoots, including  Funny Girl ,  Once Upon a Time in America , Three Days of the Condor ,  The Station Agent  and  Eric Clapton 's video for his 1996 single "" Change the World "".   A 225-foot (69 m) clock tower was originally built with the terminal over a century ago, but was dismantled in the early 1950s due to structural damage and deterioration from weather damage. A new clock tower, replicating the original, was constructed during the terminal's centennial year of 2007 and was fully erect that November. The replica tower has four foot high copper letters spelling out ""LACKAWANNA"", which are lit at night.     [ edit ]   Services   Hoboken is served by the most rail routes in the entire New Jersey Transit system, including light rail.

Access to the PATH tracks is from the north side of the concourse or the adjacent street. Service is provided 24 hours a day, along the following routes:     Hoboken-33rd Street   Hoboken-World Trade Center   Journal Square-33rd Street (via Hoboken)  (late hour service)       [ edit ]   Hudson-Bergen Light Rail   Hoboken Terminal is the terminus for two of the three  Hudson-Bergen Light Rail  services. The Hoboken Terminal-Tonnelle Avenue service to  North Bergen  and the 22nd Street-Hoboken Terminal service to  Bayonne  (including Bayonne Flyer service) both operate from tracks on the south side of the terminal area. The West Side Avenue-Tonnelle Avenue service bypasses Hoboken Terminal, requiring passengers from stations on the West Side Branch to transfer at stations between  Pavonia-Newport  and  Liberty State Park .     [ edit ]   BillyBey Ferry Company   Passengers can connect to  BillyBey  ferries headed to the  World Financial Center  in  Battery Park City  or the  Wall Street  Ferry Pier in the  Financial District  on weekdays only.

Long known as a  suburb  or  satellite city  of Seattle, [ 3 ]  it is now categorized as an  edge city  or a  boomburb . [ 4 ]  The population was 109,569 at the  2000 census , but by 2006 had grown to an estimated 118,186. [ 5 ]  Bellevue residents are known as Bellevueites.   Downtown Bellevue is undergoing rapid change. It is currently the second largest city center in Washington state with over 35,000 employees and 5,000 residents. [ 6 ]  Based on  per capita income , Bellevue is the 15th wealthiest of 522 communities in the state of Washington. [ 7 ]  Bellevue was recently named number 1 in CNNMoney's list of the best places to live and launch businesses.

Prior to the opening of the  Lake Washington Floating Bridge  in 1940, Bellevue was a rural area with little development. Once the bridge opened, access from  Seattle  improved, and the area gradually grew into a  bedroom community . [ 9 ]          Bellevue seen from Meydenbauer Bay in 1902       Following the 1963 opening of a second bridge across the lake, the  Evergreen Point Floating Bridge , the city began to grow more rapidly. It has since become one of the largest cities in the state, with several high-rise structures in its core and a burgeoning business community. [ 9 ]   Reflective of Bellevue's growth over the years is  Bellevue Square , now one of the largest  shopping centers  in the region. Opened in 1946, [ 9 ]  Bellevue Square underwent a significant expansion in the 1980s. More recently, an expansion to Bellevue Square along Bellevue Way called ""The Lodge"" and the new  One Lincoln Tower  promise to strengthen downtown Bellevue's role as the largest Seattle Eastside shopping and dining destination. The Bravern, a large mixed-use project currently under construction, will feature a  Neiman Marcus  (the first in the Pacific Northwest), along with an assortment of upscale stores.   The city's long-term plans include the Bel-Red Corridor Project, a large-scale planning effort to encourage the redevelopment of a large northern section of the city bordering the adjacent town of  Redmond . [ 10 ]  Patterned after what many civic leaders consider the successful redevelopment of the downtown core, early plans include ""superblock"" mixed use projects similar to  Lincoln Square . Premised on the eventual approval of the extension of light-rail to the Eastside, the city hopes to mitigate transportation problems impeding earlier efforts in redeveloping the downtown core; viewed as an economic development opportunity by many in the business and building development community, the process has focused on infrastructure and the encouragement of private construction in a large-scale urban renewal effort.

[ 11 ]   According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 33.9 square miles (87.8 km), of which, 30.8 square miles (79.6 km) of it is land and 3.2 square miles (8.2 km) of it (9.29%) is water.   The city's name is derived from a  French  term for ""beautiful view"". Under favorable weather conditions, scenic vistas of the  Olympic Mountains  and  Cascade Mountains  can be viewed from hilltops (and strategically-positioned high-rise buildings) within the incorporated city.   The city lies between  Lake Washington  to the west and the smaller  Lake Sammamish  to the east. Much of Bellevue is drained by the  Kelsey Creek  watershed, whose source is located in the Larsen and  Phantom Lake   greenbelt  and whose outlet is near where  Interstate 90  meets Lake Washington's eastern shore. The city is bisected by  Interstate 405  running north-south, and the southern portion is crossed from west to east by Interstate 90. The  State Route 520  freeway roughly delineates the upper reaches of Bellevue.   South of I-90 the citys  Eastgate  neighborhood continues up  Cougar Mountain . To the west of Cougar Mountain, Bellevue includes  Coal Creek  and  Factoria .   Bellevue is bordered by the cities of  Kirkland  to the north and  Redmond  to the northeast along the  Overlake  and  Crossroads   neighborhoods . Across the short  East Channel Bridge , I-90 connects Bellevue to  Mercer Island  to the southwest.  Issaquah  is to the east, down I-90 at the south end of Lake Sammamish. The city is also bordered to the west by the extremely wealthy [ citation needed ]  suburbs of  Medina ,  Clyde Hill ,  Hunts Point  and  Yarrow Point . The south end of Bellevue is bordered by the city of  Renton , and to the southeast, the relatively recently incorporated city of  Newcastle .     [ edit ]   Transportation   Bellevue is the main Eastside hub for both the local transit authority,  King County Metro , and  Sound Transit , the regional transit system. The Bellevue Transit Center, which serves both Metro and Sound buses, is located in the heart of the downtown business district and is connected to Interstate 405 by NE 6th St. and a direct-access  Texas T  HOV ramp. Local buses run into Kirkland, Redmond, Issaquah, Renton, and the University District [ 12 ] ; regional buses go to Bothell, Lynnwood, Everett, Seattle, Renton, Kent, Auburn and Federal Way, among other cities. [ 13 ]   The  East Link  light rail line is planned to run from Seattle through Mercer Island and Bellevue before ending in Redmond. A measure including this and other regional road and transit projects went before voters on November 4, 2008 and was approved. However, the financial uncertainty of the area's other numerous transportation projects reflect the political fragmentation of the Puget Sound area. What is becoming apparent are the increasing costs associated with the central Puget Sound's regional transportation infrastructure. [ 14 ]   The City of Bellevue has undertaken an extensive ""Bel-Red Area Transformation"" process which seeks to plan some 900 acres (3.6 km 2 ) in the northern portion of the city [ 15 ] , all of which is premised on the extension of light rail to the Eastside under Sound Transit 2. [ 16 ]  The top-down and highly integrated land use and transportation planning is similar to earlier planning for the Downtown.   Bellevue is also served by a  railroad , a  Burlington Northern  branch line known as the  Woodinville Subdivision , which includes the historic  Wilburton Trestle . This local freight line is the subject of a controversial plan by King County to remove the rails and replace them with a  bicycle  trail. In response, a  grass roots  movement has sprung up to both save the railroad and begin a rail transit service on it as an alternative to the heavily congested I-405 freeway, which runs roughly parallel to it. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Bellevue City Hall       Bellevue has a Council-Manager form of government with seven, non-partisan council members elected at large for staggered four-year terms. [ 18 ]  The City Council selects a Mayor from among its members, who serves as council chair but has no veto power. As of 2006, the mayor is Grant Degginger and the city's manager is Steve Sarkozy. [ citation needed ]   The position of Mayor is largely ceremonial in Bellevue as the City Manager runs the City's day-to-day operations. The mayor runs council meetings, helps choose the issues that get on the council's meeting agendas, and serves as the city's most visible spokesperson. The position of Mayor is part-time. In practice, operational authority is held by the City Manager, the position that supervises an employee/consultant form of municipal authority. Indeed, more consideration is given the selection of City Manager than many candidates for City Council, the position of Mayor elected not by popular vote but by the seven members of Council.   In the  2004 U.S. presidential election , Bellevue residents cast 57.10% of their votes for  Democrat   John Kerry . [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Education       Main article:  Bellevue School District       Bellevue is home to  Bellevue Community College  (BCC) and  City University . The highly rated [ citation needed ]  BCC is the largest [ citation needed ]  community college in Washington and the third largest institution of higher education in the state [ citation needed ] .   The city hosts the  Bellevue School District . There are four main public  high schools  -  Bellevue High School ,  Interlake High School ,  Newport High School , and  Sammamish High School , as well as two alternative high schools,  International School  and Robinswood High School.   At the elementary level, Bellevue is home to the Eastside's only  Waldorf Education , at Three Cedars School, and to several  Montessori  schools [ citation needed ] .     [ edit ]   Economy   With its immediate proximity to  Redmond , home of  Microsoft , and direct highway access to  Seattle  via  Interstate 90  and  State Route 520 , Bellevue is now home to the headquarters of many small and large businesses. Many of these are technology companies, most started in the 1990s. The city has numerous thriving commercial districts. It also immediately borders the tiny but extremely affluent [ citation needed ]   Lake Washington  Gold Coast [ citation needed ] [ clarification needed ]  district ( Medina ,  Hunts Point ,  Clyde Hill , and  Yarrow Point ), whose residents include  Bill Gates  and control a large portion of the local wealth [ citation needed ] .

[ edit ]   Demographics   As of the  census [ 1 ]  of 2000, there were 109,569 people, 45,836 households, and 29,060 families residing in the city. The  population density  was 3,563.6 people per square mile (1,375.8/km). There were 48,396 housing units at an average density of 1,574.0/sq mi (607.7/km).

[ edit ]   Crime   Bellevue was rated one of the 25 safest cities in America [ 22 ] , based on the per-capita incidence of violent crime. On the same subject, the  Bellevue Police Department  is strongly supported by the community. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Culture   Bellevue is the site of the popular annual  Bellevue Arts and Crafts Fair  (originally Pacific Northwest Arts and Crafts Fair), held since 1947 at the end of July.          Bellevue Arts Museum       The  Bellevue Arts Museum  first opened in 1975, then moved to Bellevue Square in 1983. In 2001 the museum moved into its own building, designed by  Steven Holl . The museum subsequently ran into financial difficulties and was forced to close to the public in 2003. After a lengthy fundraising campaign, a remodel, and a new mission to become a national centre for the fine art of craft and design, the museum re-opened on June 18, 2005 with an exhibition of teapots. [ 24 ]   The Rosalie Whyel Museum of Doll Art contains one of the largest doll collections in the worldmore than a thousand dollsdisplayed on two floors of a Victorian-style building. [ 25 ]   Opened in December 2005, Bellevues newest museum to date is KidsQuest Childrens Museum. Located in Factoria Mall, a shopping complex in the midst of a major remodel, its primary visitors are mothers and care givers with children from pre-crawlers to 12 years of age. Its 10,000-square-foot (930 m 2 ) space houses play and discovery areas, exhibits, offices, educational activities and classroom space.   The biennial Bellevue Sculpture Exhibition draws thousands of visitors to the Downtown Park to view up to 46 three-dimensional artworks from artists around the country.   Bellevue holds an annual Strawberry Festival to celebrate its strawberry farming history.  [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Sports             This section  does not  cite  any  references or sources .

Today, it is one of the largest and most diverse neighborhoods in New York City and has expanded well beyond its original boundaries. Flushing's diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside here including people of European, Asian, Hispanic and African-American descent. It is part of the  Fifth Congressional District , which encompasses the entire northeastern shore of Queens County, and extends into neighboring  Nassau County . Flushing is serviced by five railroad stations on the  Long Island Rail Road   Port Washington Branch  and the  New York City Subway   Number 7 subway line  has its terminus at Main Street.   Flushing is part of  Queens Community Board 7 [ 1 ]  and is bounded by Flushing Meadows-Corona Park to the West,  Francis Lewis Boulevard  to the East, Union Turnpike to the South and Willets Point Boulevard to the North.

The village was named after the city of  Vlissingen , in the southwestern  Netherlands , the main port of the company.   In its early days, the village of Flushing was inhabited by English colonists, among them a farmer named  John Bowne . John Bowne defied a prohibition imposed by New Amsterdam Director-General  Peter Stuyvesant  on harboring Quakers by allowing  Quaker  meetings in his home. Today, landmarks from the Dutch period in Flushing include the  John Bowne House  on Bowne Street and the  Old Quaker Meeting House  on  Northern Boulevard .   The  Flushing Remonstrance , signed in Flushing on December 27, 1657, protested religious persecution and eventually led to the decision by the Dutch West India Company to allow Quakers and others to worship freely. As such, Flushing is claimed to be a birthplace of religious freedom in the new world.  [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   English colonial history   In 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, ending Dutch control of the colony, and renamed it New York. Flushing remained a small Long Island village.   Flushing was the site of the first commercial  tree nurseries  in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. Much of the northern section of  Kissena Park , former site of the Parsons nursery, still contains a wide variety of exotic trees. The naming of streets intersecting Kissena Boulevard on its way toward Kissena Park celebrates this fact (Ash Avenue, Beech, Cherry ...Poplar, Quince, Rose). Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward project, now known as  Central Park  in Manhattan.   During the American Revolution, Flushing, along with most settlements in present-day Queens County, favored the British and quartered British troops. Following the  Battle of Long Island ,  Nathan Hale , an officer in the  Continental Army , was apprehended near Flushing Bay while on what was probably an intelligence gathering mission and was later hanged.   The 1785  Kingsland Homestead , originally the residence of a wealthy  Quaker  merchant, now serves as the home of the  Queens Historical Society . [ 3 ]   The 1790 United States census recorded that 5,393 people lived in what is present-day Queens County.     [ edit ]   Nineteenth century   During the 1800s, as New York City continued to grow in population and economic strength, Flushing's proximity to Manhattan was critical to its growth and transformation to a fashionable residential area.          Map of Flushing in 1891.       In 1813, the village of Flushing was incorporated into the Town of Flushing. By the mid-1860s, Queens County had 30,429 residents. Flushing's expansion continued in 1867 and 1868 when the neighboring villages of College Point and Whitestone were incorporated into the Town of Flushing.   In 1898, although opposed to the proposal, Flushing along with a re-drawn Queens County was consolidated into the City of New York. Local farmland continued to be subdivided and developed transforming Flushing into a densely populated neighborhood of New York City.     [ edit ]   Twentieth century and World's Fairs   The continued construction of bridges over the Flushing River and the development of other roads increased the volume of vehicular traffic into Flushing. In 1909, the construction of the  Queensborough Bridge  over the  East River  connected Queens County to  midtown Manhattan .   The introduction of rail road service to Manhattan in 1910 by the Long Island Rail Road Port Washington Branch and in 1928 by the New York City Transit Authority's Number 7 subway line hastened the continued transformation of Flushing to a commuter suburb and commercial center. Due to increased traffic, a main roadway through Flushing named Broadway was widened and renamed Northern Boulevard.   Flushing was a forerunner of Hollywood, when the young American film industry was still based on the East Coast and  Chicago . Decades later, the  RKO  Keith's movie palace would host  vaudeville  acts and appearances by the likes of  Mickey Rooney ,  The Marx Brothers  and  Bob Hope . The theater now lies vacant and in disrepair due to an unauthorized real estate development project that took place in the early 1990s.   The  1939-1940 World's Fair  was held in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. [ 4 ]  Massive preparations for the Fair began in 1936 and included the elimination of the Corona dumps. Among the innovations presented to the world in 1939 was the  television , which broadcast a speech by  Franklin D. Roosevelt .   After the World's Fair, the New York City pavilion was converted into the temporary headquarters of the United Nations where, in 1947, the  UN voted  in favor of the establishment of the  State of Israel .   A second World's Fair, the  1964-1965 World's Fair  was also held at the site of the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.  Pope Paul VI  attended the Fair on October 4, 1965. On this papal trip, Pope Paul VI became the first pope to visit the United States. An  exedra  now commemorates the site of the Vatican pavilion.  Michelangelo 's masterpiece, the  Piet , was exhibited during his trip.   Following the Fair, the  Unisphere , the New York State Pavilion and the New York City Pavilion remained in the park. The NYC Pavilion was converted into an ice-skating rink and later, the ice rink became the Queens Museum of Art.     [ edit ]   Landmarks, museums and cultural institutions   There are numerous historic structures located in Flushing.   Flushing Town Hall  [1]  is located on Northern Boulevard and is the headquarters of the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts. It is an affiliate of the  Smithsonian Institution  in Washington, D.C.  [ 5 ]  The building houses a concert hall and cultural center and is one of the sites designated along the Queens Historical Society's Freedom Mile  [2] .   Other registered New York City Landmarks include the  Bowne House ,  Kingsland Homestead ,  Old Quaker Meeting House  (1694),  Flushing High School , St. George's Church (1854), the  Lewis H. Latimer House , the former  RKO  Keith's movie theater, the United States Post Office on Main Street and the  Unisphere , a 12-story high, stainless steel globe that served as the centerpiece for the  1964 New York World's Fair . The Flushing Armory, on Northern Boulevard, was formerly used by the National Guard. Presently, the Queens North Task Force of the  New York City Police Department  uses this building. [ 6 ]  In 2005, the Fitzgerald-Ginsberg Mansion [3]  on Bayside Avenue and in 2007, the Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden  [4]  were designated as landmarks.          Marker of the two time capsules       Several attractions originally developed for the World's Fairs in  Flushing Meadows-Corona Park  are worth visiting. There is a stone marker for the two 5,000-year  Westinghouse Time Capsules  made of special  alloys  buried in the park, chronicling 20th Century life in the United States dedicated both in 1938 and 1965. Also located in the park are the  Queens Museum of Art  which features a scale model of the City of New York, the largest architectural model ever built; Queens Theatre in the Park  [5] ; the  New York Hall of Science  and the  Queens Zoo .   The  Queens Botanical Garden  located on Main Street, has been in operation continuously since its opening as an exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair. The Botanical Garden carries on Flushing's nearly three centuries long horticultural tradition, dating back to its once famed tree nurseries and seed farms.     [ edit ]   Demographics   The 2000 United States Census Bureau ranked Queens County as the ninth most populous county in the United States with over 2.2 million residents. According to the Census Bureau, Queens County experienced over a 14% increase in population since the 1990 census.   The 2000 Census also reflected the growth of the  Asian American  population in Queens County with over 391,500 people identifying themselves as Asian Americans. That number was the largest in New York City, more than twice the number of people identifying themselves as  Asian-American  in Brooklyn. The 2000 Census revealed that the 5th Congressional District had almost 655,000 residents. Approximately 364,200 residents or 55% of the District identified themselves as white. A total of 160,896 residents or 25% of the District identified themselves as Asian Americans and 153,721 or 24% identified themselves as Hispanic.   [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Religion   Flushing is a very religiously diverse community in America (if not the most). There are ""over 200 places of worship in a small urban neighborhood about 2.5 square miles [6.5 square kilometers]."" [ 9 ]  ""Flushing has become a model for religious pluralism in America, says R. Scott Hanson, a visiting assistant professor of history at the State University of New York at Binghamton and an affiliate of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University."" [ 10 ]   In 1657, while Flushing was still a Dutch settlement, a document known as the  Flushing Remonstrance  was created by Edward Hart, the town clerk, where some thirty ordinary citizens protested a ban imposed by Peter Stuyvesant, the director general of New Amsterdam, forbidding the harboring of Quakers. The Flushing Remonstrance cited the Flushing Town charter of 1645 which promised liberty of conscience. [ 11 ]   Today, Flushing abounds in houses of worship, ranging from the Dutch colonial epoch Quaker Meeting House, St. George's Episcopal Church, the Free Synagogue of Flushing, St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - the largest Greek Orthodox Church in the United States. The New York Times     [ edit ]   Ethnic culture          Roosevelt Avenue is one of the main commercial streets in Flushing.       The intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, the business center for Flushing located at the terminus of the Number 7 subway line on the westernmost edge of the neighborhood has a concentration of Chinese and Korean small businesses among others. Today, this area is also known for its selection of authentic Chinese, Korean and Asian restaurants.   Other areas of Flushing continue to maintain a large Italian and Greek presence reflected in the many Italian and Greek bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants in the northern and eastern sections of the neighborhood.   An area south of Franklin Avenue is home to an Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi market. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Neighborhoods   Broadway-Flushing , also known as North Flushing, is a residential area with many large homes. Part of this area has been designated a State and Federal historic district due to the elegant, park-like character of the neighborhood. Recently much of the area was rezoned by the City of New York to preserve the low density, residential quality of the area. The neighborhood awaits designation as an Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Broadway-Flushing is bounded by 29 th  Avenue to the north, Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue to the south, 155 st  to the west and 172 nd  Streets to the east. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Parks   All the public parks and playgrounds in Flushing are supervised by the  New York City Department of Parks and Recreation . For Queens County, the Department of Parks and Recreation is headquartered at The Overlook in Forest Park located in Kew Gardens.     Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , a 1,255-acre (5.08 km 2 ) park, is considered a flagship park in Queens. The site hosted two World's Fairs, the first in 1939-1940 and the second in 1964-1965. As the result, the park infrastructure reflects the construction undertaken for the Fairs. Also located here is Citi Field and the National Tennis Center which is the home of the US Tennis Open. In 2008, a new Aquatic Center was opened in the park [6] .       Kissena Park  is a 234-acre (0.95 km 2 ) park with a lake as a centerpiece.

Hoboken lies on the west bank of the  Hudson River  across from the  Manhattan ,  New York City  neighborhoods of the  West Village  and  Chelsea  between  Weehawken Cove  and  Union City  at the north and  Jersey City  (the county seat) at the south and west.   According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 5.1 km (2.0 mi). 3.3 km (1.3 mi) of it is land and 1.8 km (0.7 mi) of it is water. The total area is 35.35% water.   Hoboken has 48 streets laid out in a grid, with numbered streets running east-west. Many north-south streets were named for US presidents (Washington, Adams, Madison, Monroe), though Clinton Street likely honors 19th century politician  DeWitt Clinton .   Hoboken's  zip code  is 07030 and its  area code  is  201  with  551   overlaid .

The  population density  is 11,636.5/km (30,239.2/mi), fourth highest in the nation after neighboring communities of  Guttenberg ,  Union City  and  West New York . [ 8 ]  There are 19,915 housing units at an average density of 6,007.2/km (15,610.7/mi).

Furthermore 20.18% of those residents also consider themselves to be  Hispanic  or  Latino .   There are 19,418 households out of which 11.4% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 23.8% are  married couples  living together, 9.0% have a female householder with no husband present, and 64.8% are non-families. 41.8% of all households are made up of individuals and 8.0% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 1.92 and the average family size is 2.73.   In the city the population is spread out with 10.5% under the age of 18, 15.3% from 18 to 24, 51.7% from 25 to 44, 13.5% from 45 to 64, and 9.0% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 30 years. For every 100 females, age 18 and over, there are 103.9 males.   The median income for a household in the city as of the last census was $62,550, while the median income for a family was $67,500 (these figures had risen to $96,786 and $107,375 respectively as of a 2007 estimate [ 9 ] ). Males had a median income of $54,870 versus $46,826 for females. The  per capita income  for the city was $43,195. 11.0% of the population and 10.0% of families are below the  poverty line . Out of the total population, 23.6% of those under the age of 18 and 20.7% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.   The city is a  bedroom community  of  New York City , where most of its employed residents work. [ 10 ]  Up to 25% of the population (as of 2008) works in finance or real estate. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The name ""Hoboken"" was decided upon by  Colonel John Stevens  when he purchased land, on a part of which the city still sits.          100 block of Washington Street              Newark Street looking west       It's believed that the  Lenape  (later called  Delaware Indian ) referred to the area as the land of the tobacco pipe, most likely to refer to the  soapstone  collected there to carve  tobacco pipes , and used a phrase that became Hopoghan Hackingh. [ 12 ]   The first Europeans to live there were  Dutch / Flemish  settlers to  New Netherlands  who may have bastardized the Lenape phrase, though there is no known written documentation to confirm it. It also cannot be confirmed that the American Hoboken is named after the Flemish town  Hoboken , annexed in 1983 to  Antwerp ,  Belgium , [ 13 ]  whose name is derived from Middle Dutch  Hooghe Buechen  or  Hoge Beuken , meaning  High  Beeches  or  Tall Beeches . [ 14 ]  The city has also been cited as having been named after the  Van Hoboken  family of the 17th-century estate in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where there is still a square dedicated to them. It is not known what the area was called in  Jersey Dutch , a Dutch-variant language based on  Zeelandic  and Flemish, with English and possibly Lenape influences, spoken in northern New Jersey during the 18th and 19th centuries.   Like  Weehawken , its neighbor to the north,  Communipaw  and  Harsimus  to the south, Hoboken had many variations in the folks-tongue.  Hoebuck , old Dutch for high bluff and likely referring to Castle Point, was used during the colonial era and later spelled in English as  Hobuck , [ 15 ]   Hobock , [ 16 ]  and  Hoboocken . [ 17 ]   Hoboken's unofficial nickname is now the ""Mile Square City"", but it actually covers an area of two square miles when including the under-water parts in the Hudson River. During the late 19th/early 20th century the population and culture of Hoboken was dominated by German language speakers who sometimes called it ""Little Bremen"", many of whom are buried in  Hoboken Cemetery, North Bergen .   The term "" hobo "" (i.e., a railroad journeyman) is believed to have stemmed from the groups of hobos traveling by railroad from Hoboken.

Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (January 2009)         [ edit ]   Early and colonial   Hoboken was originally an island, surrounded by the Hudson River on the east and tidal lands at the foot of the  New Jersey Palisades  on the west. It was a seasonal campsite in the territory of the  Hackensack , a phratry of the  Unami   Lenni Lenape , who used the serpentine rock found there to carve pipes. The first recorded European to lay claim the area was  Henry Hudson , an Englishman sailing for the  Dutch East India Company , who anchored his ship the  Halve Maen  ( Half Moon ) at  Weehawken Cove  on  October 2 ,  1609 . Soon after it became part of province of  New Netherland . In 1630,  Michael Pauw , a burgemeester (mayor) of  Amsterdam  and a director of the  West India Company , received a land grant as  patroon  on the condition that he would plant a colony of not fewer than fifty persons within four years on the west bank of what had been named the  North River . Three  Lenape  sold the land that is was to become Hoboken (and part of Jersey City) for 80 fathoms (146 m) of  wampum , 20 fathoms (37 m) of cloth, 12 kettles, six guns, two blankets, one double kettle and half a barrel of beer. These transactions, variously dated as July 12, 1630 and November 22, 1630, represent the earliest known conveyance for the area. Pauw (whose Latinized name is  Pavonia ) neglected to settle the land and he was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633. It was later acquired by  Hendrick Van Vorst , who leased part of the land to  Aert Van Putten , a farmer. In 1643, north of what would be later known as Castle Point, Van Putten built a house and a brewery, North Americas first. In series of Indian and Dutch raids and reprisals, Van Putten was killed and his buildings destroyed, and all residents of Pavonia (as the colony was known) were ordered back to New Amsterdam. Deteriorating relations with the Lenape, its isolation as an island, or relatively long distance from New Amsterdam may have discouraged more settlement. In 1664, the English took possession of  New Amsterdam  with little or no resistance, and in 1668 they confirmed a previous land patent of by Nicolas Verlett. In 1674-75 the area became part of  East Jersey , and he province was divided into four administrative districts, Hoboken becoming part of  Bergen County , where it remained until the creation of Hudson on  February 22 ,  1840 . English-speaking settlers (some relocating from New England) interspersed with the Dutch, but it remained scarcely populated and agrarian. Eventually, the land came into the possession of  William Bayard , who originally supported the revolutionary cause, but became a  Loyalist Tory  after the fall of New York in 1776 when the city and surrounding areas, including the west bank of the re-named Hudson River, were occupied by the British. At the end of the  Revolutionary War , Bayards property was confiscated by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey. In 1784, the land described as ""William Bayard's farm at Hoebuck"" was bought at auction by Colonel  John Stevens  for 18,360 pounds sterling.     [ edit ]   The 19th century          Ferry slips at Terminal              The  Hudson River  during the 1880s, offshore from Hoboken and  Jersey City .       In the early 1800s, Colonel  John Stevens  developed the waterfront as a resort for Manhattanites, a lucrative source of income, which he may have used for testing his many mechanical  inventions . On October 11, 1811 Stevens' ship the  Juliana , began operation as the world's first  steam -powered  ferry  with service between Manhattan and Hoboken. In 1825, he designed and built a  steam locomotive  capable of hauling several passenger cars at his estate. In 1832,  Sybil's Cave  opened as an attraction serving spring water, and after 1841 became a legend, when  Edgar Allan Poe  wrote "" The Mystery of Marie Roget "" about an event that took place there. (In the late 1880s, when the water was found to be contaminated, it was shut and in the 1930s, filled with concrete.) Before his death in 1838, Stevens founded  The Hoboken Land Improvement Company , which during the mid- and late-19th century was managed by his heirs and laid out a regular system of streets, blocks and lots, constructed housing, and developed manufacturing sites. In general, the housing consisted of masonry row houses of three to five stories, some of which survive to the present day, as does the street grid. The advantages of Hoboken as a shipping port and industrial center became apparent.   Hoboken was originally formed as a  township  on  April 9 ,  1849 , from portions of  North Bergen Township . As the town grew in population and employment, many of Hoboken's residents saw a need to incorporate as a full-fledged city, and in a referendum held on  March 29 ,  1855 , ratified an Act of the  New Jersey Legislature  signed the previous day, and the City of Hoboken was born. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]  In the subsequent election, Cornelius V. Clickener became  Hoboken's first mayor . On  March 15 ,  1859 , the Township of Weehawken was created from portions of Hoboken and  North Bergen Township . [ 18 ]   In 1870, based on a bequest from  Edwin A. Stevens ,  Stevens Institute of Technology  was founded at  Castle Point , site of the Stevens family's former estate. By the late 1800s, great shipping lines were using Hoboken as a terminal port, and the  Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad  (later the  Erie Lackawanna Railroad ] developed a railroad terminal at the waterfront. It was also during this time that  German   immigrants , who had been settling in town during most of the century, became the predominant population group in the city, at least partially due to its being a major destination port of the  Hamburg America Line . In addition to the primary industry of shipbuilding, Hoboken became home to  Keuffel and Esser 's three-story factory and in 1884, to  Tietjan and Lang Drydock  (later Todd Shipyards). Well-known companies that developed a major presence in Hoboken after the turn-of the-century included  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea , and  Hostess .     [ edit ]   Birthplace of baseball          Early baseball game played at  Elysian Fields , Hoboken (Currier & Ives lithograph).       The first officially recorded game of  baseball  in US history took place in Hoboken in 1846  [ 20 ]  between  Knickerbocker Club  and  New York Nine  at  Elysian Fields .   In 1845, the  Knickerbocker Club , which had been founded by Alexander Cartwright, began using  Elysian Fields  to play  baseball  due to the lack of suitable grounds on  Manhattan . [ 21 ]  Team members included players of the St George's Cricket Club, the brothers Harry and George Wright, and Henry Chadwick, the English-born journalist who coined the term ""America's Pastime"".   By the 1850s, several  Manhattan -based members of the  National Association of Base Ball Players  were using the grounds as their home field while St George's continued to organize international matches between Canada, England and the United States at the same venue. In 1859, Jack Parr's All England Eleven of professional cricketers played the United States XXII at Hoboken, easily defeating the local competition. Sam Wright and his sons Harry and George Wright played on the defeated United States team-a loss which inadvertently encouraged local players to take up baseball. Henry Chadwick believed that baseball and not cricket should become America's pastime after the game drawing the conclusion that amateur American players did not have the leisure time required to develop cricket skills to the high technical level required of professional players. Harry and George Wright then became two of America's first professional baseball players when Aaron Champion raised funds to found the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869.   In 1865 the grounds hosted a championship match between the  Mutual Club  of  New York  and the  Atlantic Club  of  Brooklyn  that was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured in the  Currier & Ives   lithograph  ""The American National Game of Base Ball"".   With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences in  Brooklyn , enabling promoters there to charge admission to games, the prominence of  Elysian Fields  diminished. In 1868 the leading  Manhattan  club,  Mutual , shifted its home games to the  Union Grounds  in  Brooklyn . In 1880, the founders of the  New York Metropolitans  and  New York Giants  finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan that became known as the  Polo Grounds .     [ edit ]   ""Heaven, Hell or Hoboken""   When the USA decided to enter World War I the  Hamburg-American Line  piers in Hoboken (and New Orleans) were taken under  eminent domain . Federal control of the port and anti-German sentiment led to part of the city being placed under martial law, and many Germans were forcibly moved to  Ellis Island  or left the city altogether. Hoboken became the major point of embarkation and more than three million soldiers, known as "" doughboys "", passed through the city. Their hope for an early return led to  General Pershing 's slogan, "" Heaven ,  Hell  or Hoboken... by  Christmas .""     [ edit ]   Interwar years   Following the war,  Italians , mostly stemming from the  Adriatic  port city of  Molfetta , became the city's major ethnic group, with the  Irish  also having a strong presence. While the city experienced the Depression, jobs in the ships yards and factories were still available, and the ""tenements"" were full. Middle-European Jews, mostly German-speaking, also made their way to the city and established small businesses. The  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  was established on  April 30 ,  1921 . The  Holland Tunnel  was completed in 1927 and the  Lincoln Tunnel  in (1937), allowing for easier vehicular travel between New Jersey and  New York City , bypassing the waterfront.     [ edit ]   Post-World War II   The war provided a shot in the arm for Hoboken as the many industries located in the city were crucial to the war effort. As men went off to battle, more women were hired in the factories, some (most notably,  Todd Shipyards ), offering classes and other incentives to them. Though some returning service men took advantage of GI housing bills, many with strong ethnic and familial ties chose to stay in town. During the fifties, the economy was still driven by  Todd Shipyards ,  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea ,  Hostess  and  Bethlehem Steel  and companies with big plants still not inclined to invest in huge infrastructure elsewhere. Unions were powerful and the pay was good.   By the sixties, though, things began to disintegrate: turn-of-the century housing started to look shabby and feel crowded, shipbuilding was cheaper overseas, and single-story plants surrounded by parking lots made manufacturing and distribution more economical than old brick buildings on congested urban streets. The city appeared to be in the throes of inexorable decline as industries sought (what had been) greener pastures, port operations shifted to larger facilities on  Newark Bay , and the car, truck and plane displaced the railroad and ship as the transportation modes of choice in the United States. Many Hobokenites headed to the suburbs, often the close-by ones in  Bergen  and  Passaic  Counties, and real-estate values declined. Hoboken sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a rundown condition and was often included in lists with other New Jersey cities experiencing the same phenomenon, such as  Paterson ,  Elizabeth ,  Camden , and neighboring  Jersey City .   The old economic underpinnings were gone and nothing new seemed to be on the horizon. Attempts were made to stabilize the population by demolishing the so-called slums along River Street and build subsidized middle-income housing at Marineview Plaza, and in midtown, at Church Towers. Heaps of long uncollected garbage and roving packs of semi-wild dogs were not uncommon sights. [ 22 ]  Though the city had seen better days, Hoboken was never abandoned. New infusions of immigrants, most notably  Puerto Ricans , kept the storefronts open with small businesses and housing stock from being abandoned, but there wasn't much work to be had. Washington Street, commonly called ""the avenue"", was never boarded up, and the tightly-knit neighborhoods remained home to many who were still proud of their city. Stevens stayed a premiere technology school, Maxwell House kept chugging away, and Bethlehem Steel still housed sailors who were dry-docked on its piers. Italian-Americans and other came back to the ""old neighborhood"" to shop for delicatessen. Some streets were ""iffy"", but most were not pulled in at night.     [ edit ]   On the Waterfront   The waterfront defined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from the mid-19th to mid-20th century, by which time it had become essentially industrial (and mostly inaccessible to the general public). The large production plants of  Lipton Tea  and  Maxwell House , and the  drydocks  of  Bethlehem Steel  dominated the northern portion for many years. The southern portion (which had been a US base of the  Hamburg-American Line ) was seized by the federal government under  eminent domain  at outbreak of  World War I , after which it became (with the rest of the Hudson County) a major East Coast cargo-shipping port.  On the Waterfront , consistently listed among the five best American films ever, was shot in Hoboken, dramatically highlighting the rough and tumble lives of  longshoremen  and the infiltration of unions by organized crime.   With the construction of the  interstate highway  system and  containerization  shipping facilities (particularly at  Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal ), the docks became obsolete, and by the 1970s were more or less abandoned. A large swathe of River Street, known as the  Barbary Coast  for its taverns and boarding houses (which had been home for many dockworkers, sailors, merchant marines, and other seamen) was leveled as part of an  urban renewal  project. Though control of the confiscated area had been returned to the city in the 1950s, complex lease agreements with the  Port Authority  gave it little influence on its management. In the 1980s, the waterfront dominated Hoboken politics, with various civic groups and the city government engaging in sometimes nasty, sometimes absurd politics and court cases. By the 1990s, agreements were made with the  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , various levels of government, Hoboken citizens, and private developers to build commercial and residential buildings and ""open spaces"" (mostly along the bulkhead and on the foundation of un-utilized  Pier A ).          Panorama of Manhattan from Pier A.       The northern portion, which had remained in private hands, has also been re-developed. While most of the dry-dock and production facilities were razed to make way for mid-rise apartment houses, many sold as investment ""condos"", some buildings were renovated for adaptive re-use (notably the Tea Building, formerly home to Lipton Tea, and the Machine House, home of the Hoboken Historic Museum). Zoning requires that new construction follow the street grid and limits the height of new construction to retain the architectural character of the city and open sight-lines to the river. Downtown,  Sinatra Park  and  Sinatra Drive  honor the man most consider to be Hoboken's most famous son, while uptown the name Maxwell recalls the factory with its smell of roasting coffee wafting over town and its huge neon ""Good to the Last Drop"" sign, so long a part of the landscape. The midtown section is dominated by the  serpentine rock  outcropping atop of which sits  Stevens Institute of Technology  (which also owns some, as yet, un-developed land on the river). At the foot of the cliff is  Sybil's Cave  (where 19th century day-trippers once came to ""take the waters"" from a natural spring), long sealed shut, though plans for its restoration are in place. The promenade along the river bank is part of the  Hudson River Waterfront Walkway , a state-mandated master plan to connect the municipalities from the  Bayonne Bridge  to  George Washington Bridge  and provide contiguous unhindered access to the water's edge and to create an urban linear park offering expansive views of the Hudson with the spectacular backdrop of the New York skyline.     [ edit ]   Pre- and post-millennium   During the late 1970s and 1980s, the city witnessed a speculation spree, fueled by transplanted New Yorkers and others who bought many turn-of-the-century brownstones in neighborhoods that the still solid middle and working class population had kept intact and by local and out-of-town real-estate investors who bought up late 19th century apartment houses often considered to be tenements. Hoboken experienced a wave of fires, some of which proved to be arson.  Applied Housing , a real-estate investment firm, took advantage of US government incentives to renovate ""sub-standard"" housing and receive subsidized rental payments (commonly know as  Section 8 ), which enabled some low-income, displaced, and disabled residents to move within town. Hoboken attracted artists, musicians, upwardly-mobile commuters (known as yuppies), and ""bohemian types"" interested in the socio-economic possibilities and challenges of a bankrupt New York and who valued the aesthetics of Hoboken's residential, civic and commercial architecture, its sense of community, and relatively (compared to Lower Manhattan) cheaper rents, and quick, train hop away.  Maxwell's  (a live music venue and restaurant) opened and Hoboken became a ""hip"" place to live. Amid this social upheaval, so-called ""newcomers"" displaced some of the ""old-timers"" in the eastern half of the city.   This  gentrification  resembled that of parts of  Brooklyn  and downtown  Jersey City  and Manhattan's  East Village , (and to a lesser degree,  SoHo  and  TriBeCa , which previously had not been residential). The initial presence of artists and young people changed the perception of the place such that others who would not have considered moving there before perceived it as an interesting, safe, exciting, and eventually, desirable. The process continued as many suburbanites, transplanted Americans, internationals, and immigrants (most focused on opportunities in NY/NJ region and proximity to Manhattan) began to make the ""Jersey"" side of the Hudson their home, and the ""real-estate boom"" of the era encouraged many to seek investment opportunities. Empty lots were built on, tenements became condominiums. Hoboken felt the impact of the destruction of the  World Trade Center  intensely, many of its newer residents having worked there. Re-zoning encouraged new construction on former industrial sites on the waterfront and the traditionally more impoverished low-lying west side of the city where, in concert with Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and New Jersey State land-use policy,  transit villages  are now being promoted. Hoboken became, and remains, a focal point in American rediscovery of urban living, and is often used as staging ground for those wishing to move to the New York/New Jersey metropolitan region.     [ edit ]   Government     [ edit ]   Local government          Hoboken City Hall, on Washington Street between First Street and Newark Street.       The City of Hoboken is governed under the  Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council)  system of municipal government by a Mayor and a nine-member City Council. The City Council consists of three members elected at large from the city as a whole, and six members who each represent one of the city's six wards, all of whom are elected to four-year, staggered terms. Candidates run independent of any political party's backing. [ 23 ]   The Mayor of the City of Hoboken is  David Roberts . [ 24 ]  Members of the City Council are: [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     1st Ward:  Theresa Castallano   6th Ward:  Nino Giacchi  (Council President)   At-Large:  Terry LaBruno  (Council Vice-President)   At-Large:  Peter Cammarano   At-Large:  Ruben Ramos Jr.   2nd Ward:  Beth Mason   3rd Ward:  Michael Russo   4th Ward: Dawn Zimmer   5th Ward: Peter Cunningham         [ edit ]   Mayoral election history   During Hoboken's 150 year history as an incorporated city, the elections that have been held for  Mayor of Hoboken  and members of the Hoboken city council have been largely operated by Hoboken's community. Hoboken's political landscape has been shaped by a strong connection between City Hall and the citizens of Hoboken. Many of the people running for mayor / councilman were people who grew up in Hoboken.   Among the most recent elections include:     Thomas Vezzetti  vs. Steve Cappiello (1985; Vezzeti won 6,990 to 6,647)   Patrick Pasculli  vs. Joe Della Fave (1988,1989; Pasculli won)   Anthony Russo  vs. Ira Karasick (1993; Russo won 7,023 to 5,623)   David Roberts  vs.  Anthony Russo  (2001; Roberts won 6,064 to 4,759)   David Roberts  vs. Carol Marsh (2005; Roberts won 5,761 to 4,239.

(February 2008)       On the Street     Hoboken was once known as the city with ""a bar on every corner"" and in fact was once listed in the  Guinness Book of Records  as the city with ""Most bars in a square mile"".

Hoboken limits by law the number of liquor licenses to the number of blocks and the limit is usually reached. Additionally, no license can be moved to within 200 feet (61 m) of another bar or 500 feet (150 m) from a church, which makes it nearly impossible to open a new bar (except in newly renovated perimeter regions of the city).

Despite the economic downturn,  Americans continue to travel. Some may cut back, stay closer to home, and we  all look for deals on dining and accommodations. We probably won't go to Europe, although more international visitors may come  here. Find the adventure near you! See our new transportation page of travel services, news, and deals such as  discount packages between Amtrak & Metro-North trains and Enterprise Rental  Cars. There are plenty of Metro-North one-day getaways such as Dia: Beacon,  Mid-Hudson Children's Museum, and FDR Home & Presidential Library. Read  more about the Dutchess County Farm Fresh Shuttle and Dutchess County Fair Getaways  in this newsletter. There's also a new Personal  Growth webpage for those travelers on inward journeys of self-discovery!                The best assets of New York's  Hudson River Valley are the friendly people, green  landscape and plenty of lakes, streams and rivers close to home. Visiting  historical sites is fun and educational. Re-trace Revolutionary War history and  explore the lives of the industrialists - and women- that built this country.  There are a host of Dutchess County,   New York State and National Parks,  many with no entrance fee. The fine and performing arts are flourishing, in  Beacon, and at Bard and Vassar   Colleges. This summer is  a good time to reacquaint yourselves with the whole host of recreational  resources, less than two hours from the New    York metro area!                Day trips are a great way to spend quality time with family  and friends. Have a picnic or a barbecue at a park or winery. Patronize a superb  area restaurant after sightseeing. Identify something for everyone to do to  keep interest lively for all involved. You can find everything here in your  backyard, just minutes away for your fun and pleasure. Happy trails!                                                                                                                                 See Poughkeepsie in a Whole New Way - the Segway!                     You may have heard of it, and now it's right here in Poughkeepsie!  ""It"" is a Personal Transporter (PT), also know as a Segway. After  less than 30 minutes of training, you, too, can sway calmly along the scenic shores  of the Hudson River on a noiseless, ""green""  PT.                      Segway of the Hudson  Valley has come to this area,  specifically to Dooley Square  at the end of Main Street  in Poughkeepsie,  near the train station. It's a family affair, run by president Jack White, with  Jason White, his son, as the vice president. It's two doors down from Amici's;  look for other motorized carts on display, including a golf cart.                     In addition to the touring possibilities, it is a really fun  activity! The Whites provide calm, confidence-building, step by step  instruction. The PT responds immediately to your body's gentle bending and  leaning. Once you find your balance and center your feet on the footpads, it's  easy to move forward. Next you'll learn how to start and stop, and then after a  few tries with assistance, you learn how to get on and off by yourself. Now you  are ready to try on your own! It has been compared to skiing or snowboarding. It  feels natural, safe, and instinctive, not hard at all - and besides, you are wearing a helmet!                      Recently, I went with a group that navigated a section of  the ordinarily two-and-a half-hour tour that winds along the Hudson River from Waryas Park,  past the Mid-Hudson Children's Museum and the Community Boathouse, all the way  to Marist College. The tour is six miles long; it  was the first one New York   State authorized. Next  time I go, I'll see if it's like riding a bicycle; hopefully, I won't have  forgotten!                     How far can you go? The PT is powered by two lithium-ion  batteries that charge in eight to10 hours. How is it compared to driving? The  PT goes up to 24 miles on 10 cents worth of electricity.                     How far you can actually travel depends on the topography  and your speed, which gets up to 12 miles per hour. I felt comfortable going  around 6 mph. According to their website, the EPA estimates that Americans take  900 million car journeys every day, but half the trips are less than five miles  long and are by solo drivers. The PT is 11 times more energy efficient than a car,  and it's 17 times more energy efficient than an SUV - and produces no  emissions, of course. It does however, draw interested looks and shouts from  those debarking from the train! Most comments are along the lines of, ""boy,  does that look like fun !""- and they would be right!                      Try it - you get a sense of power and speed, yet you also  feel safe and in total control. It feels natural, safe, and instinctive. A guided  Segway tour runs $65 for an hour-and-a half to two-hour tour. They can  accommodate small groups as well as corporate events. PTs costs about $5,200,  and you don't need a license (or to register it) to operate one!  Call 845-485-7349 or visit                        www.SegwayoftheHudsonValley.com   .

Wilderstein’s 2008 Exhibit: “Art Of, For & By Women”                   Have you ever wondered what makes a woman of independent  means tick? Especially Hudson   Valley women of  distinction whose “country lives” have been captured in literature and lore  through the centuries?                   Wilderstein Historic Site in Rhinebeck's 2008 special  exhibition, “Art Of, For & By Women” brings to life the social, cultural  and economic contributions the women of Wilderstein have made, and their  profound impact on Hudson   Valley history. Many of  the featured pieces are on display for the first time ever.                   Three generations of the Suckley family called Wilderstein  home. The last person to reside there was Margaret (Daisy) Suckley, whose  extraordinarily close relationship with Franklin Delano Roosevelt has been  well-chronicled.                   The women in this exhibition represent 200 years, from the  1697 Beekman Patent to the death of Margaret Suckley in 1991. Their stories are  told through paintings, drawings, needlework and silver. Generations of women  brought land, money and social connections as part of their dowries. Land  descending through the female line began when Catherine Beekman and her sister  Cornelia inherited the Beekman Patent. The archives reveal, through letters,  diaries, maps and business papers, that women were active partners in family  enterprises, often controlling partners. In the frequent absence of their  husbands, they not only managed the family and estate, but also business  ventures.                    They were educated, intelligent and insightful. Their  concern for family, community and country and their ability to earn outside  income attests to their independence and resourcefulness.                    Margaret Suckley exemplified the role generations of women  played. She reached beyond the expectations of women of her social standing. She  attended Bryn Mawr  College and was a nurse’s aide in New York during World  War I. It was Margaret who Sara Delano Roosevelt called when her polio-stricken  son needed suitable company. For the rest of his life, FDR relied upon her for  support, as a trusted friend and confidante.                   The estate, with its Queen Anne mansion and Calvert Vaux  designed landscape, is an important examples of Victorian architecture. Listed  on the National Register of Historic Places, this property is a major feature  of the Hudson River National Landmark District and a designated site on the New  York State Women’s Heritage Trail.                   This exhibition runs til October 31, Thursdays through Sundays,  from noon until 4pm.  Wilderstein  Historic Site is located at 330    Morton Road, Rhinebeck.  For more information, call 845-876-4818 or  visit                      www.wilderstein.org                   .

Bard Music Festival: “Prokofiev & His World”                   A dedication to Sergey Prokofiev characterizes the Bard  Music Festival this summer.  Featuring 11  programs over two weekends, “Prokofiev and His World” rounds out the last two  weeks of Bard SummerScape ‘08. A Russian composer, Prokofiev is honored through  chamber, orchestra, and choral performances; as well as pre-concert talks,  panel discussions, scholarly writings, and a symposium. The programs are the  weekends of August 8-10th and August 15-17th, with an  autumn finale October 24th and 25th.                    Prokofiev lived from 1891-1953 and is known as a huge  contributor to 20th century music. His most famous works include Peter  and the Wolf and a ballet of Romeo & Juliet. Educated in Russia, he lived and worked in France and the United   States, but returned to Russia during the 1930s. “Prokofiev  and His World” offers an opportunity to reassess and rediscover a composer of  remarkable range and striking originality, charting a thrilling creative  journey from Prokofiev's early years in St. Petersburg to the dazzling art  scene of 1920s Paris, and back to a Russia increasingly transformed by  totalitarianism.                   The programs focus on Prokofiev’s life and compositions,  highlighting his film music, the effect of religion on music, and how  dictatorships impact art. Film screenings and performances are also scheduled.                    Weekend One (August 8–10), themed ""From East to  West,"" opens on Friday at 7:30 pm with a pre-concert talk by Leon  Botstein, followed by an all-Prokofiev program by the Chiara String Quartet  with several guest artists, including pianist Jeremy Denk, a faculty member of  The Bard College Conservatory of Music, and members of the American Symphony  Orchestra. The weekend closes with a family-friendly concert: ""The Cult of  the Child,"" a late-afternoon program in which Prokofiev's Peter and the  Wolf and Poulenc's Babar are joined by Ravel's ""Mother  Goose"" Suite, Satie's Gymnopédies, and John Alden Carpenter's Krazy  Kat.             Weekend Two (August 15–17), ""The Faustian Pact,"" covers  Prokofiev's world from 1939 onward, opening on Friday, August 15 at 10 am with  the first part of a Symposium led by Jonathan Becker, who will moderate a panel  in a discussion of ""Stalin and Stalinists.""  Part Two begins at  1:30 pm, and the evening's concert, at 8 pm, will present works by Prokofiev,  Rachmaninoff, and Stravinsky, among others. The finale of Weekend Two is a  late-afternoon concert of exoticism – ""20th Century Russia:  Nostalgia and Reality"" – with Prokofiev's Egyptian Nights  contrasted with his Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the  October Revolution, and Epitaph by Vladimir Dukelsky followed by  Rachmaninoff's Three Russian Songs.             Weekend Three (October 24-25) explores ""Prokofiev in America and  Russia,"" with a pre-concert talk by scholar Christopher H. Gibbs and a  performance by the American Symphony Orchestra featuring Prokofiev's Waltz  Suite, the March and Scherzo from The  Love for Three Oranges, his monumental Symphony No. 5, along with John  Alden Carpenter's rarely performed Violin Concerto. The next day offers a panel  discussion on ""Art and Dictatorship"" and an afternoon concert of  music by Prokofiev and Stravinsky, performed by faculty and students of The  Bard College Conservatory of Music.

Restoring and transforming the 120-year old national historic treasure has been in the works since 1992. Construction has begun and is slated for completion in September 2009. The projected opening serves as the main attraction of the Quadricentennial., New York State’s 400th Anniversary Celebration of Henry Hudson’s initial voyage up the his river.                    When built in 1888, it stood alone as the longest bridge in the world, at 6,767 feet. It was a feat unrivalled in its day, providing, at the height of the Industrial Revolution, a connection between western coal and wheat supplies and eastern markets. During World War II, 3,500 rail cars passed over the structure daily, moving wartime personnel and materials to eastern ports. In 1974, the railroad’s usage was unexpectedly shortened when a fire destroyed 700 feet of rail. The steel structure sat unused for more than a decade, until potential to give new life to this old bridge came about with the plans of a walkway.                    The finished Walkway will feature a 1.25 mile long path, with separate sections for walkers, joggers and cyclists. Plans call for light fixtures, benches and shaded areas. Sightseers can enjoy a panoramic view of the Catskill Mountains, while standing 212 feet over the Hudson River. Yes, you'll be looking down onto the nearby Mid-Hudson Bridge! The Walkway is projected to draw 267,000 visitors to the area annually.                    Fred Schaeffer, Walkway Over the Hudson president, recently commented on current progress.                     “Three weeks ago, the firm removing the old deck completed their work. They were two weeks ahead of schedule.  Right after that Harrison & Burrows Bridge Construction, our general contractor, took over the site and prepared it for the next phase—installing the new deck"", stated Schaeffer.”  See                     www.walkway.org                                                                                               Big Attractions Bring Big Press to Dutchess County                    Dutchess   County was highlighted in  two feature articles this month in well-known, reputable magazines.   Town and Country Travel  and  Small  Market Meetings  both included articles on what to do, where to stay and  where to eat in throughout the county.                    Town and Country Travel ’s  article, ""A River Runs Through It', paints a picturesque landscape of the Hudson Valley  in the fall months.

Long known as a  suburb  or  satellite city  of Seattle, [ 3 ]  it is now categorized as an  edge city  or a  boomburb . [ 4 ]  The population was 109,569 at the  2000 census , but by 2006 had grown to an estimated 118,186. [ 5 ]  Bellevue residents are known as Bellevueites.   Downtown Bellevue is undergoing rapid change. It is currently the second largest city center in Washington state with over 35,000 employees and 5,000 residents. [ 6 ]  Based on  per capita income , Bellevue is the 15th wealthiest of 522 communities in the state of Washington. [ 7 ]  Bellevue was recently named number 1 in CNNMoney's list of the best places to live and launch businesses.

Prior to the opening of the  Lake Washington Floating Bridge  in 1940, Bellevue was a rural area with little development. Once the bridge opened, access from  Seattle  improved, and the area gradually grew into a  bedroom community . [ 9 ]          Bellevue seen from Meydenbauer Bay in 1902       Following the 1963 opening of a second bridge across the lake, the  Evergreen Point Floating Bridge , the city began to grow more rapidly. It has since become one of the largest cities in the state, with several high-rise structures in its core and a burgeoning business community. [ 9 ]   Reflective of Bellevue's growth over the years is  Bellevue Square , now one of the largest  shopping centers  in the region. Opened in 1946, [ 9 ]  Bellevue Square underwent a significant expansion in the 1980s. More recently, an expansion to Bellevue Square along Bellevue Way called ""The Lodge"" and the new  One Lincoln Tower  promise to strengthen downtown Bellevue's role as the largest Seattle Eastside shopping and dining destination. The Bravern, a large mixed-use project currently under construction, will feature a  Neiman Marcus  (the first in the Pacific Northwest), along with an assortment of upscale stores.   The city's long-term plans include the Bel-Red Corridor Project, a large-scale planning effort to encourage the redevelopment of a large northern section of the city bordering the adjacent town of  Redmond . [ 10 ]  Patterned after what many civic leaders consider the successful redevelopment of the downtown core, early plans include ""superblock"" mixed use projects similar to  Lincoln Square . Premised on the eventual approval of the extension of light-rail to the Eastside, the city hopes to mitigate transportation problems impeding earlier efforts in redeveloping the downtown core; viewed as an economic development opportunity by many in the business and building development community, the process has focused on infrastructure and the encouragement of private construction in a large-scale urban renewal effort.

[ 11 ]   According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 33.9 square miles (87.8 km), of which, 30.8 square miles (79.6 km) of it is land and 3.2 square miles (8.2 km) of it (9.29%) is water.   The city's name is derived from a  French  term for ""beautiful view"". Under favorable weather conditions, scenic vistas of the  Olympic Mountains  and  Cascade Mountains  can be viewed from hilltops (and strategically-positioned high-rise buildings) within the incorporated city.   The city lies between  Lake Washington  to the west and the smaller  Lake Sammamish  to the east. Much of Bellevue is drained by the  Kelsey Creek  watershed, whose source is located in the Larsen and  Phantom Lake   green belt  and whose outlet is near where  Interstate 90  meets Lake Washington's eastern shore. The city is bisected by  Interstate 405  running north-south, and the southern portion is crossed from west to east by Interstate 90. The  State Route 520  freeway roughly delineates the upper reaches of Bellevue.   South of I-90 the citys  Eastgate  neighborhood continues up  Cougar Mountain . To the west of Cougar Mountain, Bellevue includes  Coal Creek  and  Factoria .   Bellevue is bordered by the cities of  Kirkland  to the north and  Redmond  to the northeast along the  Overlake  and  Crossroads   neighborhoods . Across the short  East Channel Bridge , I-90 connects Bellevue to  Mercer Island  to the southwest.  Issaquah  is to the east, down I-90 at the south end of Lake Sammamish. The city is also bordered to the west by the extremely wealthy [ citation needed ]  suburbs of  Medina ,  Clyde Hill ,  Hunts Point  and  Yarrow Point . The south end of Bellevue is bordered by the city of  Renton , and to the southeast, the relatively recently incorporated city of  Newcastle .     [ edit ]   Transportation   Bellevue is the main Eastside hub for both the local transit authority,  King County Metro , and  Sound Transit , the regional transit system. The Bellevue Transit Center, which serves both Metro and Sound buses, is located in the heart of the downtown business district and is connected to Interstate 405 by NE 6th St. and a direct-access  Texas T  HOV ramp. Local buses run into Kirkland, Redmond, Issaquah, Renton, and the University District [ 12 ] ; regional buses go to Bothell, Lynnwood, Everett, Seattle, Renton, Kent, Auburn and Federal Way, among other cities. [ 13 ]   The  East Link  light rail line is planned to run from Seattle through Mercer Island and Bellevue before ending in Redmond. A measure including this and other regional road and transit projects went before voters on November 4, 2008 and was approved. However, the financial uncertainty of the area's other numerous transportation projects reflect the political fragmentation of the Puget Sound area. What is becoming apparent are the increasing costs associated with the central Puget Sound's regional transportation infrastructure. [ 14 ]   The City of Bellevue has undertaken an extensive ""Bel-Red Area Transformation"" process which seeks to plan some 900 acres (3.6 km 2 ) in the northern portion of the city [ 15 ] , all of which is premised on the extension of light rail to the Eastside under Sound Transit 2. [ 16 ]  The top-down and highly integrated land use and transportation planning is similar to earlier planning for the Downtown.   Bellevue is also served by a  railroad , a  Burlington Northern  branch line known as the  Woodinville Subdivision , which includes the historic  Wilburton Trestle . This local freight line is the subject of a controversial plan by King County to remove the rails and replace them with a  bicycle  trail. In response, a  grass roots  movement has sprung up to both save the railroad and begin a rail transit service on it as an alternative to the heavily congested I-405 freeway, which runs roughly parallel to it. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   Government and politics          Bellevue City Hall       Bellevue has a Council-Manager form of government with seven, non-partisan council members elected at large for staggered four-year terms. [ 18 ]  The City Council selects a Mayor from among its members, who serves as council chair but has no veto power. As of 2006, the mayor is Grant Degginger and the city's manager is Steve Sarkozy. [ citation needed ]   The position of Mayor is largely ceremonial in Bellevue as the City Manager runs the City's day-to-day operations. The mayor runs council meetings, helps choose the issues that get on the council's meeting agendas, and serves as the city's most visible spokesperson. The position of Mayor is part-time. In practice, operational authority is held by the City Manager, the position that supervises an employee/consultant form of municipal authority. Indeed, more consideration is given the selection of City Manager than many candidates for City Council, the position of Mayor elected not by popular vote but by the seven members of Council.   In the  2004 U.S. presidential election , Bellevue residents cast 57.10% of their votes for  Democrat   John Kerry . [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Education       Main article:  Bellevue School District       Bellevue is home to  Bellevue Community College  (BCC) and  City University . The highly rated [ citation needed ]  BCC is the largest [ citation needed ]  community college in Washington and the third largest institution of higher education in the state [ citation needed ] .   The city hosts the  Bellevue School District . There are four main public  high schools  -  Bellevue High School ,  Interlake High School ,  Newport High School , and  Sammamish High School , as well as two alternative high schools,  International School  and Robinswood High School.   At the elementary level, Bellevue is home to the Eastside's only  Waldorf Education , at Three Cedars School, and to several  Montessori  schools [ citation needed ] .     [ edit ]   Economy   With its immediate proximity to  Redmond , home of  Microsoft , and direct highway access to  Seattle  via  Interstate 90  and  State Route 520 , Bellevue is now home to the headquarters of many small and large businesses. Many of these are technology companies, most started in the 1990s. The city has numerous thriving commercial districts. It also immediately borders the tiny but extremely affluent [ citation needed ]   Lake Washington  Gold Coast [ citation needed ] [ clarification needed ]  district ( Medina ,  Hunts Point ,  Clyde Hill , and  Yarrow Point ), whose residents include  Bill Gates  and control a large portion of the local wealth [ citation needed ] .

On the same subject, the  Bellevue Police Department  is strongly supported by the community. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Culture   Bellevue is the site of the popular annual  Bellevue Arts and Crafts Fair  (originally Pacific Northwest Arts and Crafts Fair), held since 1947 at the end of July.          Bellevue Arts Museum       The  Bellevue Arts Museum  first opened in 1975, then moved to Bellevue Square in 1983. In 2001 the museum moved into its own building, designed by  Steven Holl . The museum subsequently ran into financial difficulties and was forced to close to the public in 2003. After a lengthy fundraising campaign, a remodel, and a new mission to become a national centre for the fine art of craft and design, the museum re-opened on June 18, 2005 with an exhibition of teapots. [ 24 ]   The Rosalie Whyel Museum of Doll Art contains one of the largest doll collections in the worldmore than a thousand dollsdisplayed on two floors of a Victorian-style building.

The  Unisphere  located in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park has become a symbol for Queens County.       Flushing , founded in 1645, is a neighborhood in the north central part of the City of  New York   borough  of  Queens , ten miles (16 km) east of  Manhattan .   Flushing was one of the first Dutch settlements on Long Island. Today, it is one of the largest and most diverse neighborhoods in New York City and has expanded well beyond its original boundaries. Flushing's diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside here including people of European, Asian, Hispanic and African-American descent. It is part of the  Fifth Congressional District , which encompasses the entire northeastern shore of Queens County, and extends into neighboring  Nassau County . Flushing is serviced by five railroad stations on the  Long Island Rail Road   Port Washington Branch  and the  New York City Subway   Number 7 subway line  has its terminus at Main Street.   Flushing is part of  Queens Community Board 7 [ 1 ]  and is bounded by Flushing Meadows-Corona Park to the West,  Francis Lewis Boulevard  to the East, Union Turnpike to the South and Willets Point Boulevard to the North.

The village was named after the city of  Vlissingen , in the southwestern  Netherlands , the main port of the company.   In its early days, the village of Flushing was inhabited by English colonists, among them a farmer named  John Bowne . John Bowne defied a prohibition imposed by New Amsterdam Director-General  Peter Stuyvesant  on harboring Quakers by allowing  Quaker  meetings in his home. Today, landmarks from the Dutch period in Flushing include the  John Bowne House  on Bowne Street and the  Old Quaker Meeting House  on  Northern Boulevard .   The  Flushing Remonstrance , signed in Flushing on December 27, 1657, protested religious persecution and eventually led to the decision by the Dutch West India Company to allow Quakers and others to worship freely. As such, Flushing is claimed to be a birthplace of religious freedom in the new world.  [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   English colonial history   In 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, ending Dutch control of the colony, and renamed it New York. Flushing remained a small Long Island village.   Flushing was the site of the first commercial  tree nurseries  in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. Much of the northern section of  Kissena Park , former site of the Parsons nursery, still contains a wide variety of exotic trees. The naming of streets intersecting Kissena Boulevard on its way toward Kissena Park celebrates this fact (Ash Avenue, Beech, Cherry ...Poplar, Quince, Rose). Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward project, now known as  Central Park  in Manhattan.   During the American Revolution, Flushing, along with most settlements in present-day Queens County, favored the British and quartered British troops. Following the  Battle of Long Island ,  Nathan Hale , an officer in the  Continental Army , was apprehended near Flushing Bay while on what was probably an intelligence gathering mission and was later hanged.   The 1785  Kingsland Homestead , originally the residence of a wealthy  Quaker  merchant, now serves as the home of the  Queens Historical Society . [ 3 ]   The 1790 United States census recorded that 5,393 people lived in what is present-day Queens County.     [ edit ]   Nineteenth century   During the 1800s, as New York City continued to grow in population and economic strength, Flushing's proximity to Manhattan was critical to its growth and transformation to a fashionable residential area.          Map of Flushing in 1891.       In 1813, the village of Flushing was incorporated into the Town of Flushing. By the mid-1860s, Queens County had 30,429 residents. Flushing's expansion continued in 1867 and 1868 when the neighboring villages of College Point and Whitestone were incorporated into the Town of Flushing.   In 1898, although opposed to the proposal, Flushing along with a re-drawn Queens County was consolidated into the City of New York. Local farmland continued to be subdivided and developed transforming Flushing into a densely populated neighborhood of New York City.     [ edit ]   Twentieth century and World's Fairs   The continued construction of bridges over the Flushing River and the development of other roads increased the volume of vehicular traffic into Flushing. In 1909, the construction of the  Queensborough Bridge  over the  East River  connected Queens County to  midtown Manhattan .   The introduction of rail road service to Manhattan in 1910 by the  Long Island Rail Road  Port Washington Branch and in 1928 by the  New York City Transit Authority  Number 7 subway line hastened the continued transformation of Flushing to a commuter suburb and commercial center. Due to increased traffic, a main roadway through Flushing named Broadway was widened and renamed Northern Boulevard.   Flushing was a forerunner of Hollywood, when the young American film industry was still based on the East Coast and  Chicago . Decades later, the  RKO  Keith's movie palace would host  vaudeville  acts and appearances by the likes of  Mickey Rooney ,  The Marx Brothers  and  Bob Hope . The theater now lies vacant and in disrepair due to an unauthorized real estate development project that took place in the early 1990s.   The  1939-1940 World's Fair  was held in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. [ 4 ]  Massive preparations for the Fair began in 1936 and included the elimination of the Corona dumps. Among the innovations presented to the world in 1939 was the  television , which broadcast a speech by  Franklin D. Roosevelt .   After the World's Fair, the New York City pavilion was converted into the temporary headquarters of the United Nations where, in 1947, the  UN voted  in favor of the establishment of the  State of Israel .   A second World's Fair, the  1964-1965 World's Fair  was also held at the site of the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.  Pope Paul VI  attended the Fair on October 4, 1965. On this papal trip, Pope Paul VI became the first pope to visit the United States. An  exedra  now commemorates the site of the Vatican pavilion.  Michelangelo 's masterpiece, the  Piet , was exhibited during his trip.   Following the Fair, the  Unisphere , the New York State Pavilion and the New York City Pavilion remained in the park. The NYC Pavilion was converted into an ice-skating rink and later, the ice rink became the Queens Museum of Art.     [ edit ]   Landmarks, museums and cultural institutions   There are numerous historic structures located in Flushing.   Flushing Town Hall  [1]  is located on Northern Boulevard and is the headquarters of the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts. It is an affiliate of the  Smithsonian Institution  in Washington, D.C.  [ 5 ]  The building houses a concert hall and cultural center and is one of the sites designated along the Queens Historical Society's Freedom Mile  [2] .   Other registered New York City Landmarks include the  Bowne House ,  Kingsland Homestead ,  Old Quaker Meeting House  (1694),  Flushing High School , St. George's Church (1854), the  Lewis H. Latimer House , the former  RKO  Keith's movie theater, the United States Post Office on Main Street and the  Unisphere , a 12-story high, stainless steel globe that served as the centerpiece for the  1964 New York World's Fair . The Flushing Armory, on Northern Boulevard, was formerly used by the National Guard. Presently, the Queens North Task Force of the  New York City Police Department  uses this building. [ 6 ]  In 2005, the Fitzgerald-Ginsberg Mansion [3]  on Bayside Avenue and in 2007, the Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden  [4]  were designated as landmarks.          Marker of the two time capsules       Several attractions originally developed for the World's Fairs in  Flushing Meadows-Corona Park  are worth visiting. There is a stone marker for the two 5,000-year  Westinghouse Time Capsules  made of special  alloys  buried in the park, chronicling 20th Century life in the United States dedicated both in 1938 and 1965. Also located in the park are the  Queens Museum of Art  which features a scale model of the City of New York, the largest architectural model ever built; Queens Theatre in the Park  [5] ; the  New York Hall of Science  and the  Queens Zoo .   The  Queens Botanical Garden  located on Main Street, has been in operation continuously since its opening as an exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair. The Botanical Garden carries on Flushing's nearly three centuries long horticultural tradition, dating back to its once famed tree nurseries and seed farms.     [ edit ]   Demographics   The 2000 United States Census Bureau ranked Queens County as the ninth most populous county in the United States with over 2.2 million residents. According to the Census Bureau, Queens County experienced over a 14% increase in population since the 1990 census.   The 2000 Census also reflected the growth of the  Asian American  population in Queens County with over 391,500 people identifying themselves as Asian Americans, it has garnered the nickname ""Little Korea"". That number was the largest in New York City, more than twice the number of people identifying themselves as  Asian-American  in Brooklyn. The 2000 Census revealed that the 5th Congressional District had almost 655,000 residents. Approximately 364,200 residents or 55% of the District identified themselves as white. A total of 160,896 residents or 25% of the District identified themselves as Asian Americans and 153,721 or 24% identified themselves as Hispanic.   [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Religion   Flushing is a very religiously diverse community in America (if not the most). There are ""over 200 places of worship in a small urban neighborhood about 2.5 square miles [6.5 square kilometers]."" [ 9 ]  ""Flushing has become a model for religious pluralism in America, says R. Scott Hanson, a visiting assistant professor of history at the State University of New York at Binghamton and an affiliate of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University."" [ 10 ]   In 1657, while Flushing was still a Dutch settlement, a document known as the  Flushing Remonstrance  was created by Edward Hart, the town clerk, where some thirty ordinary citizens protested a ban imposed by Peter Stuyvesant, the director general of New Amsterdam, forbidding the harboring of Quakers. The Flushing Remonstrance cited the Flushing Town charter of 1645 which promised liberty of conscience. [ 11 ]   Today, Flushing abounds in houses of worship, ranging from the Dutch colonial epoch Quaker Meeting House, St. George's Episcopal Church, the Free Synagogue of Flushing, St. Mel Roman Catholic Church, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - the largest Greek Orthodox Church in the United States. The New York Times     [ edit ]   Ethnic culture          Roosevelt Avenue is one of the main commercial streets in Flushing.       The intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, the business center for Flushing located at the terminus of the Number 7 subway line on the westernmost edge of the neighborhood has a concentration of Chinese and Korean small businesses among others. Today, this area is also known for its selection of authentic Chinese, Korean and Asian restaurants.   Other areas of Flushing continue to maintain a large Italian and Greek presence reflected in the many Italian and Greek bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants in the northern and eastern sections of the neighborhood.   An area south of Franklin Avenue is home to an Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi market. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Neighborhoods   Broadway-Flushing , also known as North Flushing, is a residential area with many large homes. Part of this area has been designated a State and Federal historic district due to the elegant, park-like character of the neighborhood. Recently much of the area was rezoned by the City of New York to preserve the low density, residential quality of the area. The neighborhood awaits designation as an Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Broadway-Flushing is bounded by 29 th  Avenue to the north, Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue to the south, 155 st  to the west and 172 nd  Streets to the east.

For Queens County, the Department of Parks and Recreation is headquartered at The Overlook in Forest Park located in Kew Gardens.     Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , a 1,255-acre (5.08 km 2 ) park, is considered a flagship park in Queens. The site hosted two World's Fairs, the first in 1939-1940 and the second in 1964-1965. As the result, the park infrastructure reflects the construction undertaken for the Fairs. Also located here is Citi Field and the National Tennis Center which is the home of the US Tennis Open. In 2008, a new Aquatic Center was opened in the park [6] .       Kissena Park  is a 234-acre (0.95 km 2 ) park with a lake as a centerpiece.

Today, it is one of the largest and most diverse neighborhoods in New York City and has expanded well beyond its original boundaries. Flushing's diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside here including people of European, Asian, Hispanic and African-American descent. It is part of the  Fifth Congressional District , which encompasses the entire northeastern shore of Queens County, and extends into neighboring  Nassau County . Flushing is serviced by five railroad stations on the  Long Island Rail Road   Port Washington Branch  and the  New York City Subway   Number 7 subway line  has its terminus at Main Street.   Flushing is part of  Queens Community Board 7 [ 1 ]  and is bounded by Flushing Meadows-Corona Park to the West,  Francis Lewis Boulevard  to the East, Union Turnpike to the South and Willets Point Boulevard to the North.

The village was named after the city of  Vlissingen , in the southwestern  Netherlands , the main port of the company.   In its early days, the village of Flushing was inhabited by English colonists, among them a farmer named  John Bowne . John Bowne defied a prohibition imposed by New Amsterdam Director-General  Peter Stuyvesant  on harboring Quakers by allowing  Quaker  meetings in his home. Today, landmarks from the Dutch period in Flushing include the  John Bowne House  on Bowne Street and the  Old Quaker Meeting House  on  Northern Boulevard .   The  Flushing Remonstrance , signed in Flushing on December 27, 1657, protested religious persecution and eventually led to the decision by the Dutch West India Company to allow Quakers and others to worship freely. As such, Flushing is claimed to be a birthplace of religious freedom in the new world.  [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   English colonial history   In 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, ending Dutch control of the colony, and renamed it New York. Flushing remained a small Long Island village.   Flushing was the site of the first commercial  tree nurseries  in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. Much of the northern section of  Kissena Park , former site of the Parsons nursery, still contains a wide variety of exotic trees. The naming of streets intersecting Kissena Boulevard on its way toward Kissena Park celebrates this fact (Ash Avenue, Beech, Cherry ...Poplar, Quince, Rose). Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward project, now known as  Central Park  in Manhattan.   During the American Revolution, Flushing, along with most settlements in present-day Queens County, favored the British and quartered British troops. Following the  Battle of Long Island ,  Nathan Hale , an officer in the  Continental Army , was apprehended near Flushing Bay while on what was probably an intelligence gathering mission and was later hanged.   The 1785  Kingsland Homestead , originally the residence of a wealthy  Quaker  merchant, now serves as the home of the  Queens Historical Society . [ 3 ]   The 1790 United States census recorded that 5,393 people lived in what is present-day Queens County.     [ edit ]   Nineteenth century   During the 1800s, as New York City continued to grow in population and economic strength, Flushing's proximity to Manhattan was critical to its growth and transformation to a fashionable residential area.          Map of Flushing in 1891.       In 1813, the village of Flushing was incorporated into the Town of Flushing. By the mid-1860s, Queens County had 30,429 residents. Flushing's expansion continued in 1867 and 1868 when the neighboring villages of College Point and Whitestone were incorporated into the Town of Flushing.   In 1898, although opposed to the proposal, Flushing along with a re-drawn Queens County was consolidated into the City of New York. Local farmland continued to be subdivided and developed transforming Flushing into a densely populated neighborhood of New York City.     [ edit ]   Twentieth century and World's Fairs   The continued construction of bridges over the Flushing River and the development of other roads increased the volume of vehicular traffic into Flushing. In 1909, the construction of the  Queensborough Bridge  over the  East River  connected Queens County to  midtown Manhattan .   The introduction of rail road service to Manhattan in 1910 by the  Long Island Rail Road  Port Washington Branch and in 1928 by the  New York City Transit Authority  Number 7 subway line hastened the continued transformation of Flushing to a commuter suburb and commercial center. Due to increased traffic, a main roadway through Flushing named Broadway was widened and renamed Northern Boulevard.   Flushing was a forerunner of Hollywood, when the young American film industry was still based on the East Coast and  Chicago . Decades later, the  RKO  Keith's movie palace would host  vaudeville  acts and appearances by the likes of  Mickey Rooney ,  The Marx Brothers  and  Bob Hope . The theater now lies vacant and in disrepair due to an unauthorized real estate development project that took place in the early 1990s.   The  1939-1940 World's Fair  was held in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. [ 4 ]  Massive preparations for the Fair began in 1936 and included the elimination of the Corona dumps. Among the innovations presented to the world in 1939 was the  television , which broadcast a speech by  Franklin D. Roosevelt .   After the World's Fair, the New York City pavilion was converted into the temporary headquarters of the United Nations where, in 1947, the  UN voted  in favor of the establishment of the  State of Israel .   A second World's Fair, the  1964-1965 World's Fair  was also held at the site of the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.  Pope Paul VI  attended the Fair on October 4, 1965. On this papal trip, Pope Paul VI became the first pope to visit the United States. An  exedra  now commemorates the site of the Vatican pavilion.  Michelangelo 's masterpiece, the  Piet , was exhibited during his trip.   Following the Fair, the  Unisphere , the New York State Pavilion and the New York City Pavilion remained in the park. The NYC Pavilion was converted into an ice-skating rink and later, the ice rink became the Queens Museum of Art.     [ edit ]   Landmarks, museums and cultural institutions   There are numerous historic structures located in Flushing.   Flushing Town Hall  [1]  is located on Northern Boulevard and is the headquarters of the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts. It is an affiliate of the  Smithsonian Institution  in Washington, D.C.  [ 5 ]  The building houses a concert hall and cultural center and is one of the sites designated along the Queens Historical Society's Freedom Mile  [2] .   Other registered New York City Landmarks include the  Bowne House ,  Kingsland Homestead ,  Old Quaker Meeting House  (1694),  Flushing High School , St. George's Church (1854), the  Lewis H. Latimer House , the former  RKO  Keith's movie theater, the United States Post Office on Main Street and the  Unisphere , a 12-story high, stainless steel globe that served as the centerpiece for the  1964 New York World's Fair . The Flushing Armory, on Northern Boulevard, was formerly used by the National Guard. Presently, the Queens North Task Force of the  New York City Police Department  uses this building. [ 6 ]  In 2005, the Fitzgerald-Ginsberg Mansion [3]  on Bayside Avenue and in 2007, the Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden  [4]  were designated as landmarks.          Marker of the two time capsules       Several attractions originally developed for the World's Fairs in  Flushing Meadows-Corona Park  are worth visiting. There is a stone marker for the two 5,000-year  Westinghouse Time Capsules  made of special  alloys  buried in the park, chronicling 20th Century life in the United States dedicated both in 1938 and 1965. Also located in the park are the  Queens Museum of Art  which features a scale model of the City of New York, the largest architectural model ever built; Queens Theatre in the Park  [5] ; the  New York Hall of Science  and the  Queens Zoo .   The  Queens Botanical Garden  located on Main Street, has been in operation continuously since its opening as an exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair. The Botanical Garden carries on Flushing's nearly three centuries long horticultural tradition, dating back to its once famed tree nurseries and seed farms.     [ edit ]   Demographics   The 2000 United States Census Bureau ranked Queens County as the ninth most populous county in the United States with over 2.2 million residents. According to the Census Bureau, Queens County experienced over a 14% increase in population since the 1990 census.   The 2000 Census also reflected the growth of the  Asian American  population in Queens County with over 391,500 people identifying themselves as Asian Americans, it has garnered the nickname ""Little Korea"". That number was the largest in New York City, more than twice the number of people identifying themselves as  Asian-American  in Brooklyn. The 2000 Census revealed that the 5th Congressional District had almost 655,000 residents. Approximately 364,200 residents or 55% of the District identified themselves as white. A total of 160,896 residents or 25% of the District identified themselves as Asian Americans and 153,721 or 24% identified themselves as Hispanic.   [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Religion   Flushing is a very religiously diverse community in America (if not the most). There are ""over 200 places of worship in a small urban neighborhood about 2.5 square miles [6.5 square kilometers]."" [ 9 ]  ""Flushing has become a model for religious pluralism in America, says R. Scott Hanson, a visiting assistant professor of history at the State University of New York at Binghamton and an affiliate of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University."" [ 10 ]   In 1657, while Flushing was still a Dutch settlement, a document known as the  Flushing Remonstrance  was created by Edward Hart, the town clerk, where some thirty ordinary citizens protested a ban imposed by Peter Stuyvesant, the director general of New Amsterdam, forbidding the harboring of Quakers. The Flushing Remonstrance cited the Flushing Town charter of 1645 which promised liberty of conscience. [ 11 ]   Today, Flushing abounds in houses of worship, ranging from the Dutch colonial epoch Quaker Meeting House, St. George's Episcopal Church, the Free Synagogue of Flushing, St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - the largest Greek Orthodox Church in the United States. The New York Times     [ edit ]   Ethnic culture          Roosevelt Avenue is one of the main commercial streets in Flushing.       The intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, the business center for Flushing located at the terminus of the Number 7 subway line on the westernmost edge of the neighborhood has a concentration of Chinese and Korean small businesses among others. Today, this area is also known for its selection of authentic Chinese, Korean and Asian restaurants.   Other areas of Flushing continue to maintain a large Italian and Greek presence reflected in the many Italian and Greek bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants in the northern and eastern sections of the neighborhood.   An area south of Franklin Avenue is home to an Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi market. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Neighborhoods   Broadway-Flushing , also known as North Flushing, is a residential area with many large homes. Part of this area has been designated a State and Federal historic district due to the elegant, park-like character of the neighborhood. Recently much of the area was rezoned by the City of New York to preserve the low density, residential quality of the area. The neighborhood awaits designation as an Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Broadway-Flushing is bounded by 29 th  Avenue to the north, Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue to the south, 155 st  to the west and 172 nd  Streets to the east. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Parks   All the public parks and playgrounds in Flushing are supervised by the  New York City Department of Parks and Recreation . For Queens County, the Department of Parks and Recreation is headquartered at The Overlook in Forest Park located in Kew Gardens.     Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , a 1,255-acre (5.08 km 2 ) park, is considered a flagship park in Queens. The site hosted two World's Fairs, the first in 1939-1940 and the second in 1964-1965. As the result, the park infrastructure reflects the construction undertaken for the Fairs. Also located here is Citi Field and the National Tennis Center which is the home of the US Tennis Open. In 2008, a new Aquatic Center was opened in the park [6] .       Kissena Park  is a 234-acre (0.95 km 2 ) park with a lake as a centerpiece.       Bowne Park is an 11-acre (45,000 m 2 ) park developed on the former estate of New York City Mayor Walter Bowne.       Flushing Fields is a 10-acre (40,000 m 2 ) greenbelt that includes the home athletic field of Flushing High School.       [ edit ]   Education   The public schools in Flushing are all supervised by the New York City Department of Education through Administrative District 25.   There are numerous public Elementary and Junior High Schools in Flushing and students generally attend a school based on the location of their residence.     [ edit ]   Libraries   In 1858, the first library in Queens County was founded in Flushing. Today, there are eight branches of the  Queens Borough Public Library  with Flushing addresses. [ 13 ]  The largest of the Flushing branches is located at the intersection of Kissena Boulevard and Main Street, [ 14 ]  and is the largest branch library in New York City, and the busiest branch of the highest circulation system  [7]  in the country . [ 15 ]  This library has developed into a valuable community resource and houses an auditorium for public events. The current building, designed by Polshek Partnership Architects, is the third to be built on the site--the first was a gift of  Andrew Carnegie .

The  Flushing-Main Street subway station  located at the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue is the eastern terminus of the line. Until the Flushing Number 7 made its way to the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue in 1928, the center of Flushing was considered to be at the intersection of Northern Boulevard and Main Street.     [ edit ]   Railroad service   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority operates the Long Island Rail Road Port Washington Branch that has five rail road stations in Flushing. The  Flushing-Main Street Station  of the  Long Island Rail Road  is located one block away from the subway station that bears the same name. The Long Island Rail Road also has stations at  Shea Stadium ,  Murray Hill ,  Broadway  and  Auburndale . The Long Island Rail Road provides a direct rail link to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.

Shea Stadium  was the home park until the end of the 2008 season. The United States Tennis Association's National Tennis Center hosts the  U.S. Open  Tournament in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park every year. This tournament relocated to Flushing from its original home in Forest Hills, Queens.   Shea Stadium has hosted four  World Series , in 1969, 1973, 1986 and 2000.

Hoboken is also the location of the first recorded  baseball  game in the United States and the  Stevens Institute of Technology , one of the oldest technological universities in the United States.   Hoboken was first settled by the Dutch as part of the  Novo Belgio [ 6 ]  or the  New Netherland  colony in the 17th century. Hoboken was first established as a separate township in 1849 and incorporated as a city in 1855.

Hoboken lies on the west bank of the  Hudson River  across from the  Manhattan ,  New York City  neighborhoods of the  West Village  and  Chelsea  between  Weehawken Cove  and  Union City  at the north and  Jersey City  (the county seat) at the south and west.   According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 5.1 km (2.0 mi). 3.3 km (1.3 mi) of it is land and 1.8 km (0.7 mi) of it is water. The total area is 35.35% water.   Hoboken has 48 streets laid out in a grid, with numbered streets running east-west. Many north-south streets were named for US presidents (Washington, Adams, Madison, Monroe), though Clinton Street likely honors 19th century politician  DeWitt Clinton .   Hoboken's  zip code  is 07030 and its  area code  is  201  with  551   overlaid .

The  population density  is 11,636.5/km (30,239.2/mi), fourth highest in the nation after neighboring communities of  Guttenberg ,  Union City  and  West New York . [ 9 ]  There are 19,915 housing units at an average density of 6,007.2/km (15,610.7/mi). The racial makeup of the city is 80.82%  White , 4.26%  African American , 0.16%  Native American , 4.31%  Asian , 0.05%  Pacific Islander , 7.63% from  other races , and 2.78% from two or more races. Furthermore 20.18% of those residents also consider themselves to be  Hispanic  or  Latino .   There are 19,418 households out of which 11.4% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 23.8% are  married couples  living together, 9.0% have a female householder with no husband present, and 64.8% are non-families. 41.8% of all households are made up of individuals and 8.0% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 1.92 and the average family size is 2.73.   In the city the population is spread out with 10.5% under the age of 18, 15.3% from 18 to 24, 51.7% from 25 to 44, 13.5% from 45 to 64, and 9.0% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 30 years. For every 100 females, age 18 and over, there are 103.9 males.   The median income for a household in the city as of the last census was $62,550, while the median income for a family was $67,500 (these figures had risen to $96,786 and $107,375 respectively as of a 2007 estimate [ 10 ] ). Males had a median income of $54,870 versus $46,826 for females. The  per capita income  for the city was $43,195. 11.0% of the population and 10.0% of families are below the  poverty line . Out of the total population, 23.6% of those under the age of 18 and 20.7% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.   The city is a  bedroom community  of  New York City , where most of its employed residents work. [ 11 ]  Up to 25% of the population (as of 2008) works in finance or real estate. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The name ""Hoboken"" was decided upon by  Colonel John Stevens  when he purchased land, on a part of which the city still sits.          100 block of Washington Street              Newark Street looking west       It's believed that the  Lenape  (later called  Delaware Indian ) referred to the area as the land of the tobacco pipe, most likely to refer to the  soapstone  collected there to carve  tobacco pipes , and used a phrase that became Hopoghan Hackingh. [ 13 ]   The first Europeans to live there were  Dutch / Flemish  settlers to  New Netherlands  or  Novo Belgio [ 14 ] , who may have bastardized the Lenape phrase, though there is no known written documentation to confirm it. It also cannot be confirmed that the American Hoboken is named after the Flemish town  Hoboken , annexed in 1983 to  Antwerp ,  Belgium , [ 15 ]  whose name is derived from Middle Dutch  Hooghe Buechen  or  Hoge Beuken , meaning  High  Beeches  or  Tall Beeches . [ 16 ]  The city has also been cited as having been named after the  Van Hoboken  family of the 17th-century estate in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where there is still a square dedicated to them. It is not known what the area was called in  Jersey Dutch , a Dutch-variant language based on  Zeelandic  and Flemish, with English and possibly Lenape influences, spoken in northern New Jersey during the 18th and 19th centuries.   Like  Weehawken , its neighbor to the north, Communipaw and Harisimus to the south, Hoboken had variations in the folks-tongue of the period.  Hoebuck , old Dutch for high bluff and likely referring to Castle Point, was used during the colonial era and later spelled in English as  Hobuck , [ 17 ]   Hobock , [ 18 ]  and  Hoboocken . [ 19 ]   Hoboken's unofficial nickname is now the ""Mile Square City"", but it actually covers an area of two square miles when including the under-water parts in the Hudson River. During the late 19th/early 20th century the population and culture of Hoboken was dominated by German language speakers who sometimes called it ""Little Bremen"", many of whom are buried in  Hoboken Cemetery, North Bergen .   The term "" hobo "" (i.e., a railroad journeyman) is believed to have stemmed from the groups of hobos traveling by railroad from Hoboken.

Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (January 2009)         [ edit ]   Early and colonial   Hoboken was originally an island, surrounded by the Hudson River on the east and tidal lands at the foot of the  New Jersey Palisades  on the west. It was a seasonal campsite in the territory of the  Hackensack , a sub-group of  Lenni Lenape  called  Unami , whose totem was the turtle. Later called  Delaware Indian , the Lenape are believed to have lived for more than 2800 years on lands around and in-between the Hudson and  Delaware Rivers . The first European to lay claim the area was  Henry Hudson , an Englishman sailing for the  Dutch East India Company , who anchored his ship the  Halve Maen  ( Half Moon ) at  Weehawken Cove  on  October 2 ,  1609 . The United New Netherland Company was created to manage this new territory and in June of 1623,  New Netherland  or  Novo Belgio [ 20 ]  became a Dutch colony. In 1630,  Michael Pauw , a burgemeester (mayor) of  Amsterdam  and a director of the  West India Company , received a land grant as  patroon  on the condition that he would plant a colony of not fewer than fifty persons within four years on the west bank of what had been named the  North River . Three  Lenape  sold the land that is was to become Hoboken (and part of Jersey City) for 80 fathoms (146 m) of  wampum , 20 fathoms (37 m) of cloth, 12 kettles, six guns, two blankets, one double kettle and half a barrel of beer. These transactions, variously dated as July 12, 1630 and November 22, 1630, represent the earliest known conveyance for the area. Pauw (whose Latinized name is  Pavonia ) neglected to settle the land and he was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633. It was later acquired by  Hendrick Van Vorst , who leased part of the land to  Aert Van Putten , a farmer. In 1643, north of what would be later known as Castle Point, Van Putten built a house and a brewery, North Americas first. In series of Indian and Dutch raids and reprisals, Van Putten was killed and his buildings destroyed, and all residents of Pavonia (as the colony was known) were ordered back to New Amsterdam. Deteriorating relations with the Lenape, its isolation as an island, or relatively long distance from New Amsterdam may have discouraged more settlement. In 1664, the English took possession of  New Amsterdam  with little or no resistance, and in 1668 they confirmed a previous land patent of by Nicolas Verlett. In 1674-75 the area became part of  East Jersey , and he province was divided into four administrative districts, Hoboken becoming part of  Bergen County , where it remained until the creation of Hudson on  February 22 ,  1840 . English-speaking settlers (some relocating from New England) interspersed with the Dutch, but it remained scarcely populated and agrarian. Eventually, the land came into the possession of  William Bayard , who originally supported the revolutionary cause, but became a  Loyalist Tory  after the fall of New York in 1776 when the city and surrounding areas, including the west bank of the re-named Hudson River, were occupied by the British. At the end of the  Revolutionary War , Bayards property was confiscated by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey. In 1784, the land described as ""William Bayard's farm at Hoebuck"" was bought at auction by Colonel  John Stevens  for 18,360 pounds sterling.     [ edit ]   The 19th century          Ferry slips at Terminal              The  Hudson River  during the 1880s, offshore from Hoboken and  Jersey City .       In the early 1800s, Colonel  John Stevens  developed the waterfront as a resort for Manhattanites, a lucrative source of income, which he may have used for testing his many mechanical  inventions . On October 11, 1811 Stevens' ship the  Juliana , began operation as the world's first  steam -powered  ferry  with service between Manhattan and Hoboken. In 1825, he designed and built a  steam locomotive  capable of hauling several passenger cars at his estate. In 1832,  Sybil's Cave  opened as an attraction serving spring water, and after 1841 became a legend, when  Edgar Allan Poe  wrote "" The Mystery of Marie Roget "" about an event that took place there. (In the late 1880s, when the water was found to be contaminated, it was shut and in the 1930s, filled with concrete.) Before his death in 1838, Stevens founded  The Hoboken Land Improvement Company , which during the mid- and late-19th century was managed by his heirs and laid out a regular system of streets, blocks and lots, constructed housing, and developed manufacturing sites. In general, the housing consisted of masonry row houses of three to five stories, some of which survive to the present day, as does the street grid. The advantages of Hoboken as a shipping port and industrial center became apparent.   Hoboken was originally formed as a  township  on  April 9 ,  1849 , from portions of  North Bergen Township . As the town grew in population and employment, many of Hoboken's residents saw a need to incorporate as a full-fledged city, and in a referendum held on  March 29 ,  1855 , ratified an Act of the  New Jersey Legislature  signed the previous day, and the City of Hoboken was born. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  In the subsequent election, Cornelius V. Clickener became  Hoboken's first mayor . On  March 15 ,  1859 , the Township of Weehawken was created from portions of Hoboken and  North Bergen Township . [ 21 ]   In 1870, based on a bequest from  Edwin A. Stevens ,  Stevens Institute of Technology  was founded at  Castle Point , site of the Stevens family's former estate. By the late 1800s, great shipping lines were using Hoboken as a terminal port, and the  Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad  (later the  Erie Lackawanna Railroad ] developed a railroad terminal at the waterfront. It was also during this time that  German   immigrants , who had been settling in town during most of the century, became the predominant population group in the city, at least partially due to its being a major destination port of the  Hamburg America Line . In addition to the primary industry of shipbuilding, Hoboken became home to  Keuffel and Esser 's three-story factory and in 1884, to  Tietjan and Lang Drydock  (later Todd Shipyards). Well-known companies that developed a major presence in Hoboken after the turn-of the-century included  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea , and  Hostess .     [ edit ]   Birthplace of baseball          Early baseball game played at  Elysian Fields , Hoboken (Currier & Ives lithograph).       The first officially recorded game of  baseball  in US history took place in Hoboken in 1846  [ 23 ]  between  Knickerbocker Club  and  New York Nine  at  Elysian Fields .   In 1845, the  Knickerbocker Club , which had been founded by Alexander Cartwright, began using  Elysian Fields  to play  baseball  due to the lack of suitable grounds on  Manhattan . [ 24 ]  Team members included players of the St George's Cricket Club, the brothers Harry and George Wright, and Henry Chadwick, the English-born journalist who coined the term ""America's Pastime"".   By the 1850s, several  Manhattan -based members of the  National Association of Base Ball Players  were using the grounds as their home field while St George's continued to organize international matches between Canada, England and the United States at the same venue. In 1859, Jack Parr's All England Eleven of professional cricketers played the United States XXII at Hoboken, easily defeating the local competition. Sam Wright and his sons Harry and George Wright played on the defeated United States team-a loss which inadvertently encouraged local players to take up baseball. Henry Chadwick believed that baseball and not cricket should become America's pastime after the game drawing the conclusion that amateur American players did not have the leisure time required to develop cricket skills to the high technical level required of professional players. Harry and George Wright then became two of America's first professional baseball players when Aaron Champion raised funds to found the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869.   In 1865 the grounds hosted a championship match between the  Mutual Club  of  New York  and the  Atlantic Club  of  Brooklyn  that was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured in the  Currier & Ives   lithograph  ""The American National Game of Base Ball"".   With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences in  Brooklyn , enabling promoters there to charge admission to games, the prominence of  Elysian Fields  diminished. In 1868 the leading  Manhattan  club,  Mutual , shifted its home games to the  Union Grounds  in  Brooklyn . In 1880, the founders of the  New York Metropolitans  and  New York Giants  finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan that became known as the  Polo Grounds .     [ edit ]   ""Heaven, Hell or Hoboken""   When the USA decided to enter World War I the  Hamburg-American Line  piers in Hoboken (and New Orleans) were taken under  eminent domain . Federal control of the port and anti-German sentiment led to part of the city being placed under martial law, and many Germans were forcibly moved to  Ellis Island  or left the city altogether. Hoboken became the major point of embarkation and more than three million soldiers, known as "" doughboys "", passed through the city. Their hope for an early return led to  General Pershing 's slogan, "" Heaven ,  Hell  or Hoboken... by  Christmas .""     [ edit ]   Interwar years   Following the war,  Italians , mostly stemming from the  Adriatic  port city of  Molfetta , became the city's major ethnic group, with the  Irish  also having a strong presence. While the city experienced the Depression, jobs in the ships yards and factories were still available, and the ""tenements"" were full. Middle-European Jews, mostly German-speaking, also made their way to the city and established small businesses. The  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  was established on  April 30 ,  1921 . The  Holland Tunnel  was completed in 1927 and the  Lincoln Tunnel  in (1937), allowing for easier vehicular travel between New Jersey and  New York City , bypassing the waterfront.     [ edit ]   Post-World War II   The war provided a shot in the arm for Hoboken as the many industries located in the city were crucial to the war effort. As men went off to battle, more women were hired in the factories, some (most notably,  Todd Shipyards ), offering classes and other incentives to them. Though some returning service men took advantage of GI housing bills, many with strong ethnic and familial ties chose to stay in town. During the fifties, the economy was still driven by  Todd Shipyards ,  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea ,  Hostess  and  Bethlehem Steel  and companies with big plants still not inclined to invest in huge infrastructure elsewhere. Unions were powerful and the pay was good.   By the sixties, though, things began to disintegrate: turn-of-the century housing started to look shabby and feel crowded, shipbuilding was cheaper overseas, and single-story plants surrounded by parking lots made manufacturing and distribution more economical than old brick buildings on congested urban streets. The city appeared to be in the throes of inexorable decline as industries sought (what had been) greener pastures, port operations shifted to larger facilities on  Newark Bay , and the car, truck and plane displaced the railroad and ship as the transportation modes of choice in the United States. Many Hobokenites headed to the suburbs, often the close-by ones in  Bergen  and  Passaic  Counties, and real-estate values declined. Hoboken sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a rundown condition and was often included in lists with other New Jersey cities experiencing the same phenomenon, such as  Paterson ,  Elizabeth ,  Camden , and neighboring  Jersey City .   The old economic underpinnings were gone and nothing new seemed to be on the horizon. Attempts were made to stabilize the population by demolishing the so-called slums along River Street and build subsidized middle-income housing at Marineview Plaza, and in midtown, at Church Towers. Heaps of long uncollected garbage and roving packs of semi-wild dogs were not uncommon sights. [ 25 ]  Though the city had seen better days, Hoboken was never abandoned. New infusions of immigrants, most notably  Puerto Ricans , kept the storefronts open with small businesses and housing stock from being abandoned, but there wasn't much work to be had. Washington Street, commonly called ""the avenue"", was never boarded up, and the tightly-knit neighborhoods remained home to many who were still proud of their city. Stevens stayed a premiere technology school, Maxwell House kept chugging away, and Bethlehem Steel still housed sailors who were dry-docked on its piers. Italian-Americans and other came back to the ""old neighborhood"" to shop for delicatessen. Some streets were ""iffy"", but most were not pulled in at night.     [ edit ]   On the Waterfront   The waterfront defined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from the mid-19th to mid-20th century, by which time it had become essentially industrial (and mostly inaccessible to the general public). The large production plants of  Lipton Tea  and  Maxwell House , and the  drydocks  of  Bethlehem Steel  dominated the northern portion for many years. The southern portion (which had been a US base of the  Hamburg-American Line ) was seized by the federal government under  eminent domain  at outbreak of  World War I , after which it became (with the rest of the Hudson County) a major East Coast cargo-shipping port.  On the Waterfront , consistently listed among the five best American films ever, was shot in Hoboken, dramatically highlighting the rough and tumble lives of  longshoremen  and the infiltration of unions by organized crime.   With the construction of the  interstate highway  system and  containerization  shipping facilities (particularly at  Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal ), the docks became obsolete, and by the 1970s were more or less abandoned. A large swathe of River Street, known as the  Barbary Coast  for its taverns and boarding houses (which had been home for many dockworkers, sailors, merchant marines, and other seamen) was leveled as part of an  urban renewal  project. Though control of the confiscated area had been returned to the city in the 1950s, complex lease agreements with the  Port Authority  gave it little influence on its management. In the 1980s, the waterfront dominated Hoboken politics, with various civic groups and the city government engaging in sometimes nasty, sometimes absurd politics and court cases. By the 1990s, agreements were made with the  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , various levels of government, Hoboken citizens, and private developers to build commercial and residential buildings and ""open spaces"" (mostly along the bulkhead and on the foundation of un-utilized  Pier A ).          Panorama of Manhattan from Pier A.       The northern portion, which had remained in private hands, has also been re-developed. While most of the dry-dock and production facilities were razed to make way for mid-rise apartment houses, many sold as investment ""condos"", some buildings were renovated for adaptive re-use (notably the Tea Building, formerly home to Lipton Tea, and the Machine House, home of the Hoboken Historic Museum). Zoning requires that new construction follow the street grid and limits the height of new construction to retain the architectural character of the city and open sight-lines to the river. Downtown,  Sinatra Park  and  Sinatra Drive  honor the man most consider to be Hoboken's most famous son, while uptown the name Maxwell recalls the factory with its smell of roasting coffee wafting over town and its huge neon ""Good to the Last Drop"" sign, so long a part of the landscape. The midtown section is dominated by the  serpentine rock  outcropping atop of which sits  Stevens Institute of Technology  (which also owns some, as yet, un-developed land on the river). At the foot of the cliff is  Sybil's Cave  (where 19th century day-trippers once came to ""take the waters"" from a natural spring), long sealed shut, though plans for its restoration are in place. The promenade along the river bank is part of the  Hudson River Waterfront Walkway , a state-mandated master plan to connect the municipalities from the  Bayonne Bridge  to  George Washington Bridge  and provide contiguous unhindered access to the water's edge and to create an urban linear park offering expansive views of the Hudson with the spectacular backdrop of the New York skyline.     [ edit ]   Pre- and post-millennium   During the late 1970s and 1980s, the city witnessed a speculation spree, fueled by transplanted New Yorkers and others who bought many turn-of-the-century brownstones in neighborhoods that the still solid middle and working class population had kept intact and by local and out-of-town real-estate investors who bought up late 19th century apartment houses often considered to be tenements. Hoboken experienced a wave of fires, some of which proved to be arson.  Applied Housing , a real-estate investment firm, took advantage of US government incentives to renovate ""sub-standard"" housing and receive subsidized rental payments (commonly know as  Section 8 ), which enabled some low-income, displaced, and disabled residents to move within town. Hoboken attracted artists, musicians, upwardly-mobile commuters (known as yuppies), and ""bohemian types"" interested in the socio-economic possibilities and challenges of a bankrupt New York and who valued the aesthetics of Hoboken's residential, civic and commercial architecture, its sense of community, and relatively (compared to Lower Manhattan) cheaper rents, and quick, train hop away.  Maxwell's  (a live music venue and restaurant) opened and Hoboken became a ""hip"" place to live. Amid this social upheaval, so-called ""newcomers"" displaced some of the ""old-timers"" in the eastern half of the city.   This  gentrification  resembled that of parts of  Brooklyn  and downtown  Jersey City  and Manhattan's  East Village , (and to a lesser degree,  SoHo  and  TriBeCa , which previously had not been residential). The initial presence of artists and young people changed the perception of the place such that others who would not have considered moving there before perceived it as an interesting, safe, exciting, and eventually, desirable. The process continued as many suburbanites, transplanted Americans, internationals, and immigrants (most focused on opportunities in NY/NJ region and proximity to Manhattan) began to make the ""Jersey"" side of the Hudson their home, and the ""real-estate boom"" of the era encouraged many to seek investment opportunities. Empty lots were built on, tenements became condominiums. Hoboken felt the impact of the destruction of the  World Trade Center  intensely, many of its newer residents having worked there. Re-zoning encouraged new construction on former industrial sites on the waterfront and the traditionally more impoverished low-lying west side of the city where, in concert with Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and New Jersey State land-use policy,  transit villages  are now being promoted. Hoboken became, and remains, a focal point in American rediscovery of urban living, and is often used as staging ground for those wishing to move to the New York/New Jersey metropolitan region.     [ edit ]   Government     [ edit ]   Local government          Hoboken City Hall, on Washington Street between First Street and Newark Street.       The City of Hoboken is governed under the  Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council)  system of municipal government by a Mayor and a nine-member City Council. The City Council consists of three members elected at large from the city as a whole, and six members who each represent one of the city's six wards, all of whom are elected to four-year, staggered terms. Candidates run independent of any political party's backing. [ 26 ]   The Mayor of the City of Hoboken is  David Roberts . [ 27 ]  Members of the City Council are: [ 28 ] [ 29 ]     1st Ward:  Theresa Castallano   6th Ward:  Nino Giacchi  (Council President)   At-Large:  Terry LaBruno  (Council Vice-President)   At-Large:  Peter Cammarano   At-Large:  Ruben Ramos Jr.   2nd Ward:  Beth Mason   3rd Ward:  Michael Russo   4th Ward: Dawn Zimmer   5th Ward: Peter Cunningham         [ edit ]   Mayoral election history   During Hoboken's 150 year history as an incorporated city, the elections that have been held for  Mayor of Hoboken  and members of the Hoboken city council have been largely operated by Hoboken's community. Hoboken's political landscape has been shaped by a strong connection between City Hall and the citizens of Hoboken.

(February 2008)       On the Street     Hoboken was once known as the city with ""a bar on every corner"" and in fact was once listed in the  Guinness Book of Records  as the city with ""Most bars in a square mile"".

As of the  2000 United States Census , the city's population was 38,577. The city is part of the  New York metropolitan area  and contains  Hoboken Terminal , a major transportation hub for the region. Hoboken is also the location of the first recorded  baseball  game in the United States and the  Stevens Institute of Technology , one of the oldest technological universities in the United States.   Hoboken was first settled by as part of  Pavonia, New Netherland  colony in the 17th century. During the early nineteenth century the city was developed by  Colonel John Stevens , first as a resort and later as an residential neighborhood. It became township in 1849 and was incorporated as a city in 1855. It's waterfront was an intergral part of  New York Harbor 's shipping industry and home to major industries for most of the 20th century.

Hoboken lies on the west bank of the  Hudson River  across from the  Manhattan ,  New York City  neighborhoods of the  West Village  and  Chelsea  between  Weehawken Cove  and  Union City  at the north and  Jersey City  (the county seat) at the south and west.   According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 5.1 km (2.0 mi). 3.3 km (1.3 mi) of it is land and 1.8 km (0.7 mi) of it is water. The total area is 35.35% water.   Hoboken has 48 streets laid out in a grid, with numbered streets running east-west. Many north-south streets were named for US presidents (Washington, Adams, Madison, Monroe), though Clinton Street likely honors 19th century politician  DeWitt Clinton .   Hoboken's  zip code  is 07030 and its  area code  is  201  with  551   overlaid .

The  population density  is 11,636.5/km (30,239.2/mi), fourth highest in the nation after neighboring communities of  Guttenberg ,  Union City  and  West New York . [ 8 ]  There are 19,915 housing units at an average density of 6,007.2/km (15,610.7/mi). The racial makeup of the city is 80.82%  White , 4.26%  African American , 0.16%  Native American , 4.31%  Asian , 0.05%  Pacific Islander , 7.63% from  other races , and 2.78% from two or more races. Furthermore 20.18% of those residents also consider themselves to be  Hispanic  or  Latino .   There are 19,418 households out of which 11.4% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 23.8% are  married couples  living together, 9.0% have a female householder with no husband present, and 64.8% are non-families. 41.8% of all households are made up of individuals and 8.0% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 1.92 and the average family size is 2.73.   In the city the population is spread out with 10.5% under the age of 18, 15.3% from 18 to 24, 51.7% from 25 to 44, 13.5% from 45 to 64, and 9.0% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 30 years. For every 100 females, age 18 and over, there are 103.9 males.   The median income for a household in the city as of the last census was $62,550, while the median income for a family was $67,500 (these figures had risen to $96,786 and $107,375 respectively as of a 2007 estimate [ 9 ] ). Males had a median income of $54,870 versus $46,826 for females. The  per capita income  for the city was $43,195. 11.0% of the population and 10.0% of families are below the  poverty line . Out of the total population, 23.6% of those under the age of 18 and 20.7% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.   The city is a  bedroom community  of  New York City , where most of its employed residents work. [ 10 ]  Up to 25% of the population (as of 2008) works in finance or real estate. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The name ""Hoboken"" was decided upon by  Colonel John Stevens  when he purchased land, on a part of which the city still sits.          100 block of Washington Street              Newark Street looking west       It's believed that the  Lenape  (later called  Delaware Indian ) referred to the area as the land of the tobacco pipe, most likely to refer to the  soapstone  collected there to carve  tobacco pipes , and used a phrase that became Hopoghan Hackingh. [ 12 ]   The first Europeans to live there were  Dutch / Flemish  settlers to  New Netherlands  who may have bastardized the Lenape phrase, though there is no known written documentation to confirm it. It also cannot be confirmed that the American Hoboken is named after the Flemish town  Hoboken , annexed in 1983 to  Antwerp ,  Belgium , [ 13 ]  whose name is derived from Middle Dutch  Hooghe Buechen  or  Hoge Beuken , meaning  High  Beeches  or  Tall Beeches . [ 14 ]  The city has also been cited as having been named after the  Van Hoboken  family of the 17th-century estate in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where there is still a square dedicated to them. It is not known what the area was called in  Jersey Dutch , a Dutch-variant language based on  Zeelandic  and Flemish, with English and possibly Lenape influences, spoken in northern New Jersey during the 18th and 19th centuries.   Like  Weehawken , its neighbor to the north,  Communipaw  and  Harsimus  to the south, Hoboken had many variations in the folks-tongue.  Hoebuck , old Dutch for high bluff and likely referring to Castle Point, was used during the colonial era and later spelled in English as  Hobuck , [ 15 ]   Hobock , [ 16 ]  and  Hoboocken . [ 17 ]   Hoboken's unofficial nickname is now the ""Mile Square City"", but it actually covers an area of two square miles when including the under-water parts in the Hudson River. During the late 19th/early 20th century the population and culture of Hoboken was dominated by German language speakers who sometimes called it ""Little Bremen"", many of whom are buried in  Hoboken Cemetery, North Bergen .   The term "" hobo "" (i.e., a railroad journeyman) is believed to have stemmed from the groups of hobos traveling by railroad from Hoboken.

Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (January 2009)         [ edit ]   Early and colonial   Hoboken was originally an island, surrounded by the Hudson River on the east and tidal lands at the foot of the  New Jersey Palisades  on the west. It was a seasonal campsite in the territory of the  Hackensack , a phratry of the  Unami   Lenni Lenape , who used the serpentine rock found there to carve pipes. The first recorded European to lay claim the area was  Henry Hudson , an Englishman sailing for the  Dutch East India Company , who anchored his ship the  Halve Maen  ( Half Moon ) at  Weehawken Cove  on  October 2 ,  1609 . Soon after it became part of province of  New Netherland . In 1630,  Michael Pauw , a burgemeester (mayor) of  Amsterdam  and a director of the  West India Company , received a land grant as  patroon  on the condition that he would plant a colony of not fewer than fifty persons within four years on the west bank of what had been named the  North River . Three  Lenape  sold the land that is was to become Hoboken (and part of Jersey City) for 80 fathoms (146 m) of  wampum , 20 fathoms (37 m) of cloth, 12 kettles, six guns, two blankets, one double kettle and half a barrel of beer. These transactions, variously dated as July 12, 1630 and November 22, 1630, represent the earliest known conveyance for the area. Pauw (whose Latinized name is  Pavonia ) neglected to settle the land and he was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633. It was later acquired by  Hendrick Van Vorst , who leased part of the land to  Aert Van Putten , a farmer. In 1643, north of what would be later known as Castle Point, Van Putten built a house and a brewery, North Americas first. In series of Indian and Dutch raids and reprisals, Van Putten was killed and his buildings destroyed, and all residents of Pavonia (as the colony was known) were ordered back to New Amsterdam. Deteriorating relations with the Lenape, its isolation as an island, or relatively long distance from New Amsterdam may have discouraged more settlement. In 1664, the English took possession of  New Amsterdam  with little or no resistance, and in 1668 they confirmed a previous land patent of by Nicolas Verlett. In 1674-75 the area became part of  East Jersey , and he province was divided into four administrative districts, Hoboken becoming part of  Bergen County , where it remained until the creation of Hudson on  February 22 ,  1840 . English-speaking settlers (some relocating from New England) interspersed with the Dutch, but it remained scarcely populated and agrarian. Eventually, the land came into the possession of  William Bayard , who originally supported the revolutionary cause, but became a  Loyalist Tory  after the fall of New York in 1776 when the city and surrounding areas, including the west bank of the re-named Hudson River, were occupied by the British. At the end of the  Revolutionary War , Bayards property was confiscated by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey. In 1784, the land described as ""William Bayard's farm at Hoebuck"" was bought at auction by Colonel  John Stevens  for 18,360 pounds sterling.     [ edit ]   The 19th century          Ferry slips at Terminal              The  Hudson River  during the 1880s, offshore from Hoboken and  Jersey City .       In the early 1800s, Colonel  John Stevens  developed the waterfront as a resort for Manhattanites, a lucrative source of income, which he may have used for testing his many mechanical  inventions . On October 11, 1811 Stevens' ship the  Juliana , began operation as the world's first  steam -powered  ferry  with service between Manhattan and Hoboken. In 1825, he designed and built a  steam locomotive  capable of hauling several passenger cars at his estate. In 1832,  Sybil's Cave  opened as an attraction serving spring water, and after 1841 became a legend, when  Edgar Allan Poe  wrote "" The Mystery of Marie Roget "" about an event that took place there. (In the late 1880s, when the water was found to be contaminated, it was shut and in the 1930s, filled with concrete.) Before his death in 1838, Stevens founded  The Hoboken Land Improvement Company , which during the mid- and late-19th century was managed by his heirs and laid out a regular system of streets, blocks and lots, constructed housing, and developed manufacturing sites. In general, the housing consisted of masonry row houses of three to five stories, some of which survive to the present day, as does the street grid. The advantages of Hoboken as a shipping port and industrial center became apparent.   Hoboken was originally formed as a  township  on  April 9 ,  1849 , from portions of  North Bergen Township . As the town grew in population and employment, many of Hoboken's residents saw a need to incorporate as a full-fledged city, and in a referendum held on  March 29 ,  1855 , ratified an Act of the  New Jersey Legislature  signed the previous day, and the City of Hoboken was born. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]  In the subsequent election, Cornelius V. Clickener became  Hoboken's first mayor . On  March 15 ,  1859 , the Township of Weehawken was created from portions of Hoboken and  North Bergen Township . [ 18 ]   In 1870, based on a bequest from  Edwin A. Stevens ,  Stevens Institute of Technology  was founded at  Castle Point , site of the Stevens family's former estate. By the late 1800s, great shipping lines were using Hoboken as a terminal port, and the  Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad  (later the  Erie Lackawanna Railroad ] developed a railroad terminal at the waterfront. It was also during this time that  German   immigrants , who had been settling in town during most of the century, became the predominant population group in the city, at least partially due to its being a major destination port of the  Hamburg America Line . In addition to the primary industry of shipbuilding, Hoboken became home to  Keuffel and Esser 's three-story factory and in 1884, to  Tietjan and Lang Drydock  (later Todd Shipyards). Well-known companies that developed a major presence in Hoboken after the turn-of the-century included  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea , and  Hostess .     [ edit ]   Birthplace of baseball          Early baseball game played at  Elysian Fields , Hoboken (Currier & Ives lithograph).       The first officially recorded game of  baseball  in US history took place in Hoboken in 1846  [ 20 ]  between  Knickerbocker Club  and  New York Nine  at  Elysian Fields .   In 1845, the  Knickerbocker Club , which had been founded by Alexander Cartwright, began using  Elysian Fields  to play  baseball  due to the lack of suitable grounds on  Manhattan . [ 21 ]  Team members included players of the St George's Cricket Club, the brothers Harry and George Wright, and Henry Chadwick, the English-born journalist who coined the term ""America's Pastime"".   By the 1850s, several  Manhattan -based members of the  National Association of Base Ball Players  were using the grounds as their home field while St George's continued to organize international matches between Canada, England and the United States at the same venue. In 1859, Jack Parr's All England Eleven of professional cricketers played the United States XXII at Hoboken, easily defeating the local competition. Sam Wright and his sons Harry and George Wright played on the defeated United States team-a loss which inadvertently encouraged local players to take up baseball. Henry Chadwick believed that baseball and not cricket should become America's pastime after the game drawing the conclusion that amateur American players did not have the leisure time required to develop cricket skills to the high technical level required of professional players. Harry and George Wright then became two of America's first professional baseball players when Aaron Champion raised funds to found the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869.   In 1865 the grounds hosted a championship match between the  Mutual Club  of  New York  and the  Atlantic Club  of  Brooklyn  that was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured in the  Currier & Ives   lithograph  ""The American National Game of Base Ball"".   With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences in  Brooklyn , enabling promoters there to charge admission to games, the prominence of  Elysian Fields  diminished. In 1868 the leading  Manhattan  club,  Mutual , shifted its home games to the  Union Grounds  in  Brooklyn . In 1880, the founders of the  New York Metropolitans  and  New York Giants  finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan that became known as the  Polo Grounds .     [ edit ]   ""Heaven, Hell or Hoboken""   When the USA decided to enter World War I the  Hamburg-American Line  piers in Hoboken (and New Orleans) were taken under  eminent domain . Federal control of the port and anti-German sentiment led to part of the city being placed under martial law, and many Germans were forcibly moved to  Ellis Island  or left the city altogether. Hoboken became the major point of embarkation and more than three million soldiers, known as "" doughboys "", passed through the city. Their hope for an early return led to  General Pershing 's slogan, "" Heaven ,  Hell  or Hoboken... by  Christmas .""     [ edit ]   Interwar years   Following the war,  Italians , mostly stemming from the  Adriatic  port city of  Molfetta , became the city's major ethnic group, with the  Irish  also having a strong presence. While the city experienced the Depression, jobs in the ships yards and factories were still available, and the ""tenements"" were full. Middle-European Jews, mostly German-speaking, also made their way to the city and established small businesses. The  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  was established on  April 30 ,  1921 . The  Holland Tunnel  was completed in 1927 and the  Lincoln Tunnel  in (1937), allowing for easier vehicular travel between New Jersey and  New York City , bypassing the waterfront.     [ edit ]   Post-World War II   The war provided a shot in the arm for Hoboken as the many industries located in the city were crucial to the war effort. As men went off to battle, more women were hired in the factories, some (most notably,  Todd Shipyards ), offering classes and other incentives to them. Though some returning service men took advantage of GI housing bills, many with strong ethnic and familial ties chose to stay in town. During the fifties, the economy was still driven by  Todd Shipyards ,  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea ,  Hostess  and  Bethlehem Steel  and companies with big plants still not inclined to invest in huge infrastructure elsewhere. Unions were powerful and the pay was good.   By the sixties, though, things began to disintegrate: turn-of-the century housing started to look shabby and feel crowded, shipbuilding was cheaper overseas, and single-story plants surrounded by parking lots made manufacturing and distribution more economical than old brick buildings on congested urban streets. The city appeared to be in the throes of inexorable decline as industries sought (what had been) greener pastures, port operations shifted to larger facilities on  Newark Bay , and the car, truck and plane displaced the railroad and ship as the transportation modes of choice in the United States. Many Hobokenites headed to the suburbs, often the close-by ones in  Bergen  and  Passaic  Counties, and real-estate values declined. Hoboken sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a rundown condition and was often included in lists with other New Jersey cities experiencing the same phenomenon, such as  Paterson ,  Elizabeth ,  Camden , and neighboring  Jersey City .   The old economic underpinnings were gone and nothing new seemed to be on the horizon. Attempts were made to stabilize the population by demolishing the so-called slums along River Street and build subsidized middle-income housing at Marineview Plaza, and in midtown, at Church Towers. Heaps of long uncollected garbage and roving packs of semi-wild dogs were not uncommon sights. [ 22 ]  Though the city had seen better days, Hoboken was never abandoned. New infusions of immigrants, most notably  Puerto Ricans , kept the storefronts open with small businesses and housing stock from being abandoned, but there wasn't much work to be had. Washington Street, commonly called ""the avenue"", was never boarded up, and the tightly-knit neighborhoods remained home to many who were still proud of their city. Stevens stayed a premiere technology school, Maxwell House kept chugging away, and Bethlehem Steel still housed sailors who were dry-docked on its piers. Italian-Americans and other came back to the ""old neighborhood"" to shop for delicatessen. Some streets were ""iffy"", but most were not pulled in at night.     [ edit ]   On the Waterfront   The waterfront defined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from the mid-19th to mid-20th century, by which time it had become essentially industrial (and mostly inaccessible to the general public). The large production plants of  Lipton Tea  and  Maxwell House , and the  drydocks  of  Bethlehem Steel  dominated the northern portion for many years. The southern portion (which had been a US base of the  Hamburg-American Line ) was seized by the federal government under  eminent domain  at outbreak of  World War I , after which it became (with the rest of the Hudson County) a major East Coast cargo-shipping port.  On the Waterfront , consistently listed among the five best American films ever, was shot in Hoboken, dramatically highlighting the rough and tumble lives of  longshoremen  and the infiltration of unions by organized crime.   With the construction of the  interstate highway  system and  containerization  shipping facilities (particularly at  Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal ), the docks became obsolete, and by the 1970s were more or less abandoned. A large swathe of River Street, known as the  Barbary Coast  for its taverns and boarding houses (which had been home for many dockworkers, sailors, merchant marines, and other seamen) was leveled as part of an  urban renewal  project. Though control of the confiscated area had been returned to the city in the 1950s, complex lease agreements with the  Port Authority  gave it little influence on its management. In the 1980s, the waterfront dominated Hoboken politics, with various civic groups and the city government engaging in sometimes nasty, sometimes absurd politics and court cases. By the 1990s, agreements were made with the  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , various levels of government, Hoboken citizens, and private developers to build commercial and residential buildings and ""open spaces"" (mostly along the bulkhead and on the foundation of un-utilized  Pier A ).          Panorama of Manhattan from Pier A.       The northern portion, which had remained in private hands, has also been re-developed. While most of the dry-dock and production facilities were razed to make way for mid-rise apartment houses, many sold as investment ""condos"", some buildings were renovated for adaptive re-use (notably the Tea Building, formerly home to Lipton Tea, and the Machine House, home of the Hoboken Historic Museum). Zoning requires that new construction follow the street grid and limits the height of new construction to retain the architectural character of the city and open sight-lines to the river. Downtown,  Sinatra Park  and  Sinatra Drive  honor the man most consider to be Hoboken's most famous son, while uptown the name Maxwell recalls the factory with its smell of roasting coffee wafting over town and its huge neon ""Good to the Last Drop"" sign, so long a part of the landscape. The midtown section is dominated by the  serpentine rock  outcropping atop of which sits  Stevens Institute of Technology  (which also owns some, as yet, un-developed land on the river). At the foot of the cliff is  Sybil's Cave  (where 19th century day-trippers once came to ""take the waters"" from a natural spring), long sealed shut, though plans for its restoration are in place. The promenade along the river bank is part of the  Hudson River Waterfront Walkway , a state-mandated master plan to connect the municipalities from the  Bayonne Bridge  to  George Washington Bridge  and provide contiguous unhindered access to the water's edge and to create an urban linear park offering expansive views of the Hudson with the spectacular backdrop of the New York skyline.     [ edit ]   Pre- and post-millennium   During the late 1970s and 1980s, the city witnessed a speculation spree, fueled by transplanted New Yorkers and others who bought many turn-of-the-century brownstones in neighborhoods that the still solid middle and working class population had kept intact and by local and out-of-town real-estate investors who bought up late 19th century apartment houses often considered to be tenements. Hoboken experienced a wave of fires, some of which proved to be arson.  Applied Housing , a real-estate investment firm, took advantage of US government incentives to renovate ""sub-standard"" housing and receive subsidized rental payments (commonly know as  Section 8 ), which enabled some low-income, displaced, and disabled residents to move within town. Hoboken attracted artists, musicians, upwardly-mobile commuters (known as yuppies), and ""bohemian types"" interested in the socio-economic possibilities and challenges of a bankrupt New York and who valued the aesthetics of Hoboken's residential, civic and commercial architecture, its sense of community, and relatively (compared to Lower Manhattan) cheaper rents, and quick, train hop away.  Maxwell's  (a live music venue and restaurant) opened and Hoboken became a ""hip"" place to live. Amid this social upheaval, so-called ""newcomers"" displaced some of the ""old-timers"" in the eastern half of the city.   This  gentrification  resembled that of parts of  Brooklyn  and downtown  Jersey City  and Manhattan's  East Village , (and to a lesser degree,  SoHo  and  TriBeCa , which previously had not been residential). The initial presence of artists and young people changed the perception of the place such that others who would not have considered moving there before perceived it as an interesting, safe, exciting, and eventually, desirable. The process continued as many suburbanites, transplanted Americans, internationals, and immigrants (most focused on opportunities in NY/NJ region and proximity to Manhattan) began to make the ""Jersey"" side of the Hudson their home, and the ""real-estate boom"" of the era encouraged many to seek investment opportunities. Empty lots were built on, tenements became condominiums. Hoboken felt the impact of the destruction of the  World Trade Center  intensely, many of its newer residents having worked there. Re-zoning encouraged new construction on former industrial sites on the waterfront and the traditionally more impoverished low-lying west side of the city where, in concert with Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and New Jersey State land-use policy,  transit villages  are now being promoted. Hoboken became, and remains, a focal point in American rediscovery of urban living, and is often used as staging ground for those wishing to move to the New York/New Jersey metropolitan region.

(February 2008)       On the Street     Hoboken was once known as the city with ""a bar on every corner"" and in fact was once listed in the  Guinness Book of Records  as the city with ""Most bars in a square mile"". [ citation needed ] . However, the local newspaper, the Hoboken Reporter, recently investigated and determined that while there may be the most liquor licenses per corner, New Orleans has more bars per corner. There were well over 200 bars in Hoboken in the first half of the 20th century. There are still well over 100 now. Hoboken limits by law the number of liquor licenses to the number of blocks and the limit is usually reached. Additionally, no license can be moved to within 200 feet (61 m) of another bar or 500 feet (150 m) from a church, which makes it nearly impossible to open a new bar (except in newly renovated perimeter regions of the city).

Brian Stack , reports  today's  Political Insider .    The problem is: Nobody running for mayor of Hoboken wants to be seen taking outside help. Taking assistance or even having the vocal support of the Hudson County political machine can be looked down upon by some of Hoboken's residents, particularly the newer ones.

Hoboken Now  was out and about in Hoboken today when we spotted this U.S. Army Corps of Engineers boat pulling up to Hoboken terminal.    Turns out the boat is part of the team looking for the missing engine of  U.S. Airways flight 1549 that ""splash landed"" in the Hudson River  this week. Crews aboard the boat told us the plane was being pulled out of its mooring spot in the river this afternoon -- and they were stopping in Hoboken for lunch.    I recommended Bagel Express.

Jason Guerette  is the 14th member of Hoboken's Boy Scouts of America Troop 146 to reach the level of Eagle Scout. Guerette was inducted last Saturday, Jan. 10 in a ceremony at St. Matthews Lutheran Church in Hoboken.   In order to reach Eagle Scout, Guerette had to complete a community service project. He organized a collection drive of baby clothes and materials and spent a troop day doing maintenance and playing with the children for  Hudson Cradle , a non-profit infant and toddler care center for at-risk children in Jersey City.

Courtesy of  OurHoboken.com   Bhalla is an attorney in Hoboken and a Democratic committeeman.   Some of the issues he'll be focusing on in his campaign are fiscal responsibility, transparency in Hoboken government (such as citizens' requests for budget information) and installing things like a 311 call center for city services and non-emergency public safety concerns (like what they have in New York.) Bhalla would also like to improve Hoboken's municipal website.

The  Unisphere  located in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park has become a symbol for Queens County.       Flushing , founded in 1645, is a neighborhood in the north central part of the City of  New York   borough  of  Queens , ten miles (16 km) east of  Manhattan .

Today, it is one of the largest and most diverse neighborhoods in New York City and has expanded well beyond its original boundaries. Flushing's diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside here including people of European, Asian, Hispanic and African-American descent. It is part of the  Fifth Congressional District , which encompasses the entire northeastern shore of Queens County, and extends into neighboring  Nassau County .

The village was named after the city of  Vlissingen , in the southwestern  Netherlands , the main port of the company.   In its early days, the village of Flushing was inhabited by English colonists, among them a farmer named  John Bowne . John Bowne defied a prohibition imposed by New Amsterdam Director-General  Peter Stuyvesant  on harboring Quakers by allowing  Quaker  meetings in his home. Today, landmarks from the Dutch period in Flushing include the  John Bowne House  on Bowne Street and the  Old Quaker Meeting House  on  Northern Boulevard .   The  Flushing Remonstrance , signed in Flushing on December 27, 1657, protested religious persecution and eventually led to the decision by the Dutch West India Company to allow Quakers and others to worship freely. As such, Flushing is claimed to be a birthplace of religious freedom in the new world.  [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   English colonial history   In 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, ending Dutch control of the colony, and renamed it New York. Flushing remained a small Long Island village.   Flushing was the site of the first commercial  tree nurseries  in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. Much of the northern section of  Kissena Park , former site of the Parsons nursery, still contains a wide variety of exotic trees. The naming of streets intersecting Kissena Boulevard on its way toward Kissena Park celebrates this fact (Ash Avenue, Beech, Cherry ...Poplar, Quince, Rose). Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward project, now known as  Central Park  in Manhattan.   During the American Revolution, Flushing, along with most settlements in present-day Queens County, favored the British and quartered British troops. Following the  Battle of Long Island ,  Nathan Hale , an officer in the  Continental Army , was apprehended near Flushing Bay while on what was probably an intelligence gathering mission and was later hanged.   The 1785  Kingsland Homestead , originally the residence of a wealthy  Quaker  merchant, now serves as the home of the  Queens Historical Society . [ 3 ]   The 1790 United States census recorded that 5,393 people lived in what is present-day Queens County.     [ edit ]   Nineteenth century   During the 1800s, as New York City continued to grow in population and economic strength, Flushing's proximity to Manhattan was critical to its growth and transformation to a fashionable residential area.          Map of Flushing in 1891.       In 1813, the village of Flushing was incorporated into the Town of Flushing. By the mid-1860s, Queens County had 30,429 residents. Flushing's expansion continued in 1867 and 1868 when the neighboring villages of College Point and Whitestone were incorporated into the Town of Flushing.   In 1898, although opposed to the proposal, Flushing along with a re-drawn Queens County was consolidated into the City of New York. Local farmland continued to be subdivided and developed transforming Flushing into a densely populated neighborhood of New York City.     [ edit ]   Twentieth century and World's Fairs   The continued construction of bridges over the Flushing River and the development of other roads increased the volume of vehicular traffic into Flushing. In 1909, the construction of the  Queensborough Bridge  over the  East River  connected Queens County to  midtown Manhattan .   The introduction of rail road service to Manhattan in 1910 by the  Long Island Rail Road  Port Washington Branch and in 1928 by the  New York City Transit Authority  Number 7 subway line hastened the continued transformation of Flushing to a commuter suburb and commercial center. Due to increased traffic, a main roadway through Flushing named Broadway was widened and renamed Northern Boulevard.   Flushing was a forerunner of Hollywood, when the young American film industry was still based on the East Coast and  Chicago . Decades later, the  RKO  Keith's movie palace would host  vaudeville  acts and appearances by the likes of  Mickey Rooney ,  The Marx Brothers  and  Bob Hope . The theater now lies vacant and in disrepair due to an unauthorized real estate development project that took place in the early 1990s.   The  1939-1940 World's Fair  was held in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. [ 4 ]  Massive preparations for the Fair began in 1936 and included the elimination of the Corona dumps. Among the innovations presented to the world in 1939 was the  television , which broadcast a speech by  Franklin D. Roosevelt .   After the World's Fair, the New York City pavilion was converted into the temporary headquarters of the United Nations where, in 1947, the  UN voted  in favor of the establishment of the  State of Israel .   A second World's Fair, the  1964-1965 World's Fair  was also held at the site of the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.  Pope Paul VI  attended the Fair on October 4, 1965. On this papal trip, Pope Paul VI became the first pope to visit the United States. An  exedra  now commemorates the site of the Vatican pavilion.  Michelangelo 's masterpiece, the  Piet , was exhibited during his trip.   Following the Fair, the  Unisphere , the New York State Pavilion and the New York City Pavilion remained in the park. The NYC Pavilion was converted into an ice-skating rink and later, the ice rink became the Queens Museum of Art.     [ edit ]   Landmarks, museums and cultural institutions   There are numerous historic structures located in Flushing.   Flushing Town Hall  [1]  is located on Northern Boulevard and is the headquarters of the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts. It is an affiliate of the  Smithsonian Institution  in Washington, D.C.  [ 5 ]  The building houses a concert hall and cultural center and is one of the sites designated along the Queens Historical Society's Freedom Mile  [2] .   Other registered New York City Landmarks include the  Bowne House ,  Kingsland Homestead ,  Old Quaker Meeting House  (1694),  Flushing High School , St. George's Church (1854), the  Lewis H. Latimer House , the former  RKO  Keith's movie theater, the United States Post Office on Main Street and the  Unisphere , a 12-story high, stainless steel globe that served as the centerpiece for the  1964 New York World's Fair . The Flushing Armory, on Northern Boulevard, was formerly used by the National Guard. Presently, the Queens North Task Force of the  New York City Police Department  uses this building. [ 6 ]  In 2005, the Fitzgerald-Ginsberg Mansion [3]  on Bayside Avenue and in 2007, the Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden  [4]  were designated as landmarks.          Marker of the two time capsules       Several attractions originally developed for the World's Fairs in  Flushing Meadows-Corona Park  are worth visiting. There is a stone marker for the two 5,000-year  Westinghouse Time Capsules  made of special  alloys  buried in the park, chronicling 20th Century life in the United States dedicated both in 1938 and 1965. Also located in the park are the  Queens Museum of Art  which features a scale model of the City of New York, the largest architectural model ever built; Queens Theatre in the Park  [5] ; the  New York Hall of Science  and the  Queens Zoo .   The  Queens Botanical Garden  located on Main Street, has been in operation continuously since its opening as an exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair. The Botanical Garden carries on Flushing's nearly three centuries long horticultural tradition, dating back to its once famed tree nurseries and seed farms.     [ edit ]   Demographics   The 2000 United States Census Bureau ranked Queens County as the ninth most populous county in the United States with over 2.2 million residents. According to the Census Bureau, Queens County experienced over a 14% increase in population since the 1990 census.   The 2000 Census also reflected the growth of the  Asian American  population in Queens County with over 391,500 people identifying themselves as Asian Americans. That number was the largest in New York City, more than twice the number of people identifying themselves as  Asian-American  in Brooklyn. The 2000 Census revealed that the 5th Congressional District had almost 655,000 residents. Approximately 364,200 residents or 55% of the District identified themselves as white. A total of 160,896 residents or 25% of the District identified themselves as Asian Americans and 153,721 or 24% identified themselves as Hispanic.   [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Religion   Flushing is a very religiously diverse community in America (if not the most). There are ""over 200 places of worship in a small urban neighborhood about 2.5 square miles [6.5 square kilometers]."" [ 9 ]  ""Flushing has become a model for religious pluralism in America, says R. Scott Hanson, a visiting assistant professor of history at the State University of New York at Binghamton and an affiliate of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University."" [ 10 ]   In 1657, while Flushing was still a Dutch settlement, a document known as the  Flushing Remonstrance  was created by Edward Hart, the town clerk, where some thirty ordinary citizens protested a ban imposed by Peter Stuyvesant, the director general of New Amsterdam, forbidding the harboring of Quakers. The Flushing Remonstrance cited the Flushing Town charter of 1645 which promised liberty of conscience. [ 11 ]   Today, Flushing abounds in houses of worship, ranging from the Dutch colonial epoch Quaker Meeting House, St. George's Episcopal Church, the Free Synagogue of Flushing, St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - the largest Greek Orthodox Church in the United States. The New York Times     [ edit ]   Ethnic culture          Roosevelt Avenue is one of the main commercial streets in Flushing.       The intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, the business center for Flushing located at the terminus of the Number 7 subway line on the westernmost edge of the neighborhood has a concentration of Chinese and Korean small businesses among others. Today, this area is also known for its selection of authentic Chinese, Korean and Asian restaurants.   Other areas of Flushing continue to maintain a large Italian and Greek presence reflected in the many Italian and Greek bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants in the northern and eastern sections of the neighborhood.   An area south of Franklin Avenue is home to an Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi market. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Neighborhoods   Broadway-Flushing , also known as North Flushing, is a residential area with many large homes. Part of this area has been designated a State and Federal historic district due to the elegant, park-like character of the neighborhood. Recently much of the area was rezoned by the City of New York to preserve the low density, residential quality of the area. The neighborhood awaits designation as an Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Broadway-Flushing is bounded by 29 th  Avenue to the north, Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue to the south, 155 st  to the west and 172 nd  Streets to the east. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Parks   All the public parks and playgrounds in Flushing are supervised by the  New York City Department of Parks and Recreation . For Queens County, the Department of Parks and Recreation is headquartered at The Overlook in Forest Park located in Kew Gardens.     Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , a 1,255-acre (5.08 km 2 ) park, is considered a flagship park in Queens. The site hosted two World's Fairs, the first in 1939-1940 and the second in 1964-1965. As the result, the park infrastructure reflects the construction undertaken for the Fairs. Also located here is Citi Field and the National Tennis Center which is the home of the US Tennis Open. In 2008, a new Aquatic Center was opened in the park [6] .       Kissena Park  is a 234-acre (0.95 km 2 ) park with a lake as a centerpiece.       Bowne Park is an 11-acre (45,000 m 2 ) park developed on the former estate of New York City Mayor Walter Bowne.       Flushing Fields is a 10-acre (40,000 m 2 ) greenbelt that includes the home athletic field of Flushing High School.       [ edit ]   Education   The public schools in Flushing are all supervised by the New York City Department of Education through Administrative District 25.   There are numerous public Elementary and Junior High Schools in Flushing and students generally attend a school based on the location of their residence.     [ edit ]   Libraries   In 1858, the first library in Queens County was founded in Flushing. Today, there are eight branches of the  Queens Borough Public Library  with Flushing addresses. [ 13 ]  The largest of the Flushing branches is located at the intersection of Kissena Boulevard and Main Street, [ 14 ]  and is the largest branch library in New York City, and the busiest branch of the highest circulation system  [7]  in the country . [ 15 ]  This library has developed into a valuable community resource and houses an auditorium for public events. The current building, designed by Polshek Partnership Architects, is the third to be built on the site--the first was a gift of  Andrew Carnegie .

[ edit ]   Public transportation           7 train  Flushing station         [ edit ]   Subway service   The New York City Transit Authority operates the Flushing Number 7 subway line, which provides a direct rail link to Grand Central Station and Times Square in Manhattan. The  Flushing-Main Street subway station  located at the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue is the eastern terminus of the line. Until the Flushing Number 7 made its way to the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue in 1928, the center of Flushing was considered to be at the intersection of Northern Boulevard and Main Street.     [ edit ]   Railroad service   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority operates the Long Island Rail Road Port Washington Branch that has five rail road stations in Flushing. The  Flushing-Main Street Station  of the  Long Island Rail Road  is located one block away from the subway station that bears the same name. The Long Island Rail Road also has stations at  Shea Stadium ,  Murray Hill ,  Broadway  and  Auburndale . The Long Island Rail Road provides a direct rail link to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.

Shea Stadium  was the home park until the end of the 2008 season. The United States Tennis Association's National Tennis Center hosts the  U.S. Open  Tournament in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park every year. This tournament relocated to Flushing from its original home in Forest Hills, Queens.   Shea Stadium has hosted four  World Series , in 1969, 1973, 1986 and 2000. In 2009, Shea Stadium will be replaced by  Citi Field , which is currently under construction in one of the parking areas of Shea Stadium.     The New York Mets  [8]   The USTA National Tennis Center  [9]       [ edit ]   Popular culture     The first series of  Charmin  toilet paper commercials featuring  Mr. Whipple  ( Dick Wilson ) were filmed in Flushing at the Trade Rite supermarket on Bowne Street.

As of the  2000 United States Census , the city's population was 38,577. The city is part of the  New York metropolitan area  and contains  Hoboken Terminal , a major transportation hub for the region. Hoboken is also the location of the first recorded  baseball  game in the United States and the  Stevens Institute of Technology , one of the oldest technological universities in the United States.   Hoboken was first settled by as part of  Pavonia, New Netherland  colony in the 17th century. During the early nineteenth century the city was developed by  Colonel John Stevens , first as a resort and later as an residential neighborhood. It became township in 1849 and was incorporated as a city in 1855. It's waterfront was an intergral part of  New York Harbor 's shipping industry and home to major industries for most of the 20th century.

Hoboken lies on the west bank of the  Hudson River  across from the  Manhattan ,  New York City  neighborhoods of the  West Village  and  Chelsea  between  Weehawken Cove  and  Union City  at the north and  Jersey City  (the county seat) at the south and west.   According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 5.1 km (2.0 mi). 3.3 km (1.3 mi) of it is land and 1.8 km (0.7 mi) of it is water. The total area is 35.35% water.   Hoboken has 48 streets laid out in a grid, with numbered streets running east-west. Many north-south streets were named for US presidents (Washington, Adams, Madison, Monroe), though Clinton Street likely honors 19th century politician  DeWitt Clinton .   Hoboken's  zip code  is 07030 and its  area code  is  201  with  551   overlaid .

The  population density  is 11,636.5/km (30,239.2/mi), fourth highest in the nation after neighboring communities of  Guttenberg ,  Union City  and  West New York . [ 8 ]  There are 19,915 housing units at an average density of 6,007.2/km (15,610.7/mi). The racial makeup of the city is 80.82%  White , 4.26%  African American , 0.16%  Native American , 4.31%  Asian , 0.05%  Pacific Islander , 7.63% from  other races , and 2.78% from two or more races. Furthermore 20.18% of those residents also consider themselves to be  Hispanic  or  Latino .   There are 19,418 households out of which 11.4% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 23.8% are  married couples  living together, 9.0% have a female householder with no husband present, and 64.8% are non-families. 41.8% of all households are made up of individuals and 8.0% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 1.92 and the average family size is 2.73.   In the city the population is spread out with 10.5% under the age of 18, 15.3% from 18 to 24, 51.7% from 25 to 44, 13.5% from 45 to 64, and 9.0% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 30 years. For every 100 females, age 18 and over, there are 103.9 males.   The median income for a household in the city as of the last census was $62,550, while the median income for a family was $67,500 (these figures had risen to $96,786 and $107,375 respectively as of a 2007 estimate [ 9 ] ). Males had a median income of $54,870 versus $46,826 for females. The  per capita income  for the city was $43,195. 11.0% of the population and 10.0% of families are below the  poverty line . Out of the total population, 23.6% of those under the age of 18 and 20.7% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.   The city is a  bedroom community  of  New York City , where most of its employed residents work. [ 10 ]  Up to 25% of the population (as of 2008) works in finance or real estate. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The name ""Hoboken"" was decided upon by  Colonel John Stevens  when he purchased land, on a part of which the city still sits.          100 block of Washington Street              Newark Street looking west       It's believed that the  Lenape  (later called  Delaware Indian ) referred to the area as the land of the tobacco pipe, most likely to refer to the  soapstone  collected there to carve  tobacco pipes , and used a phrase that became Hopoghan Hackingh. [ 12 ]   The first Europeans to live there were  Dutch / Flemish  settlers to  New Netherlands  who may have bastardized the Lenape phrase, though there is no known written documentation to confirm it. It also cannot be confirmed that the American Hoboken is named after the Flemish town  Hoboken , annexed in 1983 to  Antwerp ,  Belgium , [ 13 ]  whose name is derived from Middle Dutch  Hooghe Buechen  or  Hoge Beuken , meaning  High  Beeches  or  Tall Beeches . [ 14 ]  The city has also been cited as having been named after the  Van Hoboken  family of the 17th-century estate in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where there is still a square dedicated to them. It is not known what the area was called in  Jersey Dutch , a Dutch-variant language based on  Zeelandic  and Flemish, with English and possibly Lenape influences, spoken in northern New Jersey during the 18th and 19th centuries.   Like  Weehawken , its neighbor to the north,  Communipaw  and  Harsimus  to the south, Hoboken had many variations in the folks-tongue.  Hoebuck , old Dutch for high bluff and likely referring to Castle Point, was used during the colonial era and later spelled in English as  Hobuck , [ 15 ]   Hobock , [ 16 ]  and  Hoboocken . [ 17 ]   Hoboken's unofficial nickname is now the ""Mile Square City"", but it actually covers an area of two square miles when including the under-water parts in the Hudson River. During the late 19th/early 20th century the population and culture of Hoboken was dominated by German language speakers who sometimes called it ""Little Bremen"", many of whom are buried in  Hoboken Cemetery, North Bergen .   The term "" hobo "" (i.e., a railroad journeyman) is believed to have stemmed from the groups of hobos traveling by railroad from Hoboken.

Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (January 2009)         [ edit ]   Early and colonial   Hoboken was originally an island, surrounded by the Hudson River on the east and tidal lands at the foot of the  New Jersey Palisades  on the west. It was a seasonal campsite in the territory of the  Hackensack , a phratry of the  Unami   Lenni Lenape , who used the serpentine rock found there to carve pipes. The first recorded European to lay claim the area was  Henry Hudson , an Englishman sailing for the  Dutch East India Company , who anchored his ship the  Halve Maen  ( Half Moon ) at  Weehawken Cove  on  October 2 ,  1609 . Soon after it became part of province of  New Netherland . In 1630,  Michael Pauw , a burgemeester (mayor) of  Amsterdam  and a director of the  West India Company , received a land grant as  patroon  on the condition that he would plant a colony of not fewer than fifty persons within four years on the west bank of what had been named the  North River . Three  Lenape  sold the land that is was to become Hoboken (and part of Jersey City) for 80 fathoms (146 m) of  wampum , 20 fathoms (37 m) of cloth, 12 kettles, six guns, two blankets, one double kettle and half a barrel of beer. These transactions, variously dated as July 12, 1630 and November 22, 1630, represent the earliest known conveyance for the area. Pauw (whose Latinized name is  Pavonia ) neglected to settle the land and he was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633. It was later acquired by  Hendrick Van Vorst , who leased part of the land to  Aert Van Putten , a farmer. In 1643, north of what would be later known as Castle Point, Van Putten built a house and a brewery, North Americas first. In series of Indian and Dutch raids and reprisals, Van Putten was killed and his buildings destroyed, and all residents of Pavonia (as the colony was known) were ordered back to New Amsterdam. Deteriorating relations with the Lenape, its isolation as an island, or relatively long distance from New Amsterdam may have discouraged more settlement. In 1664, the English took possession of  New Amsterdam  with little or no resistance, and in 1668 they confirmed a previous land patent of by Nicolas Verlett. In 1674-75 the area became part of  East Jersey , and he province was divided into four administrative districts, Hoboken becoming part of  Bergen County , where it remained until the creation of Hudson on  February 22 ,  1840 . English-speaking settlers (some relocating from New England) interspersed with the Dutch, but it remained scarcely populated and agrarian. Eventually, the land came into the possession of  William Bayard , who originally supported the revolutionary cause, but became a  Loyalist Tory  after the fall of New York in 1776 when the city and surrounding areas, including the west bank of the re-named Hudson River, were occupied by the British. At the end of the  Revolutionary War , Bayards property was confiscated by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey. In 1784, the land described as ""William Bayard's farm at Hoebuck"" was bought at auction by Colonel  John Stevens  for 18,360 pounds sterling.     [ edit ]   The 19th century          Ferry slips at Terminal              The  Hudson River  during the 1880s, offshore from Hoboken and  Jersey City .       In the early 1800s, Colonel  John Stevens  developed the waterfront as a resort for Manhattanites, a lucrative source of income, which he may have used for testing his many mechanical  inventions . On October 11, 1811 Stevens' ship the  Juliana , began operation as the world's first  steam -powered  ferry  with service between Manhattan and Hoboken. In 1825, he designed and built a  steam locomotive  capable of hauling several passenger cars at his estate. In 1832,  Sybil's Cave  opened as an attraction serving spring water, and after 1841 became a legend, when  Edgar Allan Poe  wrote "" The Mystery of Marie Roget "" about an event that took place there. (In the late 1880s, when the water was found to be contaminated, it was shut and in the 1930s, filled with concrete.) Before his death in 1838, Stevens founded  The Hoboken Land Improvement Company , which during the mid- and late-19th century was managed by his heirs and laid out a regular system of streets, blocks and lots, constructed housing, and developed manufacturing sites. In general, the housing consisted of masonry row houses of three to five stories, some of which survive to the present day, as does the street grid. The advantages of Hoboken as a shipping port and industrial center became apparent.   Hoboken was originally formed as a  township  on  April 9 ,  1849 , from portions of  North Bergen Township . As the town grew in population and employment, many of Hoboken's residents saw a need to incorporate as a full-fledged city, and in a referendum held on  March 29 ,  1855 , ratified an Act of the  New Jersey Legislature  signed the previous day, and the City of Hoboken was born. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]  In the subsequent election, Cornelius V. Clickener became  Hoboken's first mayor . On  March 15 ,  1859 , the Township of Weehawken was created from portions of Hoboken and  North Bergen Township . [ 18 ]   In 1870, based on a bequest from  Edwin A. Stevens ,  Stevens Institute of Technology  was founded at  Castle Point , site of the Stevens family's former estate. By the late 1800s, great shipping lines were using Hoboken as a terminal port, and the  Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad  (later the  Erie Lackawanna Railroad ] developed a railroad terminal at the waterfront. It was also during this time that  German   immigrants , who had been settling in town during most of the century, became the predominant population group in the city, at least partially due to its being a major destination port of the  Hamburg America Line . In addition to the primary industry of shipbuilding, Hoboken became home to  Keuffel and Esser 's three-story factory and in 1884, to  Tietjan and Lang Drydock  (later Todd Shipyards). Well-known companies that developed a major presence in Hoboken after the turn-of the-century included  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea , and  Hostess .     [ edit ]   Birthplace of baseball          Early baseball game played at  Elysian Fields , Hoboken (Currier & Ives lithograph).       The first officially recorded game of  baseball  in US history took place in Hoboken in 1846  [ 20 ]  between  Knickerbocker Club  and  New York Nine  at  Elysian Fields .   In 1845, the  Knickerbocker Club , which had been founded by Alexander Cartwright, began using  Elysian Fields  to play  baseball  due to the lack of suitable grounds on  Manhattan . [ 21 ]  Team members included players of the St George's Cricket Club, the brothers Harry and George Wright, and Henry Chadwick, the English-born journalist who coined the term ""America's Pastime"".   By the 1850s, several  Manhattan -based members of the  National Association of Base Ball Players  were using the grounds as their home field while St George's continued to organize international matches between Canada, England and the United States at the same venue. In 1859, Jack Parr's All England Eleven of professional cricketers played the United States XXII at Hoboken, easily defeating the local competition. Sam Wright and his sons Harry and George Wright played on the defeated United States team-a loss which inadvertently encouraged local players to take up baseball. Henry Chadwick believed that baseball and not cricket should become America's pastime after the game drawing the conclusion that amateur American players did not have the leisure time required to develop cricket skills to the high technical level required of professional players. Harry and George Wright then became two of America's first professional baseball players when Aaron Champion raised funds to found the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869.   In 1865 the grounds hosted a championship match between the  Mutual Club  of  New York  and the  Atlantic Club  of  Brooklyn  that was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured in the  Currier & Ives   lithograph  ""The American National Game of Base Ball"".   With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences in  Brooklyn , enabling promoters there to charge admission to games, the prominence of  Elysian Fields  diminished. In 1868 the leading  Manhattan  club,  Mutual , shifted its home games to the  Union Grounds  in  Brooklyn . In 1880, the founders of the  New York Metropolitans  and  New York Giants  finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan that became known as the  Polo Grounds .     [ edit ]   ""Heaven, Hell or Hoboken""   When the USA decided to enter World War I the  Hamburg-American Line  piers in Hoboken (and New Orleans) were taken under  eminent domain . Federal control of the port and anti-German sentiment led to part of the city being placed under martial law, and many Germans were forcibly moved to  Ellis Island  or left the city altogether. Hoboken became the major point of embarkation and more than three million soldiers, known as "" doughboys "", passed through the city. Their hope for an early return led to  General Pershing 's slogan, "" Heaven ,  Hell  or Hoboken... by  Christmas .""     [ edit ]   Interwar years   Following the war,  Italians , mostly stemming from the  Adriatic  port city of  Molfetta , became the city's major ethnic group, with the  Irish  also having a strong presence. While the city experienced the Depression, jobs in the ships yards and factories were still available, and the ""tenements"" were full. Middle-European Jews, mostly German-speaking, also made their way to the city and established small businesses. The  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  was established on  April 30 ,  1921 . The  Holland Tunnel  was completed in 1927 and the  Lincoln Tunnel  in (1937), allowing for easier vehicular travel between New Jersey and  New York City , bypassing the waterfront.     [ edit ]   Post-World War II   The war provided a shot in the arm for Hoboken as the many industries located in the city were crucial to the war effort. As men went off to battle, more women were hired in the factories, some (most notably,  Todd Shipyards ), offering classes and other incentives to them. Though some returning service men took advantage of GI housing bills, many with strong ethnic and familial ties chose to stay in town. During the fifties, the economy was still driven by  Todd Shipyards ,  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea ,  Hostess  and  Bethlehem Steel  and companies with big plants still not inclined to invest in huge infrastructure elsewhere. Unions were powerful and the pay was good.   By the sixties, though, things began to disintegrate: turn-of-the century housing started to look shabby and feel crowded, shipbuilding was cheaper overseas, and single-story plants surrounded by parking lots made manufacturing and distribution more economical than old brick buildings on congested urban streets. The city appeared to be in the throes of inexorable decline as industries sought (what had been) greener pastures, port operations shifted to larger facilities on  Newark Bay , and the car, truck and plane displaced the railroad and ship as the transportation modes of choice in the United States. Many Hobokenites headed to the suburbs, often the close-by ones in  Bergen  and  Passaic  Counties, and real-estate values declined. Hoboken sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a rundown condition and was often included in lists with other New Jersey cities experiencing the same phenomenon, such as  Paterson ,  Elizabeth ,  Camden , and neighboring  Jersey City .   The old economic underpinnings were gone and nothing new seemed to be on the horizon. Attempts were made to stabilize the population by demolishing the so-called slums along River Street and build subsidized middle-income housing at Marineview Plaza, and in midtown, at Church Towers. Heaps of long uncollected garbage and roving packs of semi-wild dogs were not uncommon sights. [ 22 ]  Though the city had seen better days, Hoboken was never abandoned. New infusions of immigrants, most notably  Puerto Ricans , kept the storefronts open with small businesses and housing stock from being abandoned, but there wasn't much work to be had. Washington Street, commonly called ""the avenue"", was never boarded up, and the tightly-knit neighborhoods remained home to many who were still proud of their city. Stevens stayed a premiere technology school, Maxwell House kept chugging away, and Bethlehem Steel still housed sailors who were dry-docked on its piers. Italian-Americans and other came back to the ""old neighborhood"" to shop for delicatessen. Some streets were ""iffy"", but most were not pulled in at night.     [ edit ]   On the Waterfront   The waterfront defined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from the mid-19th to mid-20th century, by which time it had become essentially industrial (and mostly inaccessible to the general public). The large production plants of  Lipton Tea  and  Maxwell House , and the  drydocks  of  Bethlehem Steel  dominated the northern portion for many years. The southern portion (which had been a US base of the  Hamburg-American Line ) was seized by the federal government under  eminent domain  at outbreak of  World War I , after which it became (with the rest of the Hudson County) a major East Coast cargo-shipping port.  On the Waterfront , consistently listed among the five best American films ever, was shot in Hoboken, dramatically highlighting the rough and tumble lives of  longshoremen  and the infiltration of unions by organized crime.   With the construction of the  interstate highway  system and  containerization  shipping facilities (particularly at  Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal ), the docks became obsolete, and by the 1970s were more or less abandoned. A large swathe of River Street, known as the  Barbary Coast  for its taverns and boarding houses (which had been home for many dockworkers, sailors, merchant marines, and other seamen) was leveled as part of an  urban renewal  project. Though control of the confiscated area had been returned to the city in the 1950s, complex lease agreements with the  Port Authority  gave it little influence on its management. In the 1980s, the waterfront dominated Hoboken politics, with various civic groups and the city government engaging in sometimes nasty, sometimes absurd politics and court cases. By the 1990s, agreements were made with the  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , various levels of government, Hoboken citizens, and private developers to build commercial and residential buildings and ""open spaces"" (mostly along the bulkhead and on the foundation of un-utilized  Pier A ).          Panorama of Manhattan from Pier A.       The northern portion, which had remained in private hands, has also been re-developed. While most of the dry-dock and production facilities were razed to make way for mid-rise apartment houses, many sold as investment ""condos"", some buildings were renovated for adaptive re-use (notably the Tea Building, formerly home to Lipton Tea, and the Machine House, home of the Hoboken Historic Museum). Zoning requires that new construction follow the street grid and limits the height of new construction to retain the architectural character of the city and open sight-lines to the river. Downtown,  Sinatra Park  and  Sinatra Drive  honor the man most consider to be Hoboken's most famous son, while uptown the name Maxwell recalls the factory with its smell of roasting coffee wafting over town and its huge neon ""Good to the Last Drop"" sign, so long a part of the landscape. The midtown section is dominated by the  serpentine rock  outcropping atop of which sits  Stevens Institute of Technology  (which also owns some, as yet, un-developed land on the river). At the foot of the cliff is  Sybil's Cave  (where 19th century day-trippers once came to ""take the waters"" from a natural spring), long sealed shut, though plans for its restoration are in place. The promenade along the river bank is part of the  Hudson River Waterfront Walkway , a state-mandated master plan to connect the municipalities from the  Bayonne Bridge  to  George Washington Bridge  and provide contiguous unhindered access to the water's edge and to create an urban linear park offering expansive views of the Hudson with the spectacular backdrop of the New York skyline.     [ edit ]   Pre- and post-millennium   During the late 1970s and 1980s, the city witnessed a speculation spree, fueled by transplanted New Yorkers and others who bought many turn-of-the-century brownstones in neighborhoods that the still solid middle and working class population had kept intact and by local and out-of-town real-estate investors who bought up late 19th century apartment houses often considered to be tenements. Hoboken experienced a wave of fires, some of which proved to be arson.  Applied Housing , a real-estate investment firm, took advantage of US government incentives to renovate ""sub-standard"" housing and receive subsidized rental payments (commonly know as  Section 8 ), which enabled some low-income, displaced, and disabled residents to move within town. Hoboken attracted artists, musicians, upwardly-mobile commuters (known as yuppies), and ""bohemian types"" interested in the socio-economic possibilities and challenges of a bankrupt New York and who valued the aesthetics of Hoboken's residential, civic and commercial architecture, its sense of community, and relatively (compared to Lower Manhattan) cheaper rents, and quick, train hop away.  Maxwell's  (a live music venue and restaurant) opened and Hoboken became a ""hip"" place to live. Amid this social upheaval, so-called ""newcomers"" displaced some of the ""old-timers"" in the eastern half of the city.   This  gentrification  resembled that of parts of  Brooklyn  and downtown  Jersey City  and Manhattan's  East Village , (and to a lesser degree,  SoHo  and  TriBeCa , which previously had not been residential). The initial presence of artists and young people changed the perception of the place such that others who would not have considered moving there before perceived it as an interesting, safe, exciting, and eventually, desirable. The process continued as many suburbanites, transplanted Americans, internationals, and immigrants (most focused on opportunities in NY/NJ region and proximity to Manhattan) began to make the ""Jersey"" side of the Hudson their home, and the ""real-estate boom"" of the era encouraged many to seek investment opportunities. Empty lots were built on, tenements became condominiums. Hoboken felt the impact of the destruction of the  World Trade Center  intensely, many of its newer residents having worked there. Re-zoning encouraged new construction on former industrial sites on the waterfront and the traditionally more impoverished low-lying west side of the city where, in concert with Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and New Jersey State land-use policy,  transit villages  are now being promoted. Hoboken became, and remains, a focal point in American rediscovery of urban living, and is often used as staging ground for those wishing to move to the New York/New Jersey metropolitan region.

The City of Hoboken is governed under the  Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council)  system of municipal government by a Mayor and a nine-member City Council. The City Council consists of three members elected at large from the city as a whole, and six members who each represent one of the city's six wards, all of whom are elected to four-year, staggered terms. Candidates run independent of any political party's backing. [ 23 ]   The Mayor of the City of Hoboken is  David Roberts .

Hoboken's political landscape has been shaped by a strong connection between City Hall and the citizens of Hoboken. Many of the people running for mayor / councilman were people who grew up in Hoboken.   Among the most recent elections include:     Thomas Vezzetti  vs. Steve Cappiello (1985; Vezzeti won 6,990 to 6,647)   Patrick Pasculli  vs. Joe Della Fave (1988,1989; Pasculli won)   Anthony Russo  vs. Ira Karasick (1993; Russo won 7,023 to 5,623)   David Roberts  vs.  Anthony Russo  (2001; Roberts won 6,064 to 4,759)   David Roberts  vs. Carol Marsh (2005; Roberts won 5,761 to 4,239.

Under the direction of Ms. Isabel Diaz, students train to become a licensed cosmetologist including haircutting, coloring, perming, and styling as well as manicuring, pedicuring, and facials. In addition, students learn retail cosmetic sales, and salon development and practice those skills in a model salon/lab setting. The classes are available to all students at Demarest High School.   The cosmetology program at DHS is a course of study covering all phases of cosmetology, hair care, skin care and manicuring. The curriculum is mandated by the New Jersey State Department of Education.

Today, it is one of the largest and most diverse neighborhoods in New York City and has expanded well beyond its original boundaries. Flushing's diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside here including people of European, Asian, Hispanic and African-American descent. It is part of the  Fifth Congressional District , which encompasses the entire northeastern shore of Queens County, and extends into neighboring  Nassau County . Flushing is serviced by five railroad stations on the  Long Island Rail Road   Port Washington Branch  and the  New York City Subway   Number 7 subway line  has its terminus at Main Street.   Flushing is part of  Queens Community Board 7 [ 1 ]  and is bounded by Flushing Meadows-Corona Park to the West,  Francis Lewis Boulevard  to the East, Union Turnpike to the South and Willets Point Boulevard to the North.

The village was named after the city of  Vlissingen , in the southwestern  Netherlands , the main port of the company.   In its early days, the village of Flushing was inhabited by English colonists, among them a farmer named  John Bowne . John Bowne defied a prohibition imposed by New Amsterdam Director-General  Peter Stuyvesant  on harboring Quakers by allowing  Quaker  meetings in his home. Today, landmarks from the Dutch period in Flushing include the  John Bowne House  on Bowne Street and the  Old Quaker Meeting House  on  Northern Boulevard .   The  Flushing Remonstrance , signed in Flushing on December 27, 1657, protested religious persecution and eventually led to the decision by the Dutch West India Company to allow Quakers and others to worship freely. As such, Flushing is claimed to be a birthplace of religious freedom in the new world.  [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   English colonial history   In 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, ending Dutch control of the colony, and renamed it New York. Flushing remained a small Long Island village.   Flushing was the site of the first commercial  tree nurseries  in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. Much of the northern section of  Kissena Park , former site of the Parsons nursery, still contains a wide variety of exotic trees. The naming of streets intersecting Kissena Boulevard on its way toward Kissena Park celebrates this fact (Ash Avenue, Beech, Cherry ...Poplar, Quince, Rose). Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward project, now known as  Central Park  in Manhattan.   During the American Revolution, Flushing, along with most settlements in present-day Queens County, favored the British and quartered British troops. Following the  Battle of Long Island ,  Nathan Hale , an officer in the  Continental Army , was apprehended near Flushing Bay while on what was probably an intelligence gathering mission and was later hanged.   The 1785  Kingsland Homestead , originally the residence of a wealthy  Quaker  merchant, now serves as the home of the  Queens Historical Society . [ 3 ]   The 1790 United States census recorded that 5,393 people lived in what is present-day Queens County.     [ edit ]   Nineteenth century   During the 1800s, as New York City continued to grow in population and economic strength, Flushing's proximity to Manhattan was critical to its growth and transformation to a fashionable residential area.          Map of Flushing in 1891.       In 1813, the village of Flushing was incorporated into the Town of Flushing. By the mid-1860s, Queens County had 30,429 residents. Flushing's expansion continued in 1867 and 1868 when the neighboring villages of College Point and Whitestone were incorporated into the Town of Flushing.   In 1898, although opposed to the proposal, Flushing along with a re-drawn Queens County was consolidated into the City of New York. Local farmland continued to be subdivided and developed transforming Flushing into a densely populated neighborhood of New York City.     [ edit ]   Twentieth century and World's Fairs   The continued construction of bridges over the Flushing River and the development of other roads increased the volume of vehicular traffic into Flushing. In 1909, the construction of the  Queensborough Bridge  over the  East River  connected Queens County to  midtown Manhattan .   The introduction of rail road service to Manhattan in 1910 by the  Long Island Rail Road  Port Washington Branch and in 1928 by the  New York City Transit Authority  Number 7 subway line hastened the continued transformation of Flushing to a commuter suburb and commercial center. Due to increased traffic, a main roadway through Flushing named Broadway was widened and renamed Northern Boulevard.   Flushing was a forerunner of Hollywood, when the young American film industry was still based on the East Coast and  Chicago . Decades later, the  RKO  Keith's movie palace would host  vaudeville  acts and appearances by the likes of  Mickey Rooney ,  The Marx Brothers  and  Bob Hope . The theater now lies vacant and in disrepair due to an unauthorized real estate development project that took place in the early 1990s.   The  1939-1940 World's Fair  was held in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. [ 4 ]  Massive preparations for the Fair began in 1936 and included the elimination of the Corona dumps. Among the innovations presented to the world in 1939 was the  television , which broadcast a speech by  Franklin D. Roosevelt .   After the World's Fair, the New York City pavilion was converted into the temporary headquarters of the United Nations where, in 1947, the  UN voted  in favor of the establishment of the  State of Israel .   A second World's Fair, the  1964-1965 World's Fair  was also held at the site of the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.  Pope Paul VI  attended the Fair on October 4, 1965. On this papal trip, Pope Paul VI became the first pope to visit the United States. An  exedra  now commemorates the site of the Vatican pavilion.  Michelangelo 's masterpiece, the  Piet , was exhibited during his trip.   Following the Fair, the  Unisphere , the New York State Pavilion and the New York City Pavilion remained in the park. The NYC Pavilion was converted into an ice-skating rink and later, the ice rink became the Queens Museum of Art.     [ edit ]   Landmarks, museums and cultural institutions   There are numerous historic structures located in Flushing.   Flushing Town Hall  [1]  is located on Northern Boulevard and is the headquarters of the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts. It is an affiliate of the  Smithsonian Institution  in Washington, D.C.  [ 5 ]  The building houses a concert hall and cultural center and is one of the sites designated along the Queens Historical Society's Freedom Mile  [2] .   Other registered New York City Landmarks include the  Bowne House ,  Kingsland Homestead ,  Old Quaker Meeting House  (1694),  Flushing High School , St. George's Church (1854), the  Lewis H. Latimer House , the former  RKO  Keith's movie theater, the United States Post Office on Main Street and the  Unisphere , a 12-story high, stainless steel globe that served as the centerpiece for the  1964 New York World's Fair . The Flushing Armory, on Northern Boulevard, was formerly used by the National Guard. Presently, the Queens North Task Force of the  New York City Police Department  uses this building. [ 6 ]  In 2005, the Fitzgerald-Ginsberg Mansion [3]  on Bayside Avenue and in 2007, the Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden  [4]  were designated as landmarks.          Marker of the two time capsules       Several attractions originally developed for the World's Fairs in  Flushing Meadows-Corona Park  are worth visiting. There is a stone marker for the two 5,000-year  Westinghouse Time Capsules  made of special  alloys  buried in the park, chronicling 20th Century life in the United States dedicated both in 1938 and 1965. Also located in the park are the  Queens Museum of Art  which features a scale model of the City of New York, the largest architectural model ever built; Queens Theatre in the Park  [5] ; the  New York Hall of Science  and the  Queens Zoo .   The  Queens Botanical Garden  located on Main Street, has been in operation continuously since its opening as an exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair. The Botanical Garden carries on Flushing's nearly three centuries long horticultural tradition, dating back to its once famed tree nurseries and seed farms.     [ edit ]   Demographics   The 2000 United States Census Bureau ranked Queens County as the ninth most populous county in the United States with over 2.2 million residents. According to the Census Bureau, Queens County experienced over a 14% increase in population since the 1990 census.   The 2000 Census also reflected the growth of the  Asian American  population in Queens County with over 391,500 people identifying themselves as Asian Americans, it has garnered the nickname ""Little Korea"". That number was the largest in New York City, more than twice the number of people identifying themselves as  Asian-American  in Brooklyn. The 2000 Census revealed that the 5th Congressional District had almost 655,000 residents. Approximately 364,200 residents or 55% of the District identified themselves as white. A total of 160,896 residents or 25% of the District identified themselves as Asian Americans and 153,721 or 24% identified themselves as Hispanic.   [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Religion   Flushing is a very religiously diverse community in America (if not the most). There are ""over 200 places of worship in a small urban neighborhood about 2.5 square miles [6.5 square kilometers]."" [ 9 ]  ""Flushing has become a model for religious pluralism in America, says R. Scott Hanson, a visiting assistant professor of history at the State University of New York at Binghamton and an affiliate of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University."" [ 10 ]   In 1657, while Flushing was still a Dutch settlement, a document known as the  Flushing Remonstrance  was created by Edward Hart, the town clerk, where some thirty ordinary citizens protested a ban imposed by Peter Stuyvesant, the director general of New Amsterdam, forbidding the harboring of Quakers. The Flushing Remonstrance cited the Flushing Town charter of 1645 which promised liberty of conscience. [ 11 ]   Today, Flushing abounds in houses of worship, ranging from the Dutch colonial epoch Quaker Meeting House, St. George's Episcopal Church, the Free Synagogue of Flushing, St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - the largest Greek Orthodox Church in the United States. The New York Times     [ edit ]   Ethnic culture          Roosevelt Avenue is one of the main commercial streets in Flushing.       The intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, the business center for Flushing located at the terminus of the Number 7 subway line on the westernmost edge of the neighborhood has a concentration of Chinese and Korean small businesses among others. Today, this area is also known for its selection of authentic Chinese, Korean and Asian restaurants.   Other areas of Flushing continue to maintain a large Italian and Greek presence reflected in the many Italian and Greek bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants in the northern and eastern sections of the neighborhood.   An area south of Franklin Avenue is home to an Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi market. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Neighborhoods   Broadway-Flushing , also known as North Flushing, is a residential area with many large homes. Part of this area has been designated a State and Federal historic district due to the elegant, park-like character of the neighborhood. Recently much of the area was rezoned by the City of New York to preserve the low density, residential quality of the area. The neighborhood awaits designation as an Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Broadway-Flushing is bounded by 29 th  Avenue to the north, Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue to the south, 155 st  to the west and 172 nd  Streets to the east.

For Queens County, the Department of Parks and Recreation is headquartered at The Overlook in Forest Park located in Kew Gardens.     Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , a 1,255-acre (5.08 km 2 ) park, is considered a flagship park in Queens. The site hosted two World's Fairs, the first in 1939-1940 and the second in 1964-1965. As the result, the park infrastructure reflects the construction undertaken for the Fairs. Also located here is Citi Field and the National Tennis Center which is the home of the US Tennis Open.

Murchison in the  Beaux-Arts style , the  rail  and  ferry  terminal buildings were constructed in 1907 as the  Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad  Terminal Complex. The terminal building is listed on the State Register and the  National Register of Historic Places  (added in 1973 as #73001102). [ 1 ]   The large main  waiting room , with its floral and  Greek Revival  motifs in tiled stained glass by  Louis Comfort Tiffany  set atop bands of pale cement, is generally considered one of the finest in the U.S. aesthetically. The terminal exterior extends to over four stories and has a distinguished copper-clad faade with ornate detailing. Its single-story base is constructed of rusticated Indiana limestone. A grand double stair with decorative cast-iron railings within the main waiting room provides an entrance to the upper-level ferry concourse.   The terminal is considered a milestone in American transportation development, combining rail, ferry, tram (later, bus; even later, bus on one side and light-rail on the other), and pedestrian facilities in one of the most innovatively designed and engineered structures in the nation. Hoboken Terminal was also one of the first stations in the world to employ the Bush-type  train shed , which quickly became ubiquitous with station design.   Hoboken Terminal, like Hoboken itself, is a place of ""firsts"". One year before his death,  Thomas Edison  was at the controls for the first departure, in 1930, of a regular-service  electrified train  from Hoboken Terminal to  Montclair, New Jersey . The first installation of central  air-conditioning  in a public space was at Hoboken Terminal, as was the first non-experimental use of  mobile phones . [ 2 ]   The station is unusual for a modern major commuter railroad terminal in that it still makes use of low-level platforms, which require passengers to make use of stairs on the train to board and disembark.   The station has been used for film shoots, including  Funny Girl ,  Once Upon a Time in America , Three Days of the Condor ,  The Station Agent  and  Eric Clapton 's video for his 1996 single "" Change the World "".   A 225-foot (69 m) clock tower was originally built with the terminal over a century ago, but was dismantled in the early 1950s due to structural damage and deterioration from weather damage. A new clock tower, replicating the original, was constructed during the terminal's centennial year of 2007 and was fully erect that November. The replica tower has four foot high copper letters spelling out ""LACKAWANNA"", which are lit at night.     [ edit ]   Services   Hoboken is served by the most rail routes in the entire New Jersey Transit system, including light rail.

Access to the PATH tracks is from the north side of the concourse or the adjacent street. Service is provided 24 hours a day, along the following routes:     Hoboken-33rd Street   Hoboken-World Trade Center   Journal Square-33rd Street (via Hoboken)  (late night & weekend service)       [ edit ]   Hudson-Bergen Light Rail   Hoboken Terminal is the terminus for two of the three  Hudson-Bergen Light Rail  services. The Hoboken Terminal-Tonnelle Avenue service to  North Bergen  and the 22nd Street-Hoboken Terminal service to  Bayonne  (including Bayonne Flyer service) both operate from tracks on the south side of the terminal area. The West Side Avenue-Tonnelle Avenue service bypasses Hoboken Terminal, requiring passengers from stations on the West Side Branch to transfer at stations between  Pavonia-Newport  and  Liberty State Park .     [ edit ]   BillyBey Ferry Company   Passengers can connect to  BillyBey  ferries headed to the  World Financial Center  in  Battery Park City  or the  Wall Street  Ferry Pier in the  Financial District  on weekdays only.

Today, it is one of the largest and most diverse neighborhoods in New York City and has expanded well beyond its original boundaries. Flushing's diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside here including people of European, Asian, Hispanic and African-American descent. It is part of the  Fifth Congressional District , which encompasses the entire northeastern shore of Queens County, and extends into neighboring  Nassau County . Flushing is serviced by five railroad stations on the  Long Island Rail Road   Port Washington Branch  and the  New York City Subway   Number 7 subway line  has its terminus at Main Street.   Flushing is part of  Queens Community Board 7 [ 1 ]  and is bounded by Flushing Meadows-Corona Park to the West,  Francis Lewis Boulevard  to the East, Union Turnpike to the South and Willets Point Boulevard to the North.

The village was named after the city of  Vlissingen , in the southwestern  Netherlands , the main port of the company.   In its early days, the village of Flushing was inhabited by English colonists, among them a farmer named  John Bowne . John Bowne defied a prohibition imposed by New Amsterdam Director-General  Peter Stuyvesant  on harboring Quakers by allowing  Quaker  meetings in his home. Today, landmarks from the Dutch period in Flushing include the  John Bowne House  on Bowne Street and the  Old Quaker Meeting House  on  Northern Boulevard .   The  Flushing Remonstrance , signed in Flushing on December 27, 1657, protested religious persecution and eventually led to the decision by the Dutch West India Company to allow Quakers and others to worship freely. As such, Flushing is claimed to be a birthplace of religious freedom in the new world.  [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   English colonial history   In 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, ending Dutch control of the colony, and renamed it New York. Flushing remained a small Long Island village.   Flushing was the site of the first commercial  tree nurseries  in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. Much of the northern section of  Kissena Park , former site of the Parsons nursery, still contains a wide variety of exotic trees. The naming of streets intersecting Kissena Boulevard on its way toward Kissena Park celebrates this fact (Ash Avenue, Beech, Cherry ...Poplar, Quince, Rose). Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward project, now known as  Central Park  in Manhattan.   During the American Revolution, Flushing, along with most settlements in present-day Queens County, favored the British and quartered British troops. Following the  Battle of Long Island ,  Nathan Hale , an officer in the  Continental Army , was apprehended near Flushing Bay while on what was probably an intelligence gathering mission and was later hanged.   The 1785  Kingsland Homestead , originally the residence of a wealthy  Quaker  merchant, now serves as the home of the  Queens Historical Society . [ 3 ]   The 1790 United States census recorded that 5,393 people lived in what is present-day Queens County.     [ edit ]   Nineteenth century   During the 1800s, as New York City continued to grow in population and economic strength, Flushing's proximity to Manhattan was critical to its growth and transformation to a fashionable residential area.          Map of Flushing in 1891.       In 1813, the village of Flushing was incorporated into the Town of Flushing. By the mid-1860s, Queens County had 30,429 residents. Flushing's expansion continued in 1867 and 1868 when the neighboring villages of College Point and Whitestone were incorporated into the Town of Flushing.   In 1898, although opposed to the proposal, Flushing along with a re-drawn Queens County was consolidated into the City of New York. Local farmland continued to be subdivided and developed transforming Flushing into a densely populated neighborhood of New York City.     [ edit ]   Twentieth century and World's Fairs   The continued construction of bridges over the Flushing River and the development of other roads increased the volume of vehicular traffic into Flushing. In 1909, the construction of the  Queensborough Bridge  over the  East River  connected Queens County to  midtown Manhattan .   The introduction of rail road service to Manhattan in 1910 by the  Long Island Rail Road  Port Washington Branch and in 1928 by the  New York City Transit Authority  Number 7 subway line hastened the continued transformation of Flushing to a commuter suburb and commercial center. Due to increased traffic, a main roadway through Flushing named Broadway was widened and renamed Northern Boulevard.   Flushing was a forerunner of Hollywood, when the young American film industry was still based on the East Coast and  Chicago . Decades later, the  RKO  Keith's movie palace would host  vaudeville  acts and appearances by the likes of  Mickey Rooney ,  The Marx Brothers  and  Bob Hope . The theater now lies vacant and in disrepair due to an unauthorized real estate development project that took place in the early 1990s.   The  1939-1940 World's Fair  was held in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. [ 4 ]  Massive preparations for the Fair began in 1936 and included the elimination of the Corona dumps. Among the innovations presented to the world in 1939 was the  television , which broadcast a speech by  Franklin D. Roosevelt .   After the World's Fair, the New York City pavilion was converted into the temporary headquarters of the United Nations where, in 1947, the  UN voted  in favor of the establishment of the  State of Israel .   A second World's Fair, the  1964-1965 World's Fair  was also held at the site of the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.  Pope Paul VI  attended the Fair on October 4, 1965. On this papal trip, Pope Paul VI became the first pope to visit the United States. An  exedra  now commemorates the site of the Vatican pavilion.  Michelangelo 's masterpiece, the  Piet , was exhibited during his trip.   Following the Fair, the  Unisphere , the New York State Pavilion and the New York City Pavilion remained in the park. The NYC Pavilion was converted into an ice-skating rink and later, the ice rink became the Queens Museum of Art.     [ edit ]   Landmarks, museums and cultural institutions   There are numerous historic structures located in Flushing.   Flushing Town Hall  [1]  is located on Northern Boulevard and is the headquarters of the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts. It is an affiliate of the  Smithsonian Institution  in Washington, D.C.  [ 5 ]  The building houses a concert hall and cultural center and is one of the sites designated along the Queens Historical Society's Freedom Mile  [2] .   Other registered New York City Landmarks include the  Bowne House ,  Kingsland Homestead ,  Old Quaker Meeting House  (1694),  Flushing High School , St. George's Church (1854), the  Lewis H. Latimer House , the former  RKO  Keith's movie theater, the United States Post Office on Main Street and the  Unisphere , a 12-story high, stainless steel globe that served as the centerpiece for the  1964 New York World's Fair . The Flushing Armory, on Northern Boulevard, was formerly used by the National Guard. Presently, the Queens North Task Force of the  New York City Police Department  uses this building. [ 6 ]  In 2005, the Fitzgerald-Ginsberg Mansion [3]  on Bayside Avenue and in 2007, the Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden  [4]  were designated as landmarks.          Marker of the two time capsules       Several attractions originally developed for the World's Fairs in  Flushing Meadows-Corona Park  are worth visiting. There is a stone marker for the two 5,000-year  Westinghouse Time Capsules  made of special  alloys  buried in the park, chronicling 20th Century life in the United States dedicated both in 1938 and 1965. Also located in the park are the  Queens Museum of Art  which features a scale model of the City of New York, the largest architectural model ever built; Queens Theatre in the Park  [5] ; the  New York Hall of Science  and the  Queens Zoo .   The  Queens Botanical Garden  located on Main Street, has been in operation continuously since its opening as an exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair. The Botanical Garden carries on Flushing's nearly three centuries long horticultural tradition, dating back to its once famed tree nurseries and seed farms.     [ edit ]   Demographics   The 2000 United States Census Bureau ranked Queens County as the ninth most populous county in the United States with over 2.2 million residents. According to the Census Bureau, Queens County experienced over a 14% increase in population since the 1990 census.   The 2000 Census also reflected the growth of the  Asian American  population in Queens County with over 391,500 people identifying themselves as Asian Americans, it has garnered the nickname ""Little Korea"". That number was the largest in New York City, more than twice the number of people identifying themselves as  Asian-American  in Brooklyn. The 2000 Census revealed that the 5th Congressional District had almost 655,000 residents. Approximately 364,200 residents or 55% of the District identified themselves as white. A total of 160,896 residents or 25% of the District identified themselves as Asian Americans and 153,721 or 24% identified themselves as Hispanic.   [ 7 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Religion   Flushing is a very religiously diverse community in America (if not the most). There are ""over 200 places of worship in a small urban neighborhood about 2.5 square miles [6.5 square kilometers]."" [ 9 ]  ""Flushing has become a model for religious pluralism in America, says R. Scott Hanson, a visiting assistant professor of history at the State University of New York at Binghamton and an affiliate of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University."" [ 10 ]   In 1657, while Flushing was still a Dutch settlement, a document known as the  Flushing Remonstrance  was created by Edward Hart, the town clerk, where some thirty ordinary citizens protested a ban imposed by Peter Stuyvesant, the director general of New Amsterdam, forbidding the harboring of Quakers. The Flushing Remonstrance cited the Flushing Town charter of 1645 which promised liberty of conscience. [ 11 ]   Today, Flushing abounds in houses of worship, ranging from the Dutch colonial epoch Quaker Meeting House, St. George's Episcopal Church, the Free Synagogue of Flushing, St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - the largest Greek Orthodox Church in the United States. The New York Times     [ edit ]   Ethnic culture          Roosevelt Avenue is one of the main commercial streets in Flushing.       The intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, the business center for Flushing located at the terminus of the Number 7 subway line on the westernmost edge of the neighborhood has a concentration of Chinese and Korean small businesses among others. Today, this area is also known for its selection of authentic Chinese, Korean and Asian restaurants.   Other areas of Flushing continue to maintain a large Italian and Greek presence reflected in the many Italian and Greek bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants in the northern and eastern sections of the neighborhood.   An area south of Franklin Avenue is home to an Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi market. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Neighborhoods   Broadway-Flushing , also known as North Flushing, is a residential area with many large homes. Part of this area has been designated a State and Federal historic district due to the elegant, park-like character of the neighborhood. Recently much of the area was rezoned by the City of New York to preserve the low density, residential quality of the area. The neighborhood awaits designation as an Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Broadway-Flushing is bounded by 29 th  Avenue to the north, Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue to the south, 155 st  to the west and 172 nd  Streets to the east. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Parks   All the public parks and playgrounds in Flushing are supervised by the  New York City Department of Parks and Recreation . For Queens County, the Department of Parks and Recreation is headquartered at The Overlook in Forest Park located in Kew Gardens.     Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , a 1,255-acre (5.08 km 2 ) park, is considered a flagship park in Queens. The site hosted two World's Fairs, the first in 1939-1940 and the second in 1964-1965. As the result, the park infrastructure reflects the construction undertaken for the Fairs. Also located here is Citi Field and the National Tennis Center which is the home of the US Tennis Open. In 2008, a new Aquatic Center was opened in the park [6] .       Kissena Park  is a 234-acre (0.95 km 2 ) park with a lake as a centerpiece.

Hoboken lies on the west bank of the  Hudson River  across from the  Manhattan ,  New York City  neighborhoods of the  West Village  and  Chelsea  between  Weehawken Cove  and  Union City  at the north and  Jersey City  (the county seat) at the south and west.   According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 5.1 km (2.0 mi). 3.3 km (1.3 mi) of it is land and 1.8 km (0.7 mi) of it is water. The total area is 35.35% water.   Hoboken has 48 streets laid out in a grid, with numbered streets running east-west. Many north-south streets were named for US presidents (Washington, Adams, Madison, Monroe), though Clinton Street likely honors 19th century politician  DeWitt Clinton .   Hoboken's  zip code  is 07030 and its  area code  is  201  with  551   overlaid .

The  population density  is 11,636.5/km (30,239.2/mi), fourth highest in the nation after neighboring communities of  Guttenberg ,  Union City  and  West New York . [ 9 ]  There are 19,915 housing units at an average density of 6,007.2/km (15,610.7/mi). The racial makeup of the city is 80.82%  White , 4.26%  African American , 0.16%  Native American , 4.31%  Asian , 0.05%  Pacific Islander , 7.63% from  other races , and 2.78% from two or more races. Furthermore 20.18% of those residents also consider themselves to be  Hispanic  or  Latino .   There are 19,418 households out of which 11.4% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 23.8% are  married couples  living together, 9.0% have a female householder with no husband present, and 64.8% are non-families. 41.8% of all households are made up of individuals and 8.0% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 1.92 and the average family size is 2.73.   In the city the population is spread out with 10.5% under the age of 18, 15.3% from 18 to 24, 51.7% from 25 to 44, 13.5% from 45 to 64, and 9.0% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 30 years. For every 100 females, age 18 and over, there are 103.9 males.   The median income for a household in the city as of the last census was $62,550, while the median income for a family was $67,500 (these figures had risen to $96,786 and $107,375 respectively as of a 2007 estimate [ 10 ] ). Males had a median income of $54,870 versus $46,826 for females. The  per capita income  for the city was $43,195. 11.0% of the population and 10.0% of families are below the  poverty line . Out of the total population, 23.6% of those under the age of 18 and 20.7% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.   The city is a  bedroom community  of  New York City , where most of its employed residents work. [ 11 ]  Up to 25% of the population (as of 2008) works in finance or real estate. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The name ""Hoboken"" was decided upon by  Colonel John Stevens  when he purchased land, on a part of which the city still sits.          100 block of Washington Street              Newark Street looking west       It's believed that the  Lenape  (later called  Delaware Indian ) referred to the area as the land of the tobacco pipe, most likely to refer to the  soapstone  collected there to carve  tobacco pipes , and used a phrase that became Hopoghan Hackingh. [ 13 ]   The first Europeans to live there were  Dutch / Flemish  settlers to  New Netherlands  or  Novo Belgio [ 14 ] , who may have bastardized the Lenape phrase, though there is no known written documentation to confirm it. It also cannot be confirmed that the American Hoboken is named after the Flemish town  Hoboken , annexed in 1983 to  Antwerp ,  Belgium , [ 15 ]  whose name is derived from Middle Dutch  Hooghe Buechen  or  Hoge Beuken , meaning  High  Beeches  or  Tall Beeches . [ 16 ]  The city has also been cited as having been named after the  Van Hoboken  family of the 17th-century estate in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where there is still a square dedicated to them. It is not known what the area was called in  Jersey Dutch , a Dutch-variant language based on  Zeelandic  and Flemish, with English and possibly Lenape influences, spoken in northern New Jersey during the 18th and 19th centuries.   Like  Weehawken , its neighbor to the north, Communipaw and Harisimus to the south, Hoboken had variations in the folks-tongue of the period.  Hoebuck , old Dutch for high bluff and likely referring to Castle Point, was used during the colonial era and later spelled in English as  Hobuck , [ 17 ]   Hobock , [ 18 ]  and  Hoboocken . [ 19 ]   Hoboken's unofficial nickname is now the ""Mile Square City"", but it actually covers an area of two square miles when including the under-water parts in the Hudson River. During the late 19th/early 20th century the population and culture of Hoboken was dominated by German language speakers who sometimes called it ""Little Bremen"", many of whom are buried in  Hoboken Cemetery, North Bergen .   The term "" hobo "" (i.e., a railroad journeyman) is believed to have stemmed from the groups of hobos traveling by railroad from Hoboken.

Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (January 2009)         [ edit ]   Early and colonial   Hoboken was originally an island, surrounded by the Hudson River on the east and tidal lands at the foot of the  New Jersey Palisades  on the west. It was a seasonal campsite in the territory of the  Hackensack , a sub-group of  Lenni Lenape  called  Unami , whose totem was the turtle. Later called  Delaware Indian , the Lenape are believed to have lived for more than 2800 years on lands around and in-between the Hudson and  Delaware Rivers . The first European to lay claim the area was  Henry Hudson , an Englishman sailing for the  Dutch East India Company , who anchored his ship the  Halve Maen  ( Half Moon ) at  Weehawken Cove  on  October 2 ,  1609 . The United New Netherland Company was created to manage this new territory and in June of 1623,  New Netherland  or  Novo Belgio [ 20 ]  became a Dutch colony. In 1630,  Michael Pauw , a burgemeester (mayor) of  Amsterdam  and a director of the  West India Company , received a land grant as  patroon  on the condition that he would plant a colony of not fewer than fifty persons within four years on the west bank of what had been named the  North River . Three  Lenape  sold the land that is was to become Hoboken (and part of Jersey City) for 80 fathoms (146 m) of  wampum , 20 fathoms (37 m) of cloth, 12 kettles, six guns, two blankets, one double kettle and half a barrel of beer. These transactions, variously dated as July 12, 1630 and November 22, 1630, represent the earliest known conveyance for the area. Pauw (whose Latinized name is  Pavonia ) neglected to settle the land and he was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633. It was later acquired by  Hendrick Van Vorst , who leased part of the land to  Aert Van Putten , a farmer. In 1643, north of what would be later known as Castle Point, Van Putten built a house and a brewery, North Americas first. In series of Indian and Dutch raids and reprisals, Van Putten was killed and his buildings destroyed, and all residents of Pavonia (as the colony was known) were ordered back to New Amsterdam. Deteriorating relations with the Lenape, its isolation as an island, or relatively long distance from New Amsterdam may have discouraged more settlement. In 1664, the English took possession of  New Amsterdam  with little or no resistance, and in 1668 they confirmed a previous land patent of by Nicolas Verlett. In 1674-75 the area became part of  East Jersey , and he province was divided into four administrative districts, Hoboken becoming part of  Bergen County , where it remained until the creation of Hudson on  February 22 ,  1840 . English-speaking settlers (some relocating from New England) interspersed with the Dutch, but it remained scarcely populated and agrarian. Eventually, the land came into the possession of  William Bayard , who originally supported the revolutionary cause, but became a  Loyalist Tory  after the fall of New York in 1776 when the city and surrounding areas, including the west bank of the re-named Hudson River, were occupied by the British. At the end of the  Revolutionary War , Bayards property was confiscated by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey. In 1784, the land described as ""William Bayard's farm at Hoebuck"" was bought at auction by Colonel  John Stevens  for 18,360 pounds sterling.     [ edit ]   The 19th century          Ferry slips at Terminal              The  Hudson River  during the 1880s, offshore from Hoboken and  Jersey City .       In the early 1800s, Colonel  John Stevens  developed the waterfront as a resort for Manhattanites, a lucrative source of income, which he may have used for testing his many mechanical  inventions . On October 11, 1811 Stevens' ship the  Juliana , began operation as the world's first  steam -powered  ferry  with service between Manhattan and Hoboken. In 1825, he designed and built a  steam locomotive  capable of hauling several passenger cars at his estate. In 1832,  Sybil's Cave  opened as an attraction serving spring water, and after 1841 became a legend, when  Edgar Allan Poe  wrote "" The Mystery of Marie Roget "" about an event that took place there. (In the late 1880s, when the water was found to be contaminated, it was shut and in the 1930s, filled with concrete.) Before his death in 1838, Stevens founded  The Hoboken Land Improvement Company , which during the mid- and late-19th century was managed by his heirs and laid out a regular system of streets, blocks and lots, constructed housing, and developed manufacturing sites. In general, the housing consisted of masonry row houses of three to five stories, some of which survive to the present day, as does the street grid. The advantages of Hoboken as a shipping port and industrial center became apparent.   Hoboken was originally formed as a  township  on  April 9 ,  1849 , from portions of  North Bergen Township . As the town grew in population and employment, many of Hoboken's residents saw a need to incorporate as a full-fledged city, and in a referendum held on  March 29 ,  1855 , ratified an Act of the  New Jersey Legislature  signed the previous day, and the City of Hoboken was born. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  In the subsequent election, Cornelius V. Clickener became  Hoboken's first mayor . On  March 15 ,  1859 , the Township of Weehawken was created from portions of Hoboken and  North Bergen Township . [ 21 ]   In 1870, based on a bequest from  Edwin A. Stevens ,  Stevens Institute of Technology  was founded at  Castle Point , site of the Stevens family's former estate. By the late 1800s, great shipping lines were using Hoboken as a terminal port, and the  Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad  (later the  Erie Lackawanna Railroad ] developed a railroad terminal at the waterfront. It was also during this time that  German   immigrants , who had been settling in town during most of the century, became the predominant population group in the city, at least partially due to its being a major destination port of the  Hamburg America Line . In addition to the primary industry of shipbuilding, Hoboken became home to  Keuffel and Esser 's three-story factory and in 1884, to  Tietjan and Lang Drydock  (later Todd Shipyards). Well-known companies that developed a major presence in Hoboken after the turn-of the-century included  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea , and  Hostess .     [ edit ]   Birthplace of baseball          Early baseball game played at  Elysian Fields , Hoboken (Currier & Ives lithograph).       The first officially recorded game of  baseball  in US history took place in Hoboken in 1846  [ 23 ]  between  Knickerbocker Club  and  New York Nine  at  Elysian Fields .   In 1845, the  Knickerbocker Club , which had been founded by Alexander Cartwright, began using  Elysian Fields  to play  baseball  due to the lack of suitable grounds on  Manhattan . [ 24 ]  Team members included players of the St George's Cricket Club, the brothers Harry and George Wright, and Henry Chadwick, the English-born journalist who coined the term ""America's Pastime"".   By the 1850s, several  Manhattan -based members of the  National Association of Base Ball Players  were using the grounds as their home field while St George's continued to organize international matches between Canada, England and the United States at the same venue. In 1859, Jack Parr's All England Eleven of professional cricketers played the United States XXII at Hoboken, easily defeating the local competition. Sam Wright and his sons Harry and George Wright played on the defeated United States team-a loss which inadvertently encouraged local players to take up baseball. Henry Chadwick believed that baseball and not cricket should become America's pastime after the game drawing the conclusion that amateur American players did not have the leisure time required to develop cricket skills to the high technical level required of professional players. Harry and George Wright then became two of America's first professional baseball players when Aaron Champion raised funds to found the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869.   In 1865 the grounds hosted a championship match between the  Mutual Club  of  New York  and the  Atlantic Club  of  Brooklyn  that was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured in the  Currier & Ives   lithograph  ""The American National Game of Base Ball"".   With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences in  Brooklyn , enabling promoters there to charge admission to games, the prominence of  Elysian Fields  diminished. In 1868 the leading  Manhattan  club,  Mutual , shifted its home games to the  Union Grounds  in  Brooklyn . In 1880, the founders of the  New York Metropolitans  and  New York Giants  finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan that became known as the  Polo Grounds .     [ edit ]   ""Heaven, Hell or Hoboken""   When the USA decided to enter World War I the  Hamburg-American Line  piers in Hoboken (and New Orleans) were taken under  eminent domain . Federal control of the port and anti-German sentiment led to part of the city being placed under martial law, and many Germans were forcibly moved to  Ellis Island  or left the city altogether. Hoboken became the major point of embarkation and more than three million soldiers, known as "" doughboys "", passed through the city. Their hope for an early return led to  General Pershing 's slogan, "" Heaven ,  Hell  or Hoboken... by  Christmas .""     [ edit ]   Interwar years   Following the war,  Italians , mostly stemming from the  Adriatic  port city of  Molfetta , became the city's major ethnic group, with the  Irish  also having a strong presence. While the city experienced the Depression, jobs in the ships yards and factories were still available, and the ""tenements"" were full. Middle-European Jews, mostly German-speaking, also made their way to the city and established small businesses. The  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  was established on  April 30 ,  1921 . The  Holland Tunnel  was completed in 1927 and the  Lincoln Tunnel  in (1937), allowing for easier vehicular travel between New Jersey and  New York City , bypassing the waterfront.     [ edit ]   Post-World War II   The war provided a shot in the arm for Hoboken as the many industries located in the city were crucial to the war effort. As men went off to battle, more women were hired in the factories, some (most notably,  Todd Shipyards ), offering classes and other incentives to them. Though some returning service men took advantage of GI housing bills, many with strong ethnic and familial ties chose to stay in town. During the fifties, the economy was still driven by  Todd Shipyards ,  Maxwell House ,  Lipton Tea ,  Hostess  and  Bethlehem Steel  and companies with big plants still not inclined to invest in huge infrastructure elsewhere. Unions were powerful and the pay was good.   By the sixties, though, things began to disintegrate: turn-of-the century housing started to look shabby and feel crowded, shipbuilding was cheaper overseas, and single-story plants surrounded by parking lots made manufacturing and distribution more economical than old brick buildings on congested urban streets. The city appeared to be in the throes of inexorable decline as industries sought (what had been) greener pastures, port operations shifted to larger facilities on  Newark Bay , and the car, truck and plane displaced the railroad and ship as the transportation modes of choice in the United States. Many Hobokenites headed to the suburbs, often the close-by ones in  Bergen  and  Passaic  Counties, and real-estate values declined. Hoboken sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a rundown condition and was often included in lists with other New Jersey cities experiencing the same phenomenon, such as  Paterson ,  Elizabeth ,  Camden , and neighboring  Jersey City .   The old economic underpinnings were gone and nothing new seemed to be on the horizon. Attempts were made to stabilize the population by demolishing the so-called slums along River Street and build subsidized middle-income housing at Marineview Plaza, and in midtown, at Church Towers. Heaps of long uncollected garbage and roving packs of semi-wild dogs were not uncommon sights. [ 25 ]  Though the city had seen better days, Hoboken was never abandoned. New infusions of immigrants, most notably  Puerto Ricans , kept the storefronts open with small businesses and housing stock from being abandoned, but there wasn't much work to be had. Washington Street, commonly called ""the avenue"", was never boarded up, and the tightly-knit neighborhoods remained home to many who were still proud of their city. Stevens stayed a premiere technology school, Maxwell House kept chugging away, and Bethlehem Steel still housed sailors who were dry-docked on its piers. Italian-Americans and other came back to the ""old neighborhood"" to shop for delicatessen. Some streets were ""iffy"", but most were not pulled in at night.     [ edit ]   On the Waterfront   The waterfront defined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from the mid-19th to mid-20th century, by which time it had become essentially industrial (and mostly inaccessible to the general public). The large production plants of  Lipton Tea  and  Maxwell House , and the  drydocks  of  Bethlehem Steel  dominated the northern portion for many years. The southern portion (which had been a US base of the  Hamburg-American Line ) was seized by the federal government under  eminent domain  at outbreak of  World War I , after which it became (with the rest of the Hudson County) a major East Coast cargo-shipping port.  On the Waterfront , consistently listed among the five best American films ever, was shot in Hoboken, dramatically highlighting the rough and tumble lives of  longshoremen  and the infiltration of unions by organized crime.   With the construction of the  interstate highway  system and  containerization  shipping facilities (particularly at  Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal ), the docks became obsolete, and by the 1970s were more or less abandoned. A large swathe of River Street, known as the  Barbary Coast  for its taverns and boarding houses (which had been home for many dockworkers, sailors, merchant marines, and other seamen) was leveled as part of an  urban renewal  project. Though control of the confiscated area had been returned to the city in the 1950s, complex lease agreements with the  Port Authority  gave it little influence on its management. In the 1980s, the waterfront dominated Hoboken politics, with various civic groups and the city government engaging in sometimes nasty, sometimes absurd politics and court cases. By the 1990s, agreements were made with the  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , various levels of government, Hoboken citizens, and private developers to build commercial and residential buildings and ""open spaces"" (mostly along the bulkhead and on the foundation of un-utilized  Pier A ).          Panorama of Manhattan from Pier A.       The northern portion, which had remained in private hands, has also been re-developed. While most of the dry-dock and production facilities were razed to make way for mid-rise apartment houses, many sold as investment ""condos"", some buildings were renovated for adaptive re-use (notably the Tea Building, formerly home to Lipton Tea, and the Machine House, home of the Hoboken Historic Museum). Zoning requires that new construction follow the street grid and limits the height of new construction to retain the architectural character of the city and open sight-lines to the river. Downtown,  Sinatra Park  and  Sinatra Drive  honor the man most consider to be Hoboken's most famous son, while uptown the name Maxwell recalls the factory with its smell of roasting coffee wafting over town and its huge neon ""Good to the Last Drop"" sign, so long a part of the landscape. The midtown section is dominated by the  serpentine rock  outcropping atop of which sits  Stevens Institute of Technology  (which also owns some, as yet, un-developed land on the river). At the foot of the cliff is  Sybil's Cave  (where 19th century day-trippers once came to ""take the waters"" from a natural spring), long sealed shut, though plans for its restoration are in place. The promenade along the river bank is part of the  Hudson River Waterfront Walkway , a state-mandated master plan to connect the municipalities from the  Bayonne Bridge  to  George Washington Bridge  and provide contiguous unhindered access to the water's edge and to create an urban linear park offering expansive views of the Hudson with the spectacular backdrop of the New York skyline.     [ edit ]   Pre- and post-millennium   During the late 1970s and 1980s, the city witnessed a speculation spree, fueled by transplanted New Yorkers and others who bought many turn-of-the-century brownstones in neighborhoods that the still solid middle and working class population had kept intact and by local and out-of-town real-estate investors who bought up late 19th century apartment houses often considered to be tenements. Hoboken experienced a wave of fires, some of which proved to be arson.  Applied Housing , a real-estate investment firm, took advantage of US government incentives to renovate ""sub-standard"" housing and receive subsidized rental payments (commonly know as  Section 8 ), which enabled some low-income, displaced, and disabled residents to move within town. Hoboken attracted artists, musicians, upwardly-mobile commuters (known as yuppies), and ""bohemian types"" interested in the socio-economic possibilities and challenges of a bankrupt New York and who valued the aesthetics of Hoboken's residential, civic and commercial architecture, its sense of community, and relatively (compared to Lower Manhattan) cheaper rents, and quick, train hop away.  Maxwell's  (a live music venue and restaurant) opened and Hoboken became a ""hip"" place to live. Amid this social upheaval, so-called ""newcomers"" displaced some of the ""old-timers"" in the eastern half of the city.   This  gentrification  resembled that of parts of  Brooklyn  and downtown  Jersey City  and Manhattan's  East Village , (and to a lesser degree,  SoHo  and  TriBeCa , which previously had not been residential). The initial presence of artists and young people changed the perception of the place such that others who would not have considered moving there before perceived it as an interesting, safe, exciting, and eventually, desirable. The process continued as many suburbanites, transplanted Americans, internationals, and immigrants (most focused on opportunities in NY/NJ region and proximity to Manhattan) began to make the ""Jersey"" side of the Hudson their home, and the ""real-estate boom"" of the era encouraged many to seek investment opportunities. Empty lots were built on, tenements became condominiums. Hoboken felt the impact of the destruction of the  World Trade Center  intensely, many of its newer residents having worked there. Re-zoning encouraged new construction on former industrial sites on the waterfront and the traditionally more impoverished low-lying west side of the city where, in concert with Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and New Jersey State land-use policy,  transit villages  are now being promoted. Hoboken became, and remains, a focal point in American rediscovery of urban living, and is often used as staging ground for those wishing to move to the New York/New Jersey metropolitan region.     [ edit ]   Government     [ edit ]   Local government          Hoboken City Hall, on Washington Street between First Street and Newark Street.       The City of Hoboken is governed under the  Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council)  system of municipal government by a Mayor and a nine-member City Council. The City Council consists of three members elected at large from the city as a whole, and six members who each represent one of the city's six wards, all of whom are elected to four-year, staggered terms. Candidates run independent of any political party's backing. [ 26 ]   The Mayor of the City of Hoboken is  David Roberts . [ 27 ]  Members of the City Council are: [ 28 ] [ 29 ]     1st Ward:  Theresa Castallano   6th Ward:  Nino Giacchi  (Council President)   At-Large:  Terry LaBruno  (Council Vice-President)   At-Large:  Peter Cammarano   At-Large:  Ruben Ramos Jr.   2nd Ward:  Beth Mason   3rd Ward:  Michael Russo   4th Ward: Dawn Zimmer   5th Ward: Peter Cunningham         [ edit ]   Mayoral election history   During Hoboken's 150 year history as an incorporated city, the elections that have been held for  Mayor of Hoboken  and members of the Hoboken city council have been largely operated by Hoboken's community. Hoboken's political landscape has been shaped by a strong connection between City Hall and the citizens of Hoboken. Many of the people running for mayor / councilman were people who grew up in Hoboken.   Among the most recent elections include:     Thomas Vezzetti  vs. Steve Cappiello (1985; Vezzeti won 6,990 to 6,647)   Patrick Pasculli  vs. Joe Della Fave (1988,1989; Pasculli won)   Anthony Russo  vs. Ira Karasick (1993; Russo won 7,023 to 5,623)   David Roberts  vs.  Anthony Russo  (2001; Roberts won 6,064 to 4,759)   David Roberts  vs. Carol Marsh (2005; Roberts won 5,761 to 4,239. See  The 2005 Hoboken election )       [ edit ]   Public safety   The city has a police department, a fire department, and a volunteer  Emergency medical services  (EMS) department.
