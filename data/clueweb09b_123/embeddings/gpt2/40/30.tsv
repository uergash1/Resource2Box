With spacious, modern, passenger-friendly twin terminals, ONT is less congested and thereby more efficient  on the runways, at the gates and at the centralized car rental center  and thereby, a smart move for arrival and departure in Southern California.                         www.lawa.org/ont/welcomeONT.cfm LA - Ontario International Airport 2900 E. Airport Drive Ontario, CA 91761 Telephone: (909) 937-2700 TDD: (909) 937-2163           Opened September 27, 1998, LA-Ontario International Airport's new, $270 million twin terminals offer great convenience and services for passengers, while making a powerful design statement that places it in the forefront of modern airport architecture. In each of the 265,000 square-foot terminals, a vaulted, glass-enclosed terminal lobby serves as the focal point. The space is completely sky-lit, creating an open, modern feel that is welcoming to busy travelers and affords views of the majestic San Gabriel Mountains just north of Ontario.        The twin terminal approach shortens walking distances between parking lots and the terminals, and between aircraft gates and the ticketing and baggage claim areas. Each terminal is built on two levels, with ticketing and baggage claim on the ground floor, and aircraft gates and passenger services on the second level.

If you want to travel in  southern Africa  then South Africa is a good place to start. While you can fly into any country in southern Africa, most flights will route through South Africa anyway. South Africa is also a good place to get used to traveling in the region (though some would argue that  Namibia  is better for that). Of course South Africa is not only a jumping off point, it is itself a superb destination rich in culture, fauna & flora and history.  Outsiders' views of South Africa are colored by the same stereotypes as the rest of Africa. Contrary to popular belief, South Africa is not devastatingly poor with an unstable government that is rapidly going to pot. Although the rural part of South Africa remains among the poorest and the least developed parts of the world and poverty in the townships can be appalling, progress is being made. The process of recovering from apartheid, which lasted almost 46 years, is quite slow. In fact, South Africa's United Nations Human Development Index  [6]  which was slowly improving in the final years of apartheid, has declined dramatically since 1996, largely due to the AIDS pandemic, and poverty levels appear to be on the increase  [7] .  South Africa boasts a well-developed infrastructure and has all the modern amenities and technologies, much of it developed during the years of white minority rule. The government is stable, although corruption is common. The government and the primary political parties generally have a high level of respect for democratic institutions and human rights, although the government's support of the misrule of neighboring Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe has raised questions about its commitment to human rights and even democracy itself  [8] .    [ edit ]   History   The tip of  Africa  has been home to the Khoisan ( collective name for Hottentot(Koi) and Bushmen(San) ) people for thousands of years. Their rock art can still be found in many places throughout  South Africa . Bantu tribes started expanding into  Southern Africa  around 2500 years ago and by around 500 AD the different cultural groups as we know them today had been established in the area.  The first permanent European settlement was built after the Dutch East India Company reached the Cape of Good Hope in April 1652. In the late 1700's the  Boers  ( the settling farmers ) slowly started expanding into the interior. In 1795  Britain  took control of the Cape and in 1820 a large group of British Settlers arrived in the region. In 1835 large numbers of  Boers  started out on the  Groot Trek  into the interior after becoming dissatisfied with the British rule. In the interior they established their own republics after a number of bloody conflicts with the local population.  Two wars for control over the region were fought between the  Boers  and the British in 1880 and 1899. This was when the British contained the Boer population in the first modern concentration camps.  The  Union of South Africa  was formed in 1910, consolidating the various  Boer  republics and British colonies. From this, the Republic of  South Africa  was formed in 1961. Non-Europeans were largely excluded in all these political changes and even with the creation of the Union were not given the right to vote. From 1948 additional  apartheid  laws were introduced to erode the right of the black population further. Since then, South Africa (at least the government itself), became almost synonymous with fascism, racism, and many other pejorative descriptions. In the years to follow, the country, despite having strong economic growth until the 1980s, experienced frequent uprisings and other social disturbances in response to the apartheid laws. Among them: weapons embargoes, being banned from the Olympic Games, and deliberate violations of the laws by black radicals.  In 1992, 68% of the voting white population voted in a referendum to have the  apartheid  system abolished. This was quickly followed by a new constitution in 1993 and the first fully democratic election in 1994.    [ edit ]   Place names   Many region, city, street and building names in  South Africa  have been changed after the end of apartheid and some of them are still being changed today. These changes can sometimes lead to confusion as many of the new names are not yet well known. This travel guide will use the official new names, but also mention the previous names where possible.

The rainy season for most of the country is in the summer, except in the  Western Cape  where the rains come in the winter. Rainfall in the  Eastern Cape  is distributed evenly throughout the year. Winter temperatures hover around zero, summers can be very hot, in excess of 35 Celsius in some places.

Check with the Home Affairs  [11]   and your travel agent whether you need to prearrange a visa. Do not show up without a visa if you are required to have one, as visas will not be issued at points of entry. If needed, you can extend your visa in South Africa. With an extension the total amount of time you are allowed to stay is 6 months. Additional information as well as Visa application forms can be found at the Department of Home Affairs  [12]  , ph:  +27  (0)12 810 8911  The Department of Home Affairs is notoriously inefficient, so make sure to apply for visas and visa extensions as early as possible.  Make sure you have  2 blank pages  back to back in your passport and that it is valid for at least 30 days after your intended date of departure, or you will be sent back! Make sure you have a return ticket available or they will send you back. If you need to pick up a ticket at the airport have the flight number and details handy and speak with the customs guy, they should check your story out and let you in (be firm). Be wary of arriving with a damaged passport as new security measures might trip up your entry.

This section contains important information regarding your forthcoming journey.              Travel Information    Please print this document as it contains general information regarding your travel and your arrival in Guernsey          Flight Information        Photo Identification    Due to increased security all airlines now require photographic ID. Acceptable forms of ID vary from one airline to another. Please check the attached document to see which forms of ID are acceptable for the airline on which you are travelling.      Photo ID Information  48.76 Kb     Electronic or Paper Tickets    There are two types of tickets that you'll encounter when using an airline, namely the conventional paper ticket and the electronic ticket (also known as ticket-less travel).    With an electronic ticket your booking information is held within the airline's reservation system, and is indicated as electronic tickets when you check in.    Please take a copy of your confirmation and/or reservation number to the appropriate flight check in desk on your date of travel at least 1 hour prior to your scheduled time of departure. On proof of identification (either your passport or other form of photographic ID) you will be issued with your boarding pass. The same procedure will apply for your return travel.    There is no question that electronic tickets are better. It is quite remarkable the number of people who leave their tickets at home, lose them or are unfortunately stolen resulting in costly fees to have the tickets replaced.

clueweb09-en0006-94-14594	        Safer air travel         Travelling with children   Travelling with children, especially young children, puts special demands on    the adults responsible for their well being. Here are some tips that can make    the trip pleasant for all concerned.   Planning   Planning ahead is essential for any air trip, and even more    so when children are involved. Make sure you keep handy any supplies you will    need to take care of any normal or special needs for the child.    Assume the worst: every seat will be allocated, the toilets will not have changing tables, the airline will not have any suitable food, you will be delayed for several hours, and any checked luggage will be lost. Carrying all the child's essentials is important, especially if your child is on a special diet or on medication.    Responsibilities    The flight attendant is not responsible for supervising    your child - YOU ARE. On a very long flight from Australia to the US a parent,    travelling alone with a toddler, fell asleep. A few minutes later a flight attendant    carrying the child woke the parent and informed her that the child had been    wandering around the one of the aircraft galleys - a place with all sorts of    dangerously hot or sharp objects that could have easily injured the child. Also    be aware that when walking about the aircraft with your child, hot drinks and    food, silverware, and other hazards are within their reach. No matter how tired    you may get, your child is still your responsibility.    Seating    It is strongly recommended that infants be put into a child restraint system appropriate for their weight. Most  Approved Australian Safety Standard   child restraint seats designed for use in motor vehicles are suitable for use in an aircraft, if used in accordance with the seat manufacturer's instructions. For travellers from overseas, Canadian, European and USA standard motor vehicle child seats are acceptable. Additionally, dedicated aviation restraint systems approved by those Airworthiness Authorities are also acceptable. This includes a device from the USA marketed as the Kidsflysafe CARES'.    Child booster seats are only allowed to be used in seats which incorporate a shoulder harness. For that reason, booster seats are not allowed to be used on standard airline seating. As a guide, once a child has outgrown their full harness child restraint, it is safe for them to use the aircraft seat & lap belt.    An airline may supply child restraint seats or may allow you to use your own. When making your booking, check to see what arrangements the airline you are travelling with has for the safe transport of your infant. Once you have confirmed the acceptable use of the child restraint, think about the following:        Find a way to conveniently carry the infant, bags and possibly a child restraint through airports and into and out of aircraft,      Check with the airline you are flying with and follow their recommendations for using child restraint systems,    Check whether it is a requirement of the airline you are travelling with, that child restraints are used.        Small children enjoy reaching out and exploring. If they are seated beside the aisle they could get hurt if their arms get bumped by a passing person or serving cart. Ideally, two responsible adults should sit one on either side of a small child.    Alternatively, the child can be seated on a row with a window on one side and a responsible adult on the other. If an infant is in a child restraint, that restraint should not impede another person making their way to the aisle so in that situation it is best that they be placed in the window seat.    Turbulence can happen at any time and without warning, so keep your child belted in as much as possible. If the child wants to get up and move around, let them do so only if the seat belt sign is off. See our sections on  turbulence   and  crash positions with infants.    CASA regulation  CAAP - 235-2(1)  covers the carriage and restraint of small children in aircraft.   Entertainment    Try to avoid bringing along toys that are sharp, heavy,    or that break easily. If the child has an electronic game, only allow them to    use it during the cruise portion of flight. Electronic games may interfere with    an aircraft's navigational system during other phases of the flight.   Emergencies    Make sure you are aware of emergency equipment or procedures    that would apply to your child:        Pay attention to the standard preflight emergency briefing,    Ask a flight attendant if that particular aircraft has emergency equipment like life preservers specifically designed for small children,    If your child has a medical condition that may become an issue during the flight, make a flight attendant, counter agent, or gate agent aware of that possibility before the flight.     If the emergency oxygen masks drop down, put your mask on first. If the brain    is starved of oxygen, you can get confused or pass out. Then you would be unable    to help yourself or your child. For more information, see our section on what    to do  in an emergency.   Travelling alone   Take extra precautions for children travelling alone. The    older child travelling alone needs extra protection as well:        Escort the child onto the aircraft. Ensure the seat they are in does not have hazards like heavy carry on items in the overhead storage bin.     Tell the chief flight attendant that the child is travelling unaccompanied.   Make sure the child understands that they should report any problems to a flight attendant, ranging from feeling sick to being seated next to a suspicious character.      If the child has to change planes, make arrangements for the child to be      escorted between gates. This might cost extra but is required for small children      and is recommended for older children.    Arrange with the airline that the person meeting your child at the destination is properly identified.                CASA home   Passenger safety      How to pack    Is your luggage safe?

clueweb09-enwp00-00-12341	"                     Air Travel Organisers' Licensing          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL)  is a United Kingdom  Civil Aviation Authority  (CAA) scheme to protect people who have purchased  package holidays  and flights from a member  tour operator .   The majority of UK tour operators are required to hold an ATOL licence, without which they may not legally sell air travel. ATOL licenced firms will have had their business practices inspected by the CAA. An ATOL licensed tour operator must also obtain insurance  bonds  from the CAA. The aim of this is to provide refunds to travellers affected by any event which causes the airline to be unable to provide travel for its customers, and to arrange for flights (in addition to accommodation and other items which may be included in a package holiday) to return home those who are still abroad at this time.           Contents       1   History     1.1   Legal requirement   1.2   Early practice       2   References   3   External links               [ edit ]   History   In the 1960s, voluntary organisations such as the  Association of British Travel Agents  (ABTA) provided a degree of financial protection for air travellers. In 1970, the Federation of Tour Operators (FTO) (then the  Tour Operators Study Group ) introduced a bonding scheme whereby their members had to obtain  bonds  to the value of 5% of their annual  turnover . In 1972, the ABTA followed suit.     [ edit ]   Legal requirement   The  Civil Aviation Act 1971  established the  CAA . Covered under this act was the creation of the original ATOL Regulations. These mandated that all travel organisers, those tour operators whose primary mode of transport was air (but not airlines themselves), must hold a licence. These regulations came into effect in 1973.     [ edit ]   Early practice   In August 1974, the  Court Line Group  collapsed. It was the second largest tour operator at the time and its subsidiaries included  Clarksons Holidays . Clarksons Holidays held an ATOL licence and were therefore theoretically covered by their insurance bond. Unfortunately, although the 35,000 passengers stranded abroad were repatriated, there was insufficient funds for the 100,000 whose holidays had been paid in advance. This led to considerable media attention. [ 1 ]  A government fund called the  Air Travel Trust  has since been introduced to pay for any excess which is not covered by ATOL.

This section contains important information regarding your forthcoming journey.              Travel Information    Please print this document as it contains general information regarding your travel and your arrival in Jersey       Air Travel Information Photo Identification    Due to increased security all airlines now require photographic ID. Acceptable forms of ID vary from one airline to another. Please check the attached document to see which forms of ID are acceptable for the airline on which you are travelling.      Photo ID Information  48.76 Kb     Electronic or Paper Tickets    There are two types of tickets that you'll encounter when using an airline, namely the conventional paper ticket and the electronic ticket (also known as ticket-less travel).    With an electronic ticket your booking information is held within the airline's reservation system, and is indicated as electronic tickets when you check in.    Please take a copy of your confirmation and/or reservation number to the appropriate flight check in desk on your date of travel at least 1 hour prior to your scheduled time of departure. On proof of identification (either your passport or other form of photographic ID) you will be issued with your boarding pass. The same procedure will apply for your return travel.    There is no question that electronic tickets are better. It is quite remarkable the number of people who leave their tickets at home, lose them or are unfortunately stolen resulting in costly fees to have the tickets replaced.    Important Airline Information    Please print the document for the Airline with whom you are travelling. This will contain all the necessary information regarding check-in, baggage etc.      Aurigny  16.68 Kb      Blue Islands  24.36 Kb      Flybe  18.81 Kb                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ©2008 C.I.

Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (January 2008)       Air travel  is a form of  travel  using an  airplane .   The comfort experienced when traveling by air depends on several factors starting with the airport, the choice of the  airline  and the  travel class .   Travel class on an airplane is usually split into a two or four class model. Domestic flights usually have two classes:  Economy Class  and  Business Class  partitioned into  cabins . International flights may have up to four classes: Economy Class,  Premium Economy , Business Class or  Club Class  and  First Class .   The differences between premium economy and economy are quite significant, but the  cost  is not greatly altered by purchasing a Premium Economy ticket. The price difference between an economy class ticket and a first class ticket, however, are often extreme.   Most air travel starts and ends at a commercial  airport . The typical procedure is  check-in ,  border control ,  airport security  baggage and passenger check before entering the gate,  boarding ,  flying  and pick-up of luggage and - limited to international flights - another border control at the host country's  border .

So by the time you read this a few         procedures we explain may be different.            INTRODUCTION           The elimination of government economic         regulation of the airlines has resulted in lower fares         and a wide variety of price/service options. In this new         commercial environment, consumers have had to take a more         active role in choosing their air service by learning to         ask a number of questions.           -Am I more concerned with price or         scheduling? Am I willing to fly at an odd hour if it         means saving $25?           -Will the airline penalize me for         changing my reservation?           -What will the airline do for me if it         cancels my flight?           This booklet is designed to explain your         rights and responsibilities as an air traveler. We hope         it helps you become a resourceful consumer.           1. AIR FARES           Because of the emphasis on price         competition, consumers may choose from a wide variety of         air fares. Some airlines are trying a ""back to         basics"" approach-offering flights at bargain         basement prices with few extras. For fare information,         you can contact a travel agent, another ticket outlet or         an airline serving the places you want to visit. Ask them         to tell you the names of all airlines flying there. A         travel agent can find virtually all airlines' fares in         his or her computer. Or, if you prefer you can call each         airline to ask about the fares they charge, particularly         any special promotional fares they may be offering at the         time. You can also pay attention to newspaper and radio         ads, where airlines advertise many of the discount plans         that apply to your city. Finally, be alert to new         companies serving the market. They may offer lower fares         or different services than older established airlines.         Here are some tips to help you decide among air fares:           Be flexible in your travel plans in order         to get the lowest fare. The best deals may be limited to         travel on certain days of the week or particular hours of         the day. After you get a fare quote, ask the reservations         agent if you could save even more by leaving a day         earlier or later, or by taking a different flight on the         same day.            * Plan as far ahead as you can. Some         airlines set aside only a few seats on each flight at the         lower rates. The real bargains often sell out very         quickly. On the other hand, air carriers sometimes make         more discount seats available later. If you had decided         against a trip because the discount fare you wanted was         not available on the desired date, try again, especially         just before the advance-purchase deadline.            * Some airlines may have discounts that         others don't offer. In a large metropolitan area, the         fare could depend on which airport you use. Also, a         connection (change of planes) or a one-stop flight is         sometimes cheaper than a nonstop.            * Does the air fare include types of         service that airlines have traditionally provided, such         as meals or free baggage handling? If you have a         connection involving two airlines, will your bags be         transferred? Can you get advance seat assignments? If you         are stranded, will the ticket be good on another carrier         at no extra charge? Will the first airline pay for meals         or hotel rooms during the wait?            * Many discount fares are non-refundable;         if you buy one of these fares and later cancel your trip,         you will not get your money back. Some fares also have a         penalty for changing flights or dates even if you don't         want a refund. You may also have to pay any difference in         air fares if your fare is not available on the new         flight.            * Some airlines will not increase the         fare after the ticket is issued and paid for. (Simply         holding a reservation without a ticket does not guarantee         the fare.) Other airlines may reserve the right to         collect more money from you if the fare that you had         purchased goes up before departure time. Find out from         the airline before you buy your ticket what its policy is         on assessing fare increases after the ticket is         purchased.            * After you buy your ticket, call the         airline or travel agent once or twice before departure to         check the fare. Fares change all the time, and if that         same fare goes down before you fly, some airlines will         refund the difference. But you have to ask.            Differences in air fares can be         substantial. Careful comparison shopping among airlines         does take time, but it can lead to real savings.           2. RESERVATIONS AND TICKETS           Once you decide when and where you want         to go, and which airline you want to use, getting         reservations and tickets is a fairly simple process. You         can make all of your arrangements by telephone, at the         airline's ticket office, or through a travel agent or         other ticket outlet. There are a few potential pitfalls,         however, and these pointers should help you avoid them.           * If your travel plans fall into a busy         period, call for reservations early. Flights for holidays         may sell out weeks-sometimes months-ahead of time. Don't         buy a standby fare or an 'open return' ticket if you need         to fly during a high-demand period, especially the end of         August. You could be stranded for a week or more before a         seat becomes available.            * Ask the reservations agent to give you         the on-time performance code for any flights that you are         considering. This is a one-digit code in the reservations         computer that shows how often that flight arrived on time         (within 15 minutes) during the most recent reported         month. For example, an ""8"" means that flight         arrived within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival time         between 80% and 89.9% of the time. If you are deciding         between two flights with similar schedules and fares, you         may want to choose the one with the better on-time         record. (Only the largest U.S. airlines are required to         maintain these codes.)            * When you make a reservation, be sure         the agent records the information accurately. Before you         hang up or leave the ticket office, review all of the         essential information with the agent-the spelling of your         name, the flight numbers and travel dates, and the cities         you are traveling between. If there is more than one         airport at either city, be sure you check which one         you'll be using. It's also important to give the airline         your home and work telephone numbers so they can let you         know if there is any change in their schedule.            * Your ticket will show the flight         number, departure time, date, and status of your         reservation for each flight of your itinerary. The         ""status"" box is important. ""OK"" means         you're confirmed. Anything else means that the         reservation is not yet certain (e.g., waitlisted).            * A ""direct"" (or         ""through"") flight can have one or more stops.         Sometimes flights with only one flight number can even         involve a change of planes. Ask about your exact routing.                    * If you are flying to a small city and         your flight number has four digits, you may be booked on         a commuter airline that has an agreement with the major         carrier in whose name the flight is held out. If you are         unsure, ask the reservations agent about the airline and         the aircraft type; these flights are identified in the         computer.            * When a reservations agent asks you to         buy your tickets by a specific time or date, this is a         deadline. And if you don't make the deadline, the airline         may cancel your reservations without telling you.           * Try to have your tickets in hand before         you go to the airport. This speeds your check-in and         helps you avoid some of the tension you might otherwise         feel if you had to wait in a slow-moving ticketing line         and worry about missing your flight.            * If your reservations are booked far         enough ahead of time, the airline may offer to mail your         tickets to you. However, if you don't receive the tickets         and the airline's records show that they mailed them, you         may have to go through cumbersome lost-ticket procedures         (see the end of this chapter). It is safer to check the         telephone directory for a conveniently located travel         agency or airline ticket office and buy your tickets         there.            * As soon as you receive your ticket         check to make sure all the information on it is correct,         especially the airports (if any of the cities have more         than one) and the flight dates. Have any necessary         corrections made immediately.            * Bring a photo I.D. when you fly, and         have your airline ticket issued using your name as it         appears on that I.D. Many airlines are requesting such         identification at check-in in order to reduce the re-         selling of discount tickets. (Airlines don't permit         tickets to be sold or given to other persons.) On         international flights, make sure your name is the same on         your ticket and your passport. If your name has recently         changed and the name on your ticket and your I.D. are         different, bring docu- mentation of the change (e.g., a         marriage certificate or court order).            * It's a good idea to reconfirm your         reservations before you start your trip; flight schedules         sometimes change. On international trips, most airlines         require that you reconfirm your onward or return         reservations at least 72 hours before each flight. If you         don't, your reservations may be canceled.            * Check your ticket as you board each         flight to ensure that only the correct coupon has been         removed by the airline agent.            Paying for and refunding airline         tickets           * If you plan to pay in person and with         your own bank check, take at least two forms of         identification with you like a driver's license, major         credit card, or employee I.D. card. Particularly when you         purchase tickets far from your home town, airlines,         travel agencies and other ticket outlets will want to         confirm your identity.            If you paid for your ticket with cash and         you have a refundable fare, you can often get an         immediate refund from the issuing airline or travel         agency. If you paid by personal check, the refund will         gen- erally have to be mailed to you. NOTE: In some cases         tickets purchased overseas in foreign currency can only         be refunded in that same currency and country, due to         foreign government monetary restrictions. Keep this in         mind if you are considering buying a ticket in a foreign         country.            * When you pay by credit card, your         charge account is billed-whether you use your tickets or         not. You won't receive credit unless the original unused         tickets are returned to the airline. You usually can't         get a cash refund for a credit card purchase.            * If you buy your tickets with a credit         card and then change your flights, the ticket agent may         want to credit the amount of the old tickets and issue         another set with a second charge to your account. You may         want to insist that the value of your old tickets be         applied to the new ones, with the difference in price         charged or credited to your account. While this creates a         little extra work for the airlines, it prevents         double-billing to your charge account.           Payment by credit card provides certain         protections under federal credit laws. When a refund is         due, the airline must forward a credit to your card         company within seven business days after receiving a         complete refund application. If you paid by credit card         for a refundable fare and you have trouble getting a         refund that you are due, report this in writing to your         credit card company. If you write to them within 60 days         from the time that they mailed your first monthly         statement showing the charge for the airline ticket, the         card company should credit your account even if the         airline doesn't. This procedure is particularly useful if         your airline ceases operations before your flight.            Lost tickets           Airline tickets are similar to negotiable         documents. Because of this, refunds can be difficult to         obtain if tickets are lost or stolen. Many passengers         believe that air tickets can be replaced as easily as         travelers checks just because the reservation is in the         computer, but that is not the case. Your ticket number         may be shown on your credit card receipt or travel agency         itinerary. If it is not, jot down the number on a sheet         of paper and carry it separately from your ticket. Bring         it with you on your trip. If the ticket does go astray,         the airline can process your refund application more         quickly, and perhaps issue an on-the-spot replacement         ticket, if you can give them this number. You should         report a lost ticket immediately to the airline that is         shown as the issuing carrier at the top of the ticket.         You may be required to repurchase a ticket in order to         continue your trip. If you no longer meet all of the         restrictions on your discount fare (e.g., seven-day         advance purchase) the new ticket may cost more than the         old one did. In that event, however, it is generally the         higher fare that is eventually refunded, as long as you         don't change any of the cities, flights or dates on your         trip. Once the airline establishes that you actually         bought the ticket, they will begin processing your refund         application. There is often a waiting period of two to         six months. If anyone uses or cashes in your ticket while         the refund is pending, the airline may refuse to give you         your money back. Finally, there is a handling charge that         the airline may deduct from the refund. All in all,         getting a refund or replacement for a lost ticket is a         lot of trouble, and there's no guarantee you'll receive         either one. So the best advice is-don't lose the ticket         in the first place.           3. DELAYED AND CANCELED FLIGHTS           Airlines don't guarantee their schedules,         and you should realize this when planning your trip.         There are many things that can-and often do-make it         impossible for flights to arrive on time. Some of these         problems, like bad weather, air traffic delays, and         mechanical repairs, are hard to predict and beyond the         airlines' control. If your flight is delayed, try to find         out how late it will be. But keep in mind that it is         sometimes difficult for airlines to estimate the total         duration of a delay during its early stages. In so-         called ""creeping delays,"" developments occur         which were not anticipated when the carrier made its         initial estimate of the length of the delay. Weather that         had been forecast to improve can instead deteriorate, or         a mechanical problem can turn out to be more complex than         initially determined. If the problem is with local         weather or air traffic control, all flights will probably         be late and there's not much you or the airline can do to         speed up your departure. If there's a mechanical problem         with the plane for your particular flight or if the crew         is delayed on an incoming flight, you might be better off         trying to arrange another flight, as long as you don't         have to pay a cancellation penalty or higher fare for         changing your reservations. (It is sometimes easier to         make such arrangements from a pay phone than at a ticket         counter.) If you find a flight on another airline, ask         the first airline to endorse your ticket to the new         carrier; this could save you a fare increase. Remember,         however, that there is no rule requiring them to do this.         If your flight is canceled, most airlines will rebook you         on the first flight of theirs to your destination on         which space is available, at no additional charge. If         this involves a significant delay find out if another         carrier has space, and ask the first airline to endorse         your ticket. Finding extra seats may be difficult,         however, especially over holidays and other peak travel         times.            Each airline has its own policies about         what it will do for delayed passengers waiting at the         airport; there are no federal requirements. If you are         delayed, ask the airline staff if they will pay for meals         or a phone call. Some airlines, often those charging very         low fares, do not provide any amenities to stranded         passengers. Others may not offer amenities if the delay         is caused by bad weather or something else beyond the         airline's control. Contrary to popular belief, airlines         are not required to compensate passengers whose flights         are delayed or canceled. As discussed in the chapter on         overbooking, compensation is required by law only when         you are ""bumped"" from a flight that is         oversold. Airlines almost always refuse to pay passengers         for financial losses resulting from a delayed flight. If         the purpose of your trip is to close a potentially         lucrative business deal, to give a speech or lecture, to         attend a family function, or to be present at any         time-sensitive event, you might want to allow a little         extra leeway and take an earlier flight. In other words,         airline delays and cancellations aren't unusual, and         defensive counter- planning is a good idea when time is         your most important consideration. When booking your         flight remember that a departure early in the day is less         likely to be delayed than a later flight, due to         ""ripple"" effects throughout the day. Also, if         an early flight does get delayed or canceled, you have         more rerouting options. If you book the last flight of         the day and it is canceled, you could get stuck         overnight. You may select a connection (change of planes)         over a nonstop or direct flight because of the convenient         departure time or lower fare. However, a change of planes         always involves the possibility of a misconnection. If         you have a choice of connections and the fares and         service are equivalent, choose the one with the         least-congested connecting airport, so it will be easier         to get to your second flight. You may wish to take into         consideration the potential for adverse weather if you         have a choice of connecting cities. When making your         reservation for a connection, always check the amount of         time between flights. Ask yourself what will happen if         the first flight is delayed; if you don't like the         answer, pick another flight or ask the agent to         ""construct"" a connection that allows more time.                    4. OVERBOOKING           Overbooking is not illegal, and most         airlines overbook their scheduled flights to a certain         extent in order to compensate for ""no-shows.""         Passengers are sometimes left behind or         ""bumped"" as a result. When an oversale occurs,         the Department of Transportation (DOT) requires airlines         to ask people who aren't in a hurry to give up their         seats voluntarily, in exchange for compensation. Those         passengers bumped against their will are, with a few         exceptions, entitled to compensation.            Voluntary bumping           Almost any group of airline passengers         includes some people with urgent travel needs and others         who may be more concerned about the cost of their tickets         than about getting to their destination on time. Our         rules require airlines to seek out people who are willing         to give up their seats for some compensation before         bumping anyone in- voluntarily. Here's how this works. At         the check-in or boarding area, airline employees will         look for volunteers when it appears that the flight has         been oversold. If you're not in a rush to arrive at your         next destination, you can give your reservation back to         the airline in exchange for compensation and a later         flight. But before you do this, you may want to get         answers to these important questions:           * When is the next flight on which the         airline can confirm your seat? The alternate flight may         be just as acceptable to you. On the other hand, if they         offer to put you on standby on another flight that's         full, you could be stranded.            * Will the airline provide other         amenities such as free meals, a hotel room, phone calls,         or ground transportation? If not, you might have to spend         the money they offer you on food or lodging while you         wait for the next flight.           DOT has not said how much the airline has         to give volunteers. This means carriers may negotiate         with their passengers for a mutually acceptable amount of         money-or maybe a free trip or other benefits. Airlines         give employees guidelines for bargaining with passengers,         and they may select those volunteers willing to sell back         their reservations for the lowest price. If the airline         offers you a free ticket, ask about restrictions. How         long is the ticket good for? Is it ""blacked         out"" during holiday periods when you might want to         use it? Can it be used for international flights? Most         importantly, can you make a reservation, and if so, how         far before departure are you permitted to make it?            Involuntary bumping           DOT requires each airline to give all         passengers who are bumped involuntarily a written         statement describing their rights and explaining how the         carrier decides who gets on an oversold flight and who         doesn't. Those travelers who don't get to fly are         frequently entitled to an on-the-spot payment of denied         boarding compensation. The amount depends on the price of         their ticket and the length of the delay:           * If you are bumped involuntarily and the         airline arranges substitute transportation that is         scheduled to get you to your final destination (including         later connections) within one hour of your original         scheduled arrival time, there is no compensation.            * If the airline arranges substitute         transportation that is scheduled to arrive at your         destination between one and two hours after your original         arrival time (between one and four hours on international         flights), the airline must pay you an amount equal to         your one-way fare to your final destination, with a $400         maximum.            * If the substitute transportation is         scheduled to get you to your destination more than two         hours later (four hours internationally), or if the         airline does not make any substitute travel arrangements         for you, the compensation doubles (200% of your fare,         $800 maximum).            * You always get to keep your original         ticket and use it on another flight. If you choose to         make your own arrangements, you can request an         ""involuntary refund"" for the ticket for the         flight you were bumped from. The denied boarding         compensation is essentially a payment for your         inconvenience.            Like all rules, however, there are a few         conditions and exceptions:           * To be eligible for compensation, you         must have a confirmed reservation. A written confirmation          issued by the airline or an authorized agent or reservation          service qualifies you in this         regard even if the airline can't find your reservation in         the computer, as long as you didn't cancel your         reservation or miss a reconfirmation deadline.           * You must meet the airline's deadline         for buying your ticket. Discount tickets must usually be         purchased within a certain number of days after the         reservation was made. Other tickets normally have to be         picked up no later than 30 minutes before the flight.            In addition to the ticketing deadline,         each airline has a check-in deadline, which is the amount         of time before scheduled departure that you must present         yourself to the airline at the airport. For domestic         flights most carriers require you to be at the departure          gate between 10 minutes and 30 minutes         before scheduled departure, but some deadlines can be an hour or         longer. Check-in deadlines on international         flights can be as much as three hours before scheduled         departure time.         Some airlines may simply require you to be at the         ticket/baggage counter by this time; most, however,         require that you get all the way to the boarding area. If         you miss the ticketing or check-in deadline, you may have         lost your reservation and your right to compensation if         the flight is oversold.           * As noted above, no compensation is due         if the airline arranges substitute transportation which         is scheduled to arrive at your destination within one         hour of your originally scheduled arrival time.           * If the airline must substitute a         smaller plane for the one it originally planned to use,         the carrier isn't required to pay people who are bumped         as a result.In addition, on flights using aircraft with          30 through 60 passenger seats, compensation is not required          if you were bumped due to safety-related aircraft weight          or balance constraints.           * The rules do not apply to charter         flights, or to scheduled flights operated with planes         that hold fewer than 30 passengers. They don't apply to         international flights inbound to the United States,         although some airlines on these routes may follow them         voluntarily. Also, if you are flying between two foreign         cities-from Paris to Rome, for example-these rules will         not apply. The European Community has a rule on bumpings         that occur in an EC country; ask the airline for details,         or contact DOT.            When a flight is oversold and there are not          enough volunteers, some airlines bump passengers with the          lowest fares first.  Once you have purchased your ticket,          the most effective way to reduce the risk         of being bumped is to get to the airport early. For passengers          in the same fare class the last passengers to check in are         usually the first to be bumped, even if they have met the         check-in deadline. Allow extra time; assume that the         airport access road is backed up, the parking lot is         full, and there is a long line at the check-in counter.         However, if you arrive so early that your airline has         another flight to your destination leaving before the one         that you are booked on, either switch to the earlier         flight or don't check your bag until after the first         flight leaves. If you check your bag right away, it might         get put on the earlier flight and remain unattended at         your destination airport for hours. Airlines may offer         free transportation on future flights in place of a check         for denied boarding compensation. However, if you are         bumped involuntarily you have the right to insist on a         check if that is your preference. Once you cash the check         (or accept the free flight), you will probably lose the         right to demand more money from the airline later on.         However, if being bumped costs you more money than the         airline will pay you at the airport, you can try to         negotiate a higher settlement with their complaint         department. If this doesn't work, you usually have 30         days from the date on the check to decide if you want to         accept the amount of the check. You are always free to         decline the check(e.g., not cash it) and take the airline to court to try to         obtain more compensation. The government's denied         boarding regulation spells out the airlines' minimum         obligation to people they bump involuntarily. Finally,         don't be a ""no-show."" If you are holding         confirmed reservations you don't plan to use, notify the         airline. If you don't, they will cancel all onward or         return reservations on your trip.            5. BAGGAGE           Between the time you check your luggage         in and the time you claim it at your destination, it may         have passed through a maze of conveyor belts and baggage         carts; once airborne, baggage may tumble around the cargo         compartment if the plane hits rough air. In all fairness         to the airlines, however, relatively few bags are damaged         or lost. With some common-sense packing and other         precautions, your bags will probably be among the ones         that arrive safely.            Packing           You can pack to avoid problems. Some         items should never be put into a bag you plan to check         into the cargo compartment:           * Small valuables: cash, credit cards,         jewelry, cameras.            * Critical items: medicine, keys,         passport, tour vouchers, business papers.           * Irreplaceable items: manuscript,         heirlooms.           * Fragile items: eyeglasses, glass         containers, liquids.            Things like this should be carried on         your person or packed in a carry-on bag that will fit         under the seat. Remember, the only way to be sure your         valuables are not damaged or lost is to keep them with         you. Even if your bag is not lost, it could be delayed         for a day or two. Don't put perishables in a checked bag;         they may spoil if it is delayed. It is wise to put items         that you will need during the first 24 hours in a         carry-on bag (e.g. toiletries, a change of underwear).         Check with the airline for its limits on the size,         weight, or number of carry-on pieces. (There is no single         federal standard.) If you are using more than one         airline, check on all of them. Inquire about your flight;         different airplanes can have different limits. Don't         assume that the flight will have unlimited closet space         for carry-on garment bags; some may have to be checked.         If you plan to go shopping at your destination and bring         your purchases aboard as carry-on, keep the limits in         mind. If you check these purchases, however, carry the         receipts separately; they may be necessary for a claim if         the merchandise is lost or damaged. Don't put anything         into a carry-on bag that could be considered a weapon         (e.g. scissors, pen knife).            Checked baggage is also subject to         limits. On most domestic and international flights, it's         two checked bags (three if you don't have any carry-on         luggage). There can be an extra charge if you bring more,         or if you exceed the airline's limits on the size of the         bags. On some flights between two foreign cities, your         allowance may be based on the weight of the bags rather         than the number of pieces. The same two bags that cost         you nothing to check when you started your trip could         result in expensive excess-baggage charges under a weight         system. Ask the airlines about the limit for every         segment of your international trip before you leave home,         especially if you have a stopover of a day or two or if         you are changing carriers. The bags you check should be         labeled- inside and out-with your name, address and phone         number. Add the name and address of a person to contact         at your destination if it's practical to do so. Almost         all of the bags that are misplaced by airlines do turn up         sooner or later. With proper labeling, the bag and its         owner can usually be reunited within a few hours. Don't         overpack a bag. This puts pressure on the latches, making         it easier for them to pop open. If you plan to         check any electrical equipment, glassware, small         appliances, pottery, typewriters, musical instruments or         other fragile items, they should be packed in a container         specifically designed to survive rough handling*         preferably a factory-sealed carton or a padded hard-         shell carrying case.            Check-in           Don't check in at the last minute. Even         if you make the flight, your bag may not. If you miss the         airline's check-in deadline, the carrier might not assume         liability for your bag if it is delayed or lost. If you         have a choice, select flights that minimize the potential         for baggage disruption. The likelihood of a bag going         astray increases from #1 to #4 below (i.e., #1 is         safest): 1) nonstop flight 2) direct or 'through' flight         (one or more stops, but no change of aircraft) 3) online         connection (change of aircraft but not airlines) 4)         interline connection (change of aircraft and airlines)         When you check in, remove straps and hooks from garment         bags that you are sending as checked baggage. These can         get caught in baggage processing machinery, causing         damage to the bag. The airline will put baggage         destination tags on your luggage and give you the stubs         to use as claim checks. Make sure you get a stub for         every bag. Don't throw them away until after you get your         bags back and you check the contents. Not only will you         need them if a claim is necessary, but you may need to         show them to security upon leaving the baggage-claim         area. Each tag has a three-letter code and flight number         that show the baggage sorters on which plane and to which         airport your luggage is supposed to go. Double-check the         tag before your bags go down the conveyor belt. (The         airline will be glad to tell you the code for your         destination when you make reservations or buy your         tickets.) Your bags may only be checked to one of your         intermediate stops rather than your destination city if         you must clear Customs short of your final destination,         or if you are taking a connection involving two airlines         that don't have an interline agreement. Be sure all of         the tags from previous trips are removed from your bag,         since they may confuse busy baggage handlers.            Claiming your bags           Many bags look alike. After you pull what         you think is your bag off the carousel, check the name         tag or the bag tag number. If your bag arrives open,         unlocked or visibly damaged, check right away to see if         any of the contents are missing or damaged. Report any         problems to the airline before leaving the airport;         insist on filling out a form. Open your suitcase         immediately when you get to where you are staying. Any         damage to the contents or any pilferage should be         immediately reported to the airline by telephone. Make a         note of the date and time of the call, and the name and         telephone number of the person you spoke with. Follow up         immediately with a certified letter to the airline.            Damage           If your suitcase arrives smashed or torn,         the airline will usually pay for repairs. If it can't be         fixed, they will negotiate a settlement to pay you its         depreciated value. The same holds true for belongings         packed inside. Airlines may decline to pay for damage         caused by the fragile nature of the broken item or         inadequate packing, rather than the airline's rough         handling. Carriers may also refuse to give you money for         your damaged items inside the bag when there's no         evidence of external damage to the suitcase. But airlines         generally don't disclaim liability for fragile         merchandise packed in its original factory sealed carton,         a cardboard mailing tube, or other container designed for         shipping and packed with protective padding material.         When you check in, airline personnel should let you know         if they think your suitcase or package may not survive         the trip intact. Before accepting a questionable item,         they will ask you to sign a statement in which you agree         to check it at your own risk. But even if you do sign         this form, the airline might be liable for damage if it         is caused by its own negligence shown by external injury         to the suitcase or package.            Delayed bags           If you and your suitcase don't connect at         your destination, don't panic. The airlines have very         sophisticated systems that track down about 98% of the         bags they misplace and return them to their owners within         hours. In many cases they will absorb reasonable expenses         you incur while they look for your missing belongings.         You and the airline may have different ideas of what's         reasonable, however, and the amount they will pay is         subject to negotiation.            If your bags don't come off the conveyor         belt, report this to the airline before you leave the         airport. Insist that they fill out a form and give you a         copy, even if they say the bag will be in on the next         flight. If the form doesn't contain the name of the         person who filled it out, ask for it. Get an appropriate         phone number for following up (not the Reservations         number). Don't assume that the airline will deliver the         bag without charge when it is found; ask them about this.         Most carriers set guidelines for their airport employees         that allow them to disburse some money at the airport for         emergency purchases. The amount depends on whether or not         you're away from home and how long it takes to track down         your bags and return them to you. If the airline does not         provide you a cash advance, it may still reimburse you         later for the purchase of necessities. Discuss with the         carrier the types of articles that would be reimbursable,         and keep all receipts. If the airline misplaces sporting         equip- ment, it will sometimes pay for the rental of         replacements. For replacement clothing or other articles,         the carrier might offer to absorb only a portion of the         purchase cost, on the basis that you will be able to use         the new items in the future. (The airline may agree to a         higher reimbursement if you turn the articles over to         them.) When you've checked in fresh foods or any other         perishable goods and they are ruined because their         delivery is delayed, the airline won't reimburse you.         Carriers may be liable if they lose or damage perishable         items, but they won't accept responsibility for spoilage         caused by a delay in delivery. Airlines are liable for         provable consequential damages up to the amount of their         liability limit (see below) in connection with the delay.         If you can't resolve the claim with the airline's airport         staff, keep a record of the names of the employees with         whom you dealt, and hold on to all travel documents and         receipts for any money you spent in connection with the         mishandling. (It's okay to surrender your baggage claim         tags to the airline when you fill out a form at the         airport, as long as you get a copy of the form and it         notes that you gave up the tags.) Call or write the         airline's consumer office when you get home.            Lost luggage           Once your bag is declared officially         lost, you will have to submit a claim. This usually means         you have to fill out a second, more detailed form. Check         on this; failure to complete the second form when         required could delay your claim. Missing the deadline for         filing it could invalidate your claim altogether. The         airline will usually refer your claim form to a central         office, and the negotiations between you and the airline         will begin. If your flight was a connection involving two         carriers, the final carrier is normally the one         responsible for processing your claim even if it appears         that the first airline lost the bag. Airlines don't         automatically pay the full amount of every claim they         receive. First, they will use the information on your         form to estimate the value of your lost belongings. Like         insurance companies, airlines consider the depreciated         value of your possessions, not their original price or         the replacement costs. If you're tempted to exaggerate         your claim, don't. Airlines may completely deny claims         they feel are inflated or fraudulent. They often ask for         sales receipts and other documentation to back up claims,         especially if a large amount of money is involved. If you         don't keep extensive records, you can expect to dicker         with the airline over the value of your goods. Generally,         it takes an airline anywhere from six weeks to three         months to pay you for your lost luggage. When they tender         a settlement, they may offer you the option of free         tickets on future flights in a higher amount than the         cash payment. Ask about all restrictions on these         tickets, such as ""blackout"" periods and how far         before departure you are permitted to make a reservation.                    Limits on liability           If your bags are delayed, lost or damaged on a domestic trip, the airline can invoke a ceiling of $3,300 per passenger on the amount of money they'll pay you. (This limit is $3,000 for flights before December 22, 2008.) When your luggage and its contents are worth more         than the liability limit, you may want to purchase         ""excess valuation,"" if available, from the         airline as you check in. This is not insurance, but it         will increase the carrier's potential liability. The         airline may refuse to sell excess valuation on some items         that are especially valuable or breakable, such as         antiques, musical instruments, jewelry, manuscripts,         negotiable securities and cash.      On international round trips that originate in the United States, the liability  limit is set by a treaty called the Montreal Convention.  This treaty also governs  liability on international round trips that originate in another country that has  ratified this Convention, and one-way trips between the U.S. and such a country.   Unless you buy excess valuation, the airline's baggage liability on a trip covered  by the Montreal Convention is limited to 1,000 ""Special Drawing Rights"" per  passenger.  The value of the SDR changes daily; see   www.imf.org .             This international limit also applies to         domestic segments of an international journey. This is         the case even if the domestic and international flights         are on separate tickets and you claim and re-check your         bag between the two flights. Keep in mind that the         liability limits are maximums. If the depreciated value         of your property is worth less than the liability limit,         this lower amount is what you will be offered. If the         airline's settlement doesn't fully reimburse your loss,         check your homeowner's or renter's insurance; it         sometimes covers losses away from the residence. Some         credit card companies and travel agencies offer optional         or even automatic supplemental baggage coverage.            Hazardous Items           Except for toiletries and medicines         totaling no more than 75 ounces, it is illegal and         extremely dangerous to carry on board or check in your         luggage any of the following hazardous materials:           * Aerosols: Polishes, waxes, degreasers,         cleaners, etc. * Corrosives: Acids, cleaners, wet cell         batteries, etc. * Flammables: Paints, thinners, lighter         fluid, liquid reservoir lighters, cleaners, adhesives,         camp stoves or portable gas equipment with fuel, etc. *         Explosives: Fireworks, flares, signal devices, loaded         firearms, gunpowder, etc. (Small arms ammunition for         personal use may be transported in checked luggage if it         is securely packed in material designed for that purpose.         These may not be placed in carry-on baggage.) *         Radioactives: Betascopes, radiopharmaceuticals,         uninstalled pacemakers, etc. * Compressed gases: Tear gas         or protective- type sprays, oxygen cylinders, divers'         tanks (unless they're empty), etc. * Infectious         substances * Poisonous materials: Rat poison, etc.           Matches (both 'strike anywhere' matches         and safety or 'book' matches) may only be carried on your         person. If you must travel with any of these materials,         check with the airline's air freight department to see if         special arrangements can be made. A violation of the         hazardous materials restrictions can result in a civil         penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation or a criminal         penalty of up to $500,000 and/or up to 5 years in jail.           6. SMOKING           Under U.S. government rules, smoking is         prohibited on all domestic scheduled-service flights         except for flights over six hours to or from Alaska or         Hawaii. This ban applies to domestic segments of         international flights, on both U.S. and foreign airlines         (e.g., the Chicago / New York leg of a flight that         operates Chicago/ New York / London). The ban does not         apply to nonstop international flights, even during the         time that they are in U.S. airspace (e.g., a Chicago /         London flight). The prohibition applies in the passenger         cabin and lavatories, but not in the cockpit. Smoking is         also banned on other scheduled-service flights by U.S.         airlines that are operated with planes seating fewer than         30 passengers (e.g., certain ""commuter"" flights         to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean). Cigar and pipe         smoking is banned on all U.S.-carrier flights (scheduled         and charter, domestic and international). The following         rules apply to U.S. airlines on flights where smoking is         not banned (e.g. international flights, domestic charter         flights). These regulations do not apply to foreign         airlines; however, most of them provide non-smoking         sections (although they may not guarantee seating there         or expand the section).           * The airline must provide a seat in a         non-smoking section to every passenger who asks for one,         as long as the passenger complies with the carrier's seat         assignment deadline and procedures. (Standby passengers         do not have this right.)            * If necessary, the airline must expand         the non- smoking section to accommodate the passengers         described above.            * The airline does not have to provide a         non-smoking seat of the passenger's choice. It doesn't         have to seat you with your traveling companion, and you         don't have the right to specify a window or aisle         non-smoking seat. Also, the airline is not required by         this rule to provide advance seat assignments before the         flight date in the non-smoking section, as long as they         get you into the non-smoking section on the day of your         flight.            * The flight crew must act to keep         passengers from smoking in the non-smoking sections.         However, smoke that drifts from the smoking section into         the non-smoking section does not constitute a violation.            * No smoking is allowed while an aircraft         is on the ground or when the ventilation system is not         fully functioning.            * Carriers are not required to have a         smoking section. An airline is free to ban smoking on a         particular flight, or on all of its flights.            None of the regulations described in this         chapter apply to charter flights performed with small         aircraft by on-demand air taxi operators.            7. PASSENGERS WITH DISABILITIES           Over 40 million Americans have         disabilities. The Air Carrier Access Act and the DOT rule         that implements it set out procedures designed to ensure         that these individuals have the same opportunity as         anyone else to enjoy a pleasant flight. Here are some of         the major provisions of the rule.            * A person may not be refused         transportation on the basis of disability or be required         to have an attendant or produce a medical certificate,         except in certain limited circumstances specified in the         rule.            * Airlines must provide enplaning,         deplaning and connecting assistance, including both         personnel and equipment. (Some small commuter aircraft         may not be accessible to passengers with severe mobility         impairments. When making plans to fly to small cities,         such passengers should check on the aircraft type and its         accessibility.)            * Airport terminals and airline         reservations centers must have TDD telephone devices for         persons with hearing or speech impairments.            * Passengers with vision or hearing         impairments must have timely access to the same         information given to other passengers at the airport or         on the plane concerning gate assignments, delayed         flights, safety, etc.            * New widebody aircraft must have a         wheelchair- accessible lavatory and an on-board         wheelchair. Airlines must put an on-board wheelchair on         most other flights upon a passenger's request (48 hours         notice required).            * Air carriers must accept wheelchairs as         checked baggage, and cannot require passengers to sign         liability waivers for them (except for pre-existing         damage).            * Most new airplanes must have movable         armrests on half the aisle seats, and on-board stowage         for one folding passenger wheelchair.            * Carriers must allow service animals to         accompany passengers in the cabin, as long as they don't         block the aisle or other emergency evacuation route.            * FAA safety rules establish standards         for passengers allowed to sit in emergency exit rows;         such persons must be able to perform certain         evacuation-related functions.            * FAA rules also prohibit passengers from         bringing their own oxygen. Most airlines will provide         aircraft-approved oxygen for a fee, but aren't required         to.            * Airlines may not charge for services         that are required by this rule.            * Airlines must make available a         specially-trained Complaints Resolution Official if a         dispute arises. There must be a copy of the DOT rule at         every airport.            It's wise to call the airline again         before your trip to reconfirm any assistance that you         have requested. For additional details, see ""Other         Sources of Information"" at the end of this pamphlet         for information on ordering the booklet New Horizons for         the Air Traveler with a Disability.            8. FREQUENT-FLYER PROGRAMS           Virtually all major U.S. airlines have a         frequent-flyer plan, and many foreign carriers are         starting them. These programs allow you to earn free         trips, upgrades (e.g., from Coach to First Class) or         other awards based on how often you fly on that airline.         In some programs you can earn credit by using specified         hotels, rental car companies, credit cards, etc. It         doesn't cost anything to join a program, and you can         enroll in the programs of any number of different         airlines. However, it may not be to your advantage to         ""put all your eggs in one basket"" with one plan         by accumulating a high mileage balance only to find out         later that another carrier's program suits your needs         better. Here are some things to look at when selecting a         frequent-flyer program.            * Does the airline fly where you're         likely to want to go?            * Are there tie-ins with other carriers,         especially those with international routes? Is some of         the airline's service provided by commuter-carrier         ""partners""? In both cases, can you earn credits         and use awards on those other airlines?            * How many miles (or trips) are required         for particular awards?            * Is there a minimum award per flight         (e.g., you are only flying 200 miles but the airline         always awards at least 500)?            * Is there a deadline for using         accumulated miles?            * Carefully examine the number and length         of any ""blackout periods"" during which awards         cannot be used. On some carriers, the Thanksgiving         blackout may last a week.            * If you are planning a big trip and are         thinking about joining that airline's frequent-flyer         program, enroll before you travel. Airlines usually won't         credit mileage that was flown before you became a member.                    After you join a program, there are other         things that you should know:           * Airlines reserve the right to make         changes to their programs, sometimes on short notice. The         number of miles required for particular awards might be         raised, requiring you to use your old mileage (i.e., your         current balance) under the more restrictive new rules.         The airline may cease service on a route that you were         particularly interested in-or it may drop the city you         live in! The carrier may eliminate attractive         frequent-flyer tie-ins with particular airlines or hotel         chains.            * Cashing in your mileage frequently will         limit your losses in case the carrier changes the rules,         merges, or goes out of business. (Some private companies         sell insurance covering some of these eventualities.)         Accumulating a larger mileage balance will entitle you to         bigger awards, however.            * Carriers often limit the number of         seats on each flight for which frequent-flyer awards can         be used. You may not be able to get reservations on your         first- or second-choice dates or flights.            * Awards can often be issued in the name         of immediate family members. However, if you sell or give         an award to someone not named on the award or the travel         document and the airline finds out, the recipient could         have his or her ticket confiscated, and the carrier may         penalize the program member's account balance.            * Ask the airline how mileage is         registered; you will probably have to identify yourself         as a program member when you book your flight or when you         check in.            * Keep your boarding passes and the         passenger coupon of your ticket until you receive a         statement from the frequent-flyer program reflecting the         correct mileage earnings for that trip. If a problem         arises, get the names of the people you speak with and         keep notes of your conversations.            9. CONTRACT TERMS           Throughout this booklet, we have tried to         provide you general information about airline travel. It         is important to realize, however, that each airline has         specific rules that make up your contract of carriage.         These rules may differ among carriers. They include         provisions such as check-in deadlines, refund procedures,         responsibility for delayed flights, and many other         things.            Domestic Travel           For domestic travel, an airline may         provide all of its contract terms on or with your ticket         at the time you buy it. Many small ""commuter""         carriers use this system. Other airlines may elect to         ""  "

However, traveling pregnantdoes come withsome warnings, such as an increased risk of blood clots and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) , especially during long flights. To ensure safe and comfortable air travel when pregnant, follow these tips from the Cheapflights team: Quick tips for healthy air travel while pregnant Be aware of dehydration on airplanes, which can be worse when youre pregnant. Make sure you have plenty of water with you, and avoid caffeine and alcohol. Pack vitamin-rich fresh fruit such as grapes, plums, oranges or dried apricots. Wear support hose and shoes with adjustable straps in case your feet swell. As always with flying, get up and walk around the cabin every two hours or so. Take an eye mask and ear plugs and wear loose, comfortable clothing. Rest as much as possible while in the air. When is the best time to fly? According to the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, air travel is safest for pregnant women during the second trimester  weeks 18 to 24. If you are considering a flight during your pregnancy, check with both your doctor and the airline before you book. General consensus in the medical community suggests it is best not to travel pregnantbefore 12 weeks due to morning sickness and possible increased risk of miscarriage. Though many pregnant women have no trouble flying in the first trimester, it is always better to err on the safe side and consult your physician. After 28 weeks, when the risk of going into labor increases, most airlines will require a letter from your doctor stating that you are fit for air travel while pregnant and confirming your estimated due date. If you are more than 36 weeks pregnant, many airlines will not let you fly due to the increased risk of delivering onboard. Each airline has its own rules for flying while pregnant If youre booking your flights with an agent, let them know that youre pregnant when you book your flight and check that you are permitted to fly. If youre booking your flights online, be sure to check the airlines Web site. It is worth telephoning ahead to alert the airline about your pregnancy  this should also ensure that you get special service to keep you comfortable& Make yourself comfortable Especially during pregnancy, reserving the right seat on the airplane can make a difference. You willneed to be able to get up and move around the plane. Try and reserve a spacious seat when you make your booking. Many airlines Web siteshave information about the varying legroom on each of their seats, or see our legroom report to find out how the different airlines size up. If you plan to travel pregnant, it's worth spending a few extra bucks to get a bit more room. Be aware though that traditional extra legroom seats, such as those on the exit aisles, are often not permitted to those who are pregnant. If you cant reserve ahead, arrive at the airport early and ask for a bulkhead seat. The bulkhead is the partition between business class and economy, for example. Its also useful to reserve an aisle seat if you can, especially if youre traveling long-distance, which will save you having to squeeze past other passengers every time you want to get out of your seat. Dont be shy. Explain that youre pregnant and ask if there is any possibility of being upgraded, or having a seat with a couple of open seats next to you. Flight insurance considerations Pregnant women can be seen as relatively high-risk, and many insurers will not provide air travel coverage if you have less than eight weeks to go before your due date. You could still claim losses unrelated to your pregnancy, but you might not be covered if you have to cancel your trip due to your pregnancy. To ensure peace of mind on flights while pregnant, look into air travel insurance. Tips for your vacation Once the flights over, its time to enjoy the vacation. Here are just a few more things to consider in pregnancy travel: Skin is more sensitive during pregnancy, so wear stronger sunscreen than usual. Keep a list of names and numbers to be contacted in case of emergency. Keep a list of local hospitals from the embassy or tourist board. Ask your doctor before embarking on any dangerous sports, such as diving or watersports. Bring your medical notes with you, in case you need to go into hospital or deliver early. Youre on the ground. Relax and enjoy yourself on what could be your last diaper-free break for a while.

It shares its borders with the countries of Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe and it is filled with an interesting array stunning scenery and attractions. The province is named after the Limpopo River which is the provinces most important river and which creates the border between South Africa and Zimbabwe. It is also known for the majestic baobab trees which grow here in abundance and which have long captured the imagination of writers, artists and travelers.    The  Limpopo Province  is a place of myth and legend. The area has a strong sense of history and culture and many ancient relics from the past may be found here. The beauty of the landscape is absolutely breathtaking and the hot, dry weather is both appreciated and despised in equal measure. This is essentially the game reserve capital of the country with literally hundreds of different private game reserves competing for customers. It is also the home of the world famous  Kruger National Park  and two ground breaking transfrontier parks  namely: The Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park and The Limpopo/Shashe Transfrontier Conservation Area. Both of these enable South Africa and other countries that share its borders to remove the borders that divide their natural habitats so that several protected natural areas can be merged to form one massive protected environment under a collaborative management. Doing this enables the national parks involved to provide a more suitable habitat for a number of animals and has made it possible to re-establish the existence of several kinds of endangered animals in these areas.     Another aspect of the province that makes it so attractive are the many wild and distinctive mountain escarpments found here. The most significant and dramatic of these is the first rise of the Drakensberg Escarpment which later goes on to sweep across the country from the northern half to the southern half. However, youll find more diversity on the woody slopes of the Letaba area, just east of  Polokwane , the provincial capital. Filled with lakes, waterfalls and forests, this part of the province makes for excellent nature walks. The Waterberg Mountains are lower and gentler than the other two. They used to serve primarily as a cattle farming and hunting area, but in the last two decades they have been altered into a beautiful wildlife conservation area. Today this area is now a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, offering malaria-free Big-Five game viewing.     Finally, the subtropical Soutpansberg Mountains offer the perfect introduction to the Venda culture. Just north of the mountains you will find the mind boggling baobab trees that have become so famous. So give the Limpopo Province a try and discover a whole new corner of Africa!

This massive city is known for its burgeoning music industry, its gold mines and its massive shopping malls. It also has centuries of history and has served as a political and cultural center for the country for decades. There is little wonder then that the city also enjoys a number of excellent theatrical productions.     Perhaps one of the main reasons why  theatre  continues to enjoy a strong following in this city is because there are so many universities and colleges in the area. Young people are encouraged to pursue any avenue of creativity that they might naturally lean towards and the result is that visual and performing arts are constantly abuzz with life. So why not enjoy the citys vibrant theatrical scene for yourself? Simply book your ticket and make your way to one of the many  theatres in Johannesburg  for a great night of entertainment!
