When the laws changed so that, for those of African ancestry, servitude followed the condition of the mother, not the father, the system of chattel slavery had begun.  The story of African American women in these times is mostly of women without names.  Phillis Wheatley is one, but not the only, exception to this enforced anonymity.

Women were quite active in the abolitionist movement. White women came out of their domestic sphere to work against the enslavement of others.

clueweb09-enwp01-65-12111	"                     Madam C. J. Walker          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Madame C. J. Walker )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                       Madam Walker in a photograph ca. 1914 by  Addison Scurlock .       Madam C.J. Walker  ( December 23 ,  1867    May 25 ,  1919 ) was an  American   businesswoman ,  hair care   entrepreneur ,  tycoon  and  philanthropist . She died after World War I.   Her fortune was made by developing and marketing a hugely successful line of beauty and hair products for black women, under the company she founded Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company. The  Guinness Book of Records  cites Walker as the first female, black or white, who became a  millionaire  by her own achievements.   In  2002 , scholar  Molefi Kete Asante  listed Madam C. J. Walker on his list of  100 Greatest African Americans . [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Biography   2   See also   3   References   4   Further reading   5   External links               Biography   She was born Sarah Breedlove in  Delta, Louisiana , the first member of her family to be born free. Her parents had been slaves. At age 14, she married a man named Moses McWilliams and was widowed at age 20. She then moved to  St. Louis, Missouri  to join her brothers. Sarah worked as a laundress for as little as a dollar and a half a day, but she was able to save enough to educate her daughter. While living in St. Louis, she joined  St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church , which helped develop her speaking, interpersonal and organizational skills. She was married in 1894 to John Davis and divorced about nine years later.   When she began to lose her hair, she had the idea for a line of hair care products. Like that of most other Americans in the early 1900s, Walker's home lacked indoor plumbing, electricity and central heating. Like many women of that era, she washed her hair only once a month. As a result, she suffered from severe  dandruff  and scalp disease that nearly caused her to go bald.   In 1905, Davis moved to  Denver, Colorado , where she worked as a sales agent for Annie Malone, another black woman entrepreneur who manufactured hair care products. Sarah also consulted with a Denver pharmacist, who analyzed Malone's formula and helped Walker formulate her own products. In addition, she often told reporters that the ingredients for her ""Wonderful Hair Grower"" had come to her in a dream.   In 1906 she married Charles Joseph Walker, a St. Louis newspaperman, and changed her name to ""Madam C.J. Walker"". She founded the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company to sell hair care products and  cosmetics . Madam Walker divorced Walker in 1910 and moved her growing manufacturing operations from St. Louis to a new industrial complex in  Indianapolis . By 1917 she had the largest business in the  United States  owned by a black person.          I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations...I have built my own factory on my own ground. [ 2 ]                 There is no royal, flower-strewn path to success. And if there is, I have not found it for if I have accomplished anything in life, it is because I have been willing to work hard. [ 2 ]          Walker saw her personal wealth not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote economic opportunities for others, especially black people. She took great pride in the profitable employment  and alternative to domestic labor  that her company afforded many thousands of black women who worked as commissioned agents. Her agents could earn from $5 to $15 per day in an era when unskilled white laborers were making about $11 per week. [ 3 ]   Marjorie Joyner , who started work as one of her employees, went on to lead the next generation of African-American beauty entrepreneurs.   Walker was known for her philanthropy, leaving two-thirds of her estate to educational institutions and charities, including the  NAACP , the  Tuskegee Institute  and  Bethune-Cookman College . In 1919, her $5,000 pledge to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign was the largest gift the organization had ever received.   Walker had a mansion called "" Villa Lewaro "" built in the wealthy New York suburb of  Irvington on Hudson, New York , near the estates of  John D. Rockefeller  and  Jay Gould . She spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furnishings. [ 4 ]  The  Italianate   villa  was designed by architect  Vertner Tandy , the first registered black  architect  in the state of New York, in 1915. Walker also owned townhouses in  Indianapolis  and New York.   Madam Walker died on May 25, 1919, at age 51, at her estate  Villa Lewaro . She passed away because of kidney failure and other complications resulting from  hypertension . She was buried at  Woodlawn Cemetery  in  the Bronx .   Her daughter  A'Lelia Walker  carried on the tradition of hospitality, opening her mother's home and her own to writers and artists of the emergent  Harlem Renaissance . She promoted important members of that movement. [ 5 ]  She converted a section of her  Harlem  townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street into the Dark Tower, a salon and tearoom where Harlem and  Greenwich Village  artists, writers and musicians gathered. Poet  Langston Hughes  called her ""The joy goddess of Harlem's 1920s"" in his autobiography  The Big Sea , because of the lavish parties she hosted in Harlem and  Irvington .

Dates:   December 23, 1867 – May 25, 1919    Occupation:   inventor, entrepreneur, philanthropist, social activist   In the early 1900s, Madam C.J. Walker was one of the most well known blacks of the time. America’s first black woman millionaire made her fortune with the invention of hair care products specifically tailored to black women.  She had a hand in revolutionizing the way black women styled their hair by combining the use of the hot comb with her hair care products.      Walker’s Early Life   On December 23, 1867, Madam C.J. Walker was born with the name Sarah Breedlove, near Delta, Louisiana on a cotton plantation.  Her parents died when she was seven years old, and Walker and her sister survived by working in the cotton fields in Vicksburg, Mississippi.  When she was fourteen, she married laborer, Moses McWilliams.  Their marriage lasted for six years, until he died in an accident.  A widow at twenty and the mother of a young daughter, Breedlove moved to St. Louis, Missouri to work as a laundress.      Walker Creates Hair Care Products   Walker began to suffer from hair loss, so she started working as a sales agent for Annie Turnbo Pope Malone’s Poro Company selling hair grower.  Realizing the great potential in beauty products for black women, Walker moved to Denver to start her own hair care business.  Walker married Charles Joseph Walker, a newspaper sales agent who later helped her advertise her products in black newspapers.   Walker invented several hair care products.  Among the product were Madam Walker's Wonderful Hair Grower and a hair softener that could be used with hot combs.  Walker traveled throughout the United States speaking about her hair care products, giving demonstrations and selling them door-to-door.  As her products became popular, she also became one of the most well known black Americans of the time.      In 1908, she opened Lelia College in Pittsburgh, which was used to train “beauty culturists.”  At Walker’s high point, she employed over three thousand workers, most of whom were door-to-door saleswomen.  For the time, they were paid well, making five to fifteen dollars per day.  In 1910, she moved her headquarters to Indianapolis.      Walker Supports Charitable and Political Causes   In addition to her business sense, she was charitable with her wealth and became involved in social and political activities.  In Indianapolis she provided the funding for the construction of a black YMCA, donated money to the  NAACP , funded the preservation of the home of  Frederick Douglass , funded scholarships for  Booker T. Washington’s  Tuskegee Institute, and donated to several other charitable institutions.     Walker also became involved in social and political activities.  In 1917, she participated in an anti-lynching protest in East St. Louis, Illinois, where three dozen blacks had been murdered by a white mob.     In 1918, her home, Villa Lewaro, in Irvington-on-Hudson, New York, designed by black architect Vertner Tandy, was completed.  One year later, Walker died of kidney disease.

She was active in preserving the memory of her husband and in political issues. She fought to make her husband's birthday, a national holiday, a dream that was realized in 1986. She was  present when President Ronald Reagan signed the legislation establishing Martin Luther King Day.      President George W.

She had a perfect life and enough sense to live it to the hilt, but then a war she didn fully understand turned everything upside down, thrusting her into a role she never wanted and was not prepared to play. Suddenly the target of angry protests aimed at the country she had never really felt was her own, Josephine is forced to return to America to see if she can create a new definition of home.

To help  celebrate this special occasion, the City of New York is sponsoring the 6th annual Poem In  Your Pocket Day on April 17, 2008. This collaboration between the NYC  Department of Education, the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Mayor’s  Office, celebrates poetry by highlighting poetry events all month. New Yorkers  are encouraged to carry a poem in their pockets and share with family, friends,  coworkers and classmates. Public schools, after-school programs, and cultural  institutions throughout the five boroughs will highlight poetry on this day  through readings by poets, poetry workshops and specifically designed lesson  plans.                                              This year, the  Poetry Society of America  and the  New  York Public Library  are working to bring John Waldman’s writing project to New York City.  Mr.  Waldman takes published poems and places them inside envelopes.  He then  writes the first line of the poem on the outside of the envelope and  distributes the envelopes, so that participants may use the first line as a  jumping off point to write their own poem.  At the end of the project, the  participants share their poems with each other, along with the published poems.                        If you are interested in participating, click  here  (in  PDF ) to  download 17 first lines from poems that are in the public domain and may be  reproduced freely.  The full poems may be downloaded  here  (in  PDF ).  To  learn more about how this extraordinary project works, click  here  (in  PDF ). And the  New York Public Library is hosting a site ( www.nypl.org/blog ) for participants to  post poems that have been written as part of this project, beginning on  Wednesday, April 16.                      Tuck a poem in your pocket and share the joys of poetry with those around you.  What will your poem be?    Be sure to look at the Events Calendar listings to find out about events for  adults, children and families celebrating the power of poems.

While living in St. Louis, she joined  St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church , which helped develop her speaking, interpersonal and organizational skills. She was married in 1894 to John Davis and divorced about nine years later.   When she began to lose her hair, she had the idea for a line of hair care products. Like that of most other Americans in the early 1900s, Walker's home lacked indoor plumbing, electricity and central heating. Like many women of that era, she washed her hair only once a month. As a result, she suffered from severe  dandruff  and scalp disease that nearly caused her to go bald.   In 1905, Davis moved to  Denver, Colorado , where she worked as a sales agent for Annie Malone, another black woman entrepreneur who manufactured hair care products. Sarah also consulted with a Denver pharmacist, who analyzed Malone's formula and helped Walker formulate her own products. In addition, she often told reporters that the ingredients for her ""Wonderful Hair Grower"" had come to her in a dream.   In 1906 she married Charles Joseph Walker, a St. Louis newspaperman, and changed her name to ""Madam C.J. Walker"". She founded the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company to sell hair care products and  cosmetics . Madam Walker divorced Walker in 1910 and moved her growing manufacturing operations from St. Louis to a new industrial complex in  Indianapolis . By 1917 she had the largest business in the  United States  owned by a black person.          I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations...I have built my own factory on my own ground. [ 2 ]                 There is no royal, flower-strewn path to success. And if there is, I have not found it for if I have accomplished anything in life, it is because I have been willing to work hard. [ 2 ]          Walker saw her personal wealth not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote economic opportunities for others, especially black people. She took great pride in the profitable employment  and alternative to domestic labor  that her company afforded many thousands of black women who worked as commissioned agents. Her agents could earn from $5 to $15 per day in an era when unskilled white laborers were making about $11 per week. [ 3 ]   Marjorie Joyner , who started work as one of her employees, went on to lead the next generation of African-American beauty entrepreneurs.   Walker was known for her philanthropy, leaving two-thirds of her estate to educational institutions and charities, including the  NAACP , the  Tuskegee Institute  and  Bethune-Cookman College . In 1919, her $5,000 pledge to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign was the largest gift the organization had ever received.   Walker had a mansion called "" Villa Lewaro "" built in the wealthy New York suburb of  Irvington on Hudson, New York , near the estates of  John D. Rockefeller  and  Jay Gould . She spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furnishings. [ 4 ]  The  Italianate   villa  was designed by architect  Vertner Tandy , the first registered black  architect  in the state of New York, in 1915. Walker also owned townhouses in  Indianapolis  and New York.   Madam Walker died on May 25, 1919, at age 51, at her estate  Villa Lewaro . She passed away because of kidney failure and other complications resulting from  hypertension . She was buried at  Woodlawn Cemetery  in  the Bronx .   Her daughter  A'Lelia Walker  carried on the tradition of hospitality, opening her mother's home and her own to writers and artists of the emergent  Harlem Renaissance . She promoted important members of that movement. [ 5 ]  She converted a section of her  Harlem  townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street into the Dark Tower, a salon and tearoom where Harlem and  Greenwich Village  artists, writers and musicians gathered. Poet  Langston Hughes  called her ""The joy goddess of Harlem's 1920s"" in his autobiography  The Big Sea , because of the lavish parties she hosted in Harlem and  Irvington .

Walker          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Madam CJ Walker )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                       Madam Walker in a photograph ca. 1914 by  Addison Scurlock .       Madam C.J. Walker  ( December 23 ,  1867    May 25 ,  1919 ) was an  American   businesswoman ,  hair care   entrepreneur ,  tycoon  and  philanthropist . She died after World War I.   Her fortune was made by developing and marketing a hugely successful line of beauty and hair products for black women, under the company she founded Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company. The  Guinness Book of Records  cites Walker as the first female who became a  millionaire  by her own achievements.   In  2002 , scholar  Molefi Kete Asante  listed Madam C. J. Walker on his list of  100 Greatest African Americans . [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Biography   2   See also   3   References   4   Further reading   5   External links               Biography   She was born Sarah Breedlove in  Delta, Louisiana , the first member of her family to be born free. Her parents had been slaves. At age 14, she married a man named Moses McWilliams and was widowed at age 20. She then moved to  St. Louis, Missouri  to join her brothers. Sarah worked as a laundress for as little as a dollar and a half a day, but she was able to save enough to educate her daughter. While living in St. Louis, she joined  St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church , which helped develop her speaking, interpersonal and organizational skills. She was married in 1894 to John Davis and divorced about nine years later.   When she began to lose her hair, she had the idea for a line of hair care products. Like that of most other Americans in the early 1900s, Walker's home lacked indoor plumbing, electricity and central heating. Like many women of that era, she washed her hair only once a month. As a result, she suffered from severe  dandruff  and scalp disease that nearly caused her to go bald.   In 1905, Davis moved to  Denver, Colorado , where she worked as a sales agent for Annie Malone, another black woman entrepreneur who manufactured hair care products. Sarah also consulted with a Denver pharmacist, who analyzed Malone's formula and helped Walker formulate her own products. In addition, she often told reporters that the ingredients for her ""Wonderful Hair Grower"" had come to her in a dream.   In 1906 she married Charles Joseph Walker, a St. Louis newspaperman, and changed her name to ""Madam C.J. Walker"". She founded the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company to sell hair care products and  cosmetics . Madam Walker divorced Walker in 1910 and moved her growing manufacturing operations from St. Louis to a new industrial complex in  Indianapolis . By 1917 she had the largest business in the  United States  owned by a black person.          I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations...I have built my own factory on my own ground. [ 2 ]                 There is no royal, flower-strewn path to success. And if there is, I have not found it for if I have accomplished anything in life, it is because I have been willing to work hard. [ 2 ]          Walker saw her personal wealth not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote economic opportunities for others, especially black people. She took great pride in the profitable employment  and alternative to domestic labor  that her company afforded many thousands of black women who worked as commissioned agents. Her agents could earn from $5 to $15 per day in an era when unskilled white laborers were making about $11 per week. [ 3 ]   Marjorie Joyner , who started work as one of her employees, went on to lead the next generation of African-American beauty entrepreneurs.   Walker was known for her philanthropy, leaving two-thirds of her estate to educational institutions and charities, including the  NAACP , the  Tuskegee Institute  and  Bethune-Cookman College . In 1919, her $5,000 pledge to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign was the largest gift the organization had ever received.   Walker had a mansion called "" Villa Lewaro "" built in the wealthy New York suburb of  Irvington on Hudson, New York , near the estates of  John D. Rockefeller  and  Jay Gould . She spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furnishings. [ 4 ]  The  Italianate   villa  was designed by architect  Vertner Tandy , the first registered black  architect  in the state of New York, in 1915. Walker also owned townhouses in  Indianapolis  and New York.   Madam Walker died on May 25, 1919, at age 51, at her estate  Villa Lewaro . She passed away because of kidney failure and other complications resulting from  hypertension . She was buried at  Woodlawn Cemetery  in  the Bronx .   Her daughter  A'Lelia Walker  carried on the tradition of hospitality, opening her mother's home and her own to writers and artists of the emergent  Harlem Renaissance . She promoted important members of that movement. [ 5 ]  She converted a section of her  Harlem  townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street into the Dark Tower, a salon and tearoom where Harlem and  Greenwich Village  artists, writers and musicians gathered. Poet  Langston Hughes  called her ""The joy goddess of Harlem's 1920s"" in his autobiography  The Big Sea , because of the lavish parties she hosted in Harlem and  Irvington .

To die, to sleep--                            No more--and by a sleep to say we end                            The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks                            That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation                            Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--                            To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,                            For in that sleep of death what dreams may come                            When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,                            Must give us pause. There's the respect                            That makes calamity of so long life.                            For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,                            Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely                            The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,                            The insolence of office, and the spurns                            That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,                            When he himself might his quietus make                            With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,                            To grunt and sweat under a weary life,                            But that the dread of something after death,                            The undiscovered country, from whose bourn                            No traveller returns, puzzles the will,                            And makes us rather bear those ills we have                            Than fly to others that we know not of?                            Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,                            And thus the native hue of resolution                            Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,                            And enterprise of great pitch and moment                            With this regard their currents turn awry                            And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now,                            The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons                            Be all my sins remembered.

The book give-away was a celebration of the third annual Poem In Your Pocket Day, when New Yorkers were encouraged to carry a poem in their pockets throughout the day to share with friends, family, and colleagues.    ""It was a beautiful day in New York, and a beautiful day for poetry,"" said Charles Flowers, Associate Director of the Academy, who was on hand to help distribute books. ""People were wide-eyed at the prospect of free poetry. They simply couldn't believe we were offering these wonderful booksames Merrill, Wislawa Szymborska, Octavio Paz, C.K. Williamsll for free.

Johnson AALBC.com         Bundles's motivational       speeches about Madam Walker and about her own career in television news       have been well-received at several conferences and institutions, including       the Smithsonian Institution, the Conference on Black Philanthropy, the       Philadelphia Free Library, Harvard University, Princeton University, the       United States Postal Service, the Council on Foundations, the Indiana       Historical Society, the National Coalition of 100 Black Women, the       National Archives, Detroit's Charles H. Wright Museum of African        American History, the New York Historical Society and the Chicago Public       Library.

In 1992 her young adult biography, Madam C. J.

Walker    Click to order via  Amazon by A'Lelia Bundles   Format:  Hardcover, 400pp.   ISBN:  0684825821   Publisher:  Simon & Schuster Trade   Pub. Date:  February  2001   On Her Own Ground  is the first full-scale, definitive biography of Madam C. J. Walker the legendary African American entrepreneur and philanthropist by her great-great-granddaughter, A'Lelia Bundles.   The daughter of slaves, Madam C. J. Walker was orphaned at seven, married at fourteen and widowed at twenty. She spent the better part of the next two decades laboring as a washerwoman for $1.50 a week. Then with the discovery of a revolutionary hair care formula for black women everything changed. By her death in 1919, Walker managed to overcome astonishing odds: building a storied beauty empire from the ground up, amassing wealth unprecedented among black women and devoting her life to philanthropy and social activism. Along the way, she formed friendships with great early-twentieth-century politi-cal figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington.   On Her Own Ground   is not only the first comprehensive biography of one of recent history's most amazing entrepreneurs and philanthropists, it is about a woman who is truly an African American icon. Drawn from more than two decades of exhaustive research, the book is enriched by the author's exclusive access to personal letters, records and never-before-seen photographs from the family collection. Bundles also showcases Walker's complex relationship with her daughter, A'Lelia Walker, a celebrated hostess of the  Harlem Renaissance  and renowned friend to both  Langston Hughes  and  Zora Neale Hurston . In chapters such as ""Freedom Baby,"" ""Motherless Child,"" ""Bold Moves"" and ""Black Metropolis,"" Bundles traces her ancestor's improbable rise to the top of an international hair care empire that would be run by four generations of Walker women until its sale in 1985. Along the way,  On Her Own Ground  reveals surprising insights, tells fascinating stories and dispels many misconceptions.    On Her Own Ground was named a 2002 BCALA Honor Book, a 2001 New York Times Notable Book and the 2001 Letitia Woods Brown Book Prize winner for the Best Book on Black Women's History by the Association of Black Women Historians. It has become a favorite of women's book clubs and was one of the Go On Girl! Book Club selections for 2001. It is being taught in high schools, colleges and even in the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility's college course for women prisoners.   Related Links   MADAM C. J.

clueweb09-en0006-68-02547	   Third AURA Congress    Alice Springs 2000, Australia    10 to 14 July         The Australian Rock    Art Research Association -  AURA    Millenium: a fresh start    The Third AURA Congress will be held in Alice Springs, central Australia, from Monday, 10 July to Friday, 14 July 2000. It will be preceded and followed by a major program of field trips covering much of the continent of Australia. The Congress is to include the Annual IFRAO Meeting, the Annual General Meeting of AURA and other events. The academic sessions are to include the following symposia.    Call for papers    Papers are invited now for the following symposia of the Third AURA Congress. Paper titles and abstracts can be submitted either to one of the Symposium Chairs listed below or to the Editor of  Rock Art Research.  Papers accepted for presentation will be published.              ROCK ART AND COLONIALISM : SOUTH AFRICA, AUSTRALIA AND BEYOND    Chaired by Sven Ouzman and Claire Smith         This session will discuss some of the theoretical and methodological issues linking rock art and colonialism. The primary geographic foci of the session will be South Africa and Australia, though papers dealing with this theme in other geographic regions will be considered.    South Africa and Australia are both countries with rich, varied rock art traditions. Though these traditions differ in terms of their visual appearance and often their subject matter, both were, at various stages, part of a resistance and protest against the colonisation of their countries by non-hunter-gatherers. In fact, South Africa and Australia share some remarkable parallels in the process, negotiation and outcome of their respective colonial experiences. These experiences found expression in many forms - protests, poems, songs and also in the form of rock art.    We do not contend that the rock art imagery concerned with colonialism was a passive reflection of events, rather that those very images were powerful things in themselves. Rock art is an active medium that can serve as a powerful critique. For example, in southern African rock art white colonists are often depicted in the aggressive 'hands-on-hips' posture and are often associated with lions - powerful anti-social forces in hunter-gatherer belief.    Rock art, because it pre-existed colonialism and was acceptably situated within the world of 'traditional' hunter-gatherer activity, enjoyed a certain moral and symbolic 'weight' or legitimation. Further, because hunter-gatherer rock art in both Australia and South Africa niost often was made by respected individuals - individuals who were often symbolically literate and politically astute - it was capable of commenting on a given colonial experience, suggesting a way of acting, or reacting to this experience and of forming part of this experience. The act of painting or engraving itself could have a cathartic, calming effect though it could just as easily stir people to violent, decisive action. In some cases, as with sorcery paintings whose aim was to Vill or seriously injure particular individuals, the act of painting itself was a violent, decisive action.    At other times, the advent of colonialism created rock art traditions, such as among the Northern Sotho black farming communities of South Africa. Here a whole new rock art tradition was established with the function of ridiculing the white colonists. For example, the white women's mid-calf length dresses, immodest in comparison with Sotho women's belowthe-ankle length dresses - were painted as mini skirts so short that they would shame even modern porn stars.    The Australian situation demonstrates that colonialism is not an inevitable death-knell to the contemporary practice of indigenous rock arts. Apart from occasional examples of contemporary rock painting, in some regions rock art traditions have been transferred to other media, such as with the painting of Wandjina images on board in the Kimberley region of Australia, or the painting of rock art images on canvas and paper in various parts of Arnhem Land in northern Australia. In South Africa, too, the traditional forms and themes of rock art are sometimes depicted in contemporary Bushman art, through using acrylic paint on board and through print-making and painting on cloth.    Colonialism assumes many guises and no doubt even happened thousands of years ago within hunter-gatherer landscapes in which people moved around, sometimes displacing others. These instances of hunter-gatherer colonialism are often difficult to detect and represent a future avenue of research best assisted by a study of rock art. Rock art is currently the most informed category of material culture with which to investigate these issues. Our hope is that the papers in this session will demonstrate the ability of rock art studies to give us a deeper, more sensitised understanding of the colonial experiences of Indigenous peoples.      Abstracts (100-150 words) and paper titles are invited now and should be submitted to one of the symposium chairpersons:    Sven Otizman   :  Rock Art Department - National Museum - P.O.

Ours is a world where place is defined - 'wilderness', 'grazing land', 'residential land' - by the values and meanings we ascribe to our surroundings. It is not just an external world that we map in geographical space. It is, rather, our relationships and familiarity with, and our perceptions of, places that are charted. In the process we attribute meaning to, we define, we construct and transform abstract space to the theatre of our lives. History is in this way positioned to address not so much the nature and dynamics of outside realities, but of people's relationships with their surroundings, of their social and physical environments as perceived and culturally constructed. History, like geography, is about tracing the landscapes of the mind.    What is the role of rock art in marking, negotiating and reproducing this constructed world? Fixed on the ground, how does rock art operate in the (re)construction of landscapes, not as outside realities but as territory - owned, contextualised and continuously renegotiated space? This session aims to explore various dimensions of rock art as actively positioned in ontological space and in the construction of identities.

This challenge involves all the countries of the world, both the industrialised nations and the developing ones: all the people, all the citizens, need to adopt a strong, new ethical and moral state of mind. Human culture at the threshold of the third millennium must be called into question, because extraordinary cultural change is required, comparable to that which accompanied the 'Neolithic Revolution', and the Industrial Revolution of the 17th century.    The new imperative is 'sustainable development'; this calls for a new conjugation between environment and development, so that our current needs can be satisfied without preventing the next generations from having an improved quality of life. In the uncertain march toward the new culture, intellectuals, scholars and scientists must play the role of pioneers and vanguards.    Rock art comprises the most ancient signs of human spirituality, and those which are most widespread in every continent, but it is also one of the most fragile resources of cultural property; it must be conserved and studied. Many important rock art areas are located in developing countries. The economic development and the exploitation of the environmental resources of a territory must take its cultural heritage into consideration, and not pose a threat to conservation. Political and economic programs for the regional development of rural and urban areas must take rock art and archaeological sites into consideration, since these constitute a factor in the wealth and sustainable development of the local communities as well as of the country as a whole. The scientific, administrative and political authorities of every country and every region must commit themselves to the creation and planning of projects in sustainable development centred on 'Rock art and the environment'. Some points can be considered indispensable in these regional projects:        Consultation with, and involvement of, rock art's international authorities, and particularly IFRAO, the International Federation of Rock Art Organisations.        Involvement of national and regional rock art organisations. Drafting of regional programs of research, study, scientific documentation, preservation and conservation of rock art.          Programs for site development, cultural diffusion and regional economic-tourism development.        Training programs for school and university teachers, and for those in cultural or tourism posts who could be employed as guardians or guides for the sites, parks, museums and tourist resorts.    Regional projects in sustainable development should enable the local communities to launch processes of social and economical development through respect for the environment, in order to guarantee the future.    All rock art experts, scholars and specialists in development are invited to contribute to this symposium which represents a new opportunity for the 3rd millennium: we want to preserve not only our natural environment, but also our rock art for the human race, for our children and our children's children. Paper titles and abstracts (100-150 words) to be sent to:    Professor Dario Seglie:  Museum of Prehistoric Art - Viale Giolitti 1 - 10064 PINEROLO - Italy - Tel. +39 - 0121794382;   Fax +39 - 012175547    E-mail:   CeSMAP@cesmap.it         ROCK ART EDUCATION AND ETHICS    Chaired by Dario Seglie, Giriraj Kumar and Mike Morwood.    Education of the public on rock art is 'ethics' and 'preventive conservation' in action; it may prevent vandalism and other destructive actions at sites. Furthermore, it should be seen as one of the principal objects of the researcher to communicate the results of investigations in such a form that the general public benefits from this experience and accepts rock as an important part of the cultural heritage. Rock art education plays a prominent role in activities of rock art associations, universities, institutes, parks, centres, worldwide, and has been treated in sessions held at the international Rock Art Congresses at Turin/Italy (1995), Swakopmund/Namibia (1996), Cochabamba/Bolivia (1997), Vila Real/ Portugal (1998) and Ripon/U.S.A. (1999). The new symposium, to be held at AURA 2000 at Alice Springs, Australia, will be the opportunity to present the considerable experience acquired all over the world in a final forum which also encompasses all ideas, providing guidelines for efficient educational work on rock art in the 21st century. Papers presented in this symposium should:         focus on long-term work instead of isolated activities, taking into account publications for the general public, permanent exhibitions, lectures, hands-on activities with children etc.; detail collaboration with teachers' training centres, with museums and with administrators of rock art sites which are open for visits by the public;          consider group-specific approaches to rock art, such as different educational programs for specific age groups;         if possible, exemplify work with indigenous groups making them conscious of rock art as their cultural heritage;         evaluate the results of educational programs by providing some parameters such as comparison with areas where no rock art education has taken place, investigation of visitor behaviour at sites before and after educational programs were initiated, etc.    Possible contributors are investigators, researchers, scholars, teachers, journalists, editors etc. who have undertaken educational projects on rock art anywhere in the world. Paper titles and abstracts (100-150 words) to be sent to Professor Dario Seglie (see previous item).                ROCK ART MANAGEMENT AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR SITE VISITORS   Chaired by Natalie Franklin and Elena Miklashevich    Sound management of rock art sites which are open to public visitation includes the application of both specific technical methods for conservation and of various techniques for visitor control. It has become clear in recent years that the latter in particular, combined with appropriate public education about rock art, can reduce the chances of vandalism and inadvertent damage to rock art sites, lessen the impact of visitation upon the surrounding environment, and enhance visitor appreciation of the art. Increasingly research is showing that visitors are less likely to cause damage to rock art sites if they are aware of their value. Education has a key role to play in the recognition of site value. If education programs about rock art sites are effectively achieved, cultural heritage in general will become a valued dimension of everyday life and will be treated with the respect and care necessary to ensure its preservation for future generations. Appropriate and effective education about rock art is therefore essential for its protection against damage caused by visitors.    This symposium will consider the management of publicly visited rock art sites within the context of education programs which are aimed at fostering site protection. The issues which might be discussed in the symposium include, but need not be limited to:         the involvement of indigenous people in education programs about rock art sites and regions; the aspects visitors look for in guided tours and site information;         research into public perceptions of rock art and how these might be 'managed';         research on the evaluation of educative strategies at rock art sites (e.g. visitor surveys);         how to balance indigenous and scientific perspectives of rock art for the public; the design of educative strategies in order to meet the needs of a range of audiences;         and the ways in which appropriate education programs have enhanced visitor appreciation of rock art and assisted in the protection of sites.    Papers on case studies which detail innovative strategies for the education of publicly visited rock art sites are particularly welcome. Papers should include discussion of the methods which have worked, and those which have not, at particular sites or regions.    Paper titles and abstracts (up to 150 words) are invited and should be forwarded to either of these:    Dr Natalie Franklin:  Cultural Heritage Branch - Environmental Planning Division - Environmental Protection - Agency - P.O.

This symposium aims to promote the recognition and protection of indigenous values and to aspire to die goals of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in demonstrating a commitment to seek 'consensus, co-operation, mediation and dialogue' (see Dodson 1994). In response to Recommendation 10 of the Cairns Declaration document (1992), the symposium aims to provide an appropriate format in which the conference can benefit from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation. Therefore a variety of presentation approaches is envisaged with the possibility of a forum to encourage maximum participation.    In response to this preliminary announcement we invite proposals or suggestions for symposium structure, content or presentations relating to the recognition and protection of indigenous values in rock art research.

Campbell@jcu.edu.au           AESTHETICS OF ROCK ART    Thomas Heyd and John Clegg    Very significant progress has been made in recent years in the cultural and scientific understanding of rock art with regard to:        1. Appreciation of the civilisations and cultures of its makers and users; and        2. Formal archaeology's understanding of materials, dating techniques, and so on.    In the meantime almost nothing has been said about rock art from the point of view of aesthetics. Given the outstanding cultural importance of rock art, and as a reminder of the presence of autochthonous peoples in the land, it is imperative that serious thought be given to the sort of appreciation to which rock art lends itself.    This symposium will be an opportunity for theoretically well-founded and empirically supported, interdisciplinary exploration of the aesthetic values represented in rock art. In so far as it will be a follow-up on the  Aesthetics and rock art symposium  held at IRAC 1998 in Vila Real, we expect to be building on the papers presented there. (For an example of the approach proposed see 'Rock art aesthetics: trace on rock, mark of spirit, window on land',  Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism,  forthcoming).    Papers addressing the aesthetics of rock art are welcome. In particular we seek papers that seek to:        • clarify the source of the aesthetic appeal of rock art;        • the problem of cross-cultural and cross-temporal aesthetic appreciation;        • the history of rock art aesthetics;          * the achievements of those who made and those who used rock art.    Please provide the title of your paper and a 100 - 150 word abstract to one of the co-ordinators as soon as possible.

Johnson gathered together a large number of indigenous stories, ancestral realities, seasonal relationships and ceremonial traditions from Australian sources. Particular rock art sites and figures are also given night sky relation by certain custodians in central and northern Australia. This symposium invites researchers working with indigenous communities worldwide and in Australia, together with custodians of sky-related art sites, astronomers, philosophers of science, historians, archaeo-astronomers and students of human conceptual, intellectual and spiritual realities to contribute:        1.  To increase the data known from indigenous worlds relating to the night sky.        2. To understand more fully these astronomies in their complexities.        3. To allow indigenous spiritual sensibilities for the whole cosmos to be heard.        4. To develop recognition of astronomical relationships at rock art sites.

Recent research with a dual input from custodians and archaeological or anthropological researchers has revealed that the symbolic imagery of animal figures and geometric or abstract motifs function as concepts beyond a visual record of events. The symposium will centre on the spirituality and belief connections with the imagery on the rock surface. Papers will reflect the belief expressions of the traditional culture of the makers of the images or the perceptions that emanate out of the images and were adapted by other users for their belief systems. It is recognised that specific images painted or engraved on stone reach into ancestral connections and spiritual presence that relate to the cosmos of a community.    Participation is anticipated from Aboriginal Australia and southern Africans, as well as American Indians and South American peoples, northern Africans, European and Asian nations.

It will attempt to understand human perceptions of nature through exploration of graphic, expressive culture. Ecological knowledge includes those aspects of culture that relate to environmental concerns directly (e.g. resource exploitation) and indirectly (e.g. totemic proscriptions). Thus, ecological knowledge affects subsistence, adaptation, cosmology and aesthetics, and these things in turn affect the knowledge base. By investigating the ethno-ecology of rock art, we can gain greater understanding of critical interactions between humans and the natural world.    In this symposium we will study beliefs about the relationship between humans and the natural environment as expressed through rock art, and we will explore where these cultural systems of knowing intersect and diverge. This symposium will seek insight into how aspects of cultural ecology are expressed through the symbolic medium of rock art, and will investigate the intersection between the external world and cultural con~ structions; of that world. It will, essentially, strive to understand the mechanisms through which the world makes cultural sense.    Traditional ecological knowledge is being lost rapidly as elders die and their cultures undergo tremendous change. Recording, understanding and appreciating this knowledge (ethno-ecology) is thus an urgent matter. To interpret traditional ecological knowledge with care and in the interest of its possessors is one goal of this symposium. It seeks, through its inquiry into rock art, to illuminate diverse cultural interactions with Nature, thereby giving us greater appreciation of the depth and scope of knowledge systems as they relate to the natural environment. Vignettes of indigenous understandings of the natural world are precious in their own right, but they also provide potential foundations for a new environmental ethic that we so urgently need.    Contrary to popular notions, indigenous peoples traditionally and significantly manipulate natural resources. Many indigenous peoples engage in a practice of participation and reciprocity with the land. Their ethics, generally, are based on cosmologies of shared identity between humans and landscape, and facilitate the maintenance of diverse resource bases. Rock art often documents and helps articulate a moral ecology, one predicated on the shared responsibility between people and the land. In most indigenous cosmologies, the human and nonhuman are interdependent, and ecological limits, restraints, and responsibilities are readily apparent and part of the nature of being. The norm is that indigenous cultuial ecologies are based on beliefs in the intrinsic value of the land and all that it contains. Romanticised notions of traditional ecological knowledge, however, will help neither the people themselves nor the lands they inhabit, and a realistic assessment of environmental knowledge is essential for appropriate and effective conservation.    Rock art documents elements of the vast environmental knowledge of many indigenous peoples, and recent work in this area suggests the value of this knowledge in addressing contemporary socio-ecological problems and sheds light on diverse ontologies of knowledge. Indigenous perceptions of nature, as expressed through social and cultural processes (including rock art), enrich our collective environmental understanding by providing regional specificity to global issues. Likewise, the ethno-ecology of rock art can benefit indigenous peoples by helping them gain greater political and economic control over their lands through claiming and exercising unique and relevant ecological knowledge. Community-based conservation techniques are not only effective strategies, but are internationally validated approaches to conservation that can bolster local resource management. Rock art can provide insight into past environmental ideologies and management practices, and can give us greater appreciation of the options available in addressing contemporary concerns.    The symposium 'Rock art and ecological knowledge' strives to increase our understanding and appreciation of the significance of environmental concerns in rock art. It explores how the physical world is the backdrop for expressive culture that relates to the interface between humans and Nature. Proposals for papers that address this central issue are solicited. We hope to solicit a diversity of approaches and case studies. While the specifics of the symposium are still being considered, it will be structured so as to facilitate dialogue and discussion; it will be participatory and may very well include some type of 'round-table' colloquy.    The main question the symposium seeks to address is: how can rock art studies shed light on diverse cultural ecologies? One approach to organising a paper around this theme that presenters may consider is to begin with this question, presenting one's data, and then returning to the question in their concluding section. Another approach would be to use a particular case study as a window onto the inquest, focusing on the ecological question throughout the paper. Presenters are asked to address the above question in insightful and creative ways.    Dr Paul Faulstich :  Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies - Pitzer College - Claremont, CA 91711- U. S.

As the sub-title of the Congress is 'Millennium: a fresh start' it seems appropriate that potential speakers not only look back at the history of rock art dating, but also to the future. New ideas and approaches to the relative and absolute dating of paintings and petroglyphs are welcome This forum will be a venue for discussing controversial issues and raising awareness about the ethics, problems and potential values of dating rock art. Paper titles and abstracts (up to 150 words long) are invited and should be submitted to one of the following:    Dr Alan Watchman :  School of Anthropology and Archaeology - Faculty of Social Sciences - James Cook University - Townsville, Qld 4811 - Australia - Tel.: 61 (07) 47 815155 - Fax: 61 (07) 47 815244      E-mail :   Alan.Watchman@jcu.edu.au    Professor Marvin Rowe and Dr Marian Hyman :  Department of Chemistry - Texas A&M University - College Station, TX 77843-3255 - U.

Chakravarty    Epistemology explores the nature and origin of knowledge, and in the case of humans this refers to human knowledge: how was it acquired? There is no reason that human constructs of reality, including that experienced by ourselves, need to be valid definitions of the real world. Indeed, our confidence in our own world view, which might involve concepts of time and threedimensional linear space, is misplaced, because there is no evolutionary reason to assume that the cognition of any intelligent species, such as humans, would necessarily evolve towards a better construct of reality. This is not the purpose of evolution.    Rather, human societies are likely to have developed constructs of reality, which in some way led to those held today. The only record that exists of these past conceptual artefacts is that which might be reflected in non-utilitarian residues of cultural remains, especially in rock art. In this symposium we wish to focus on the role of rock art in exploring the epistemologies of past human societies.    This is an extremely difficult pursuit, because it assumes that a contemporary intelligent organism, which barely understands the relativity of its own construct of reality, could effectively examine the constructs of previous peoples. Nevertheless, without formulating these problems we are not likely to free ourselves of the epistemological limitations imposed by our own world view, or to effectively study the manifestations of the world-views of others as reflected in rock arts.    There is a second, less sophisticated topic we wish to address in this symposium. Epistemology must also explore the nature of the data our ideas about a particular subject are derived from. The interpretation of empirical data about rock art needs to be conducted within the framework of a universal theory that expresses the relative position of any data by reference to absolutes. The universal theory about rock art, and any other discipline that deals with phenomena of the past and the processes rendering them interpretable, is metamorphology. A major factor of metamorphological procedure is taphonomic logic, the form of logic that treats evidence as systematically distorted and seeks to understand these distortions in order to introduce epistemological veracity into interpretation.    We invite papers on both of these topics. In view of the complexity of the topics we will not impose rigid time limits on presentations, and this symposium may be conducted in a workshop-like style. The lengths of papers should be commensurate with the complexity of the presenter's argument. Paper titles and abstracts (preferably of 100-150 words) are invited, and should be sent to either of these:    R. G. Bednarik :  Editor, IFRAO and AURA - P.O.

The aim  of  our symposium was to provide a general survey  of  the discoveries and advances in rock art studies over the previous five years. For these reasons we invited twenty-seven contributors from fifteen different parts  of  the world, but at the end  of  the symposium we realised that, on the next occasion, it would be better to create more subdivisions  of  some continents. So the  News of the World II  at the IRAC 2000 will cover twenty-four different regional or thematic areas, in each of which one or more scholars will present an overall summary  of  the discoveries  of  the last five years (19951999).    These papers will try to avoid historical introductions (as these were already included in the first volume), pet theories and skewed accounts. The texts will be in English, with concise summaries in Spanish and French  if  possible.    In addition to these invited contributions the News  of  the World 11 symposium invites anyone interested to send (or bring) a poster display regarding very recent (1995-1999) rock art discoveries or projects that have some archaeological relevance, avoiding general overviews since these are covered by the papers of other symposia.    The News  of  the World Symposium is a closed session  of  invited papers only, therefore this is not a 'Call for papers' but a 'Call for posters' only.

The month of February was selected in deference to Frederick Douglass and  Abraham Lincoln  who were both born in that month.   The son of a slave, Carter G. Woodson was born in New Canton, Virginia on December 19, 1875. He began high school at the age of 20 and then proceeded to study at Berea College, the University of Chicago, the Sorbonne, and Harvard University, where he earned a Ph.D. in 1912.   Carter G. Woodson founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in 1915 to train Black historians and to collect, preserve, and publish documents on Black life and Black people. He also founded the Journal of Negro History (1916), Associated Publishers (1922), and the Negro Bulletin (1937). Woodson spent his life working to educate all people about the vast contributions made by Black men and women throughout history. Mr. Woodson died on April 3, 1950 and Black History Month is his legacy.   Carter G. Woodson, however, would be sad to know that out of all the hundreds of Black men and women who produced so many substantial inventions (from the development of crop rotation, the traffic light, the mail box, gas mask, fountain pen, typewriter, telegraph, golf tee, automatic gear shift, commode toilet--- to the method of dry cleaning clothes, the electric lamp, and the automatic car coupler and air brake for the railroad) benefiting this country, only four Black inventors have been inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio.   During the last four years, the Patent and Trademark Office has been working closely with the National Inventors Hall of Fame Foundation to rectify this situation and honor the true story of Black History.   The four black inventors inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame are:       George Washington Carver  - Inducted in 1990      Percy Lavon Julian  - Inducted in 1990      Mark Dean  - Inducted in 1997      James E.

clueweb09-en0003-31-04334	     Some Knowledge   A Magazine of Information and Opinion, written and edited by William J Remski         Archive for the ‘poetry’ Category     How to Lose Money With Poetry   without comments       First, go to poetry.com and enter a poem in the free contest. Then, wait for the letter in the mail. The letter will inform you that your poem is great and that you have been selected for inclusion in an anthology. You will only have to pay $50 for your copy of the book, $75 if you want to include a short biography of yourself.   Then, wait for the invitation to the “Poet of the Year” awards. You will have to pay $595 for a ticket to this event. You will also have to pay travel and lodging out of pocket. Of course, there will be a prize for poet of the year. Pay the company and go to the event, where you will be crowded in with all the other suckers, err, poets, and eventually somebody will be picked to win the award.   This contest and the resulting shakedown are the product of a subsidy publishing company. They are in the business of making money off of authors, not book buyers. If you really want to lose money and self respect, check out these people. They have been doing this for over ten years, and somehow what they do is not technically illegal. Perhaps you might want to run your own poetry contest. If it works for these guys, it might work for you.

The city is encouraging residents to carry a peom in their pockets to share with friends, family, and coworkers. Since April is national poetry month, this is another attempt to popularize poetry.   While it is all well and good to support literature and try to make poetry more popular, I really doubt that a lot of people will actually participate in this celebration of verse. If you walk up to your friends and start reading them a poem, or recite a poem from memory they are likely to think you’ve gone a little insane. Poetry is not a usual form of communication. I suppose if you justify your oddity by stating that it’s Poem in Your Pocket Day and have the imprimateur of the city council to back up your strangeness, it might not seem so weird to people to be reading them a poem.   It’s nice that people are trying to popularize poetry. Still, all poems are not the same. You might have problems reciting epic poetry. It’s kind of long. You might get in trouble reciting some of the modern poet’s works, as they tend to contain occasional obscenities. You might piss some people off if you start reading them slam poetry. Still, the idea is nice.   Maybe this will start a new cultural phenomenon. Maybe people will start carrying their favorite poems around with them to read to bored strangers at the bus stop. Maybe people drinking in bars will recite classic poetry to each other over beers instead of just staring at the television and cheering on the game. It would be a different world. It would be a strange world. It would be a more interesting world.   I’m all for poetry and think that everyone should write their own. Maybe in the future people will begin to speak in verse when they talk to each other. Language could sure stand an injection of musicality. I think having poetry days and poetry months is all very nice. It would be nicer if people actually went to the trouble to read poetry and bought books of poetry. It would be cool if people went to coffee shops to hear poets read their works. It would be nice if we could all go to performances and readings of some of the great poets of all time. Still, a little bit of poetry in life is maybe something interesting to start with.

Although the writings of the classical Greeks and their Roman and Arabic successors remain the foundation of western philosophy and science of music, as well as their sometimes problematic applications to architecture and other constructive arts, there has been a steady renewal of interest in the old science of harmonics, and it is recognized that much of the Greek theory and practice of harmonics was unquestionably derived from earlier cultures, the still shadowy predecessors of Pythagoras. Though hardly any modern writers would describe themselves as Pythagoreans, some of their ideas have important connections with the old tradition and all are symptomatic of a new era in the history of thought when mechanistic and reductionist paradigms are giving way to a holistic and organic world-view. Modern scholarship has established that most of the doctrines traditionally ascribed to Pythagoras were really the contributions of the older high civilisations, particularly of Mespotamia and Egypt. The rise and dissemination of these perennially influential doctrines remains one of the most formidable problems for the historian of ideas. Graham Pont.                                                        Philosophy and Science of Music in Ancient Greece: The Predecessors of Pythagoras and their Contribution                       Graham Pont 41     Forbes Street      Newtown, NSW 2042  AUSTRALIA        INTRODUCTION O ne of the ironies of twentieth-century     thought is that the final dethronement of Pythagoras as a 'father'     of western science and philosophy and the 'inventor' of music     and mathematics should be accompanied by a world-wide revival     of Pythagorean research and speculation. During the seventeenth     century, the 'harmony of the spheres', which had remained an     article of faith until the age of Shakespeare and even Louis     XIV [Isherwood 1973, Ch. 1], was suddenly overwhelmed by the     mighty discoveries of Kepler and Newton; but this traumatic 'Untuning     of the Sky' [Hollander 1970] did not entirely obliterate the     Pythagorean tradition (to which both Kepler and Newton were sympathetic).        Since the pioneering studies of Thomas Taylor (1758-1835),     Antoine Fabre d'Olivet (1767-1825) and Albert von Thimus (1806-1878),     there has been a steady renewal of interest in the old science     of harmonics, culminating in the work of Hans Kayser (1891-1964)     and his two most influential successors, Rudolf Haase and Ernest     G. McClain (both of whom are living in retirement). Neo-pythagoreanism     is now a conspicuous feature of post-modern philosophy and science:     the revival of  musica speculativa , part of a larger resurgence     of neo-classicism, is well represented in the writings of Joscelyn     Godwin [Godwin 1987, 1993, etc.]. To his extensive bibliographies     could be added not only impressive results of recent mainstream     research into Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans, e.g., Huffman     [1993], but also the publications of several 'alternative' thinkers,     including the French-American composer, music theorist, and astrologer,     Dane Rudhyar, the French 'neo-astrologer' Michel Gauquelin, the     English numerologist John Michell, and the English geneticist     Rupert Sheldrake. Sheldrake's notion of 'morphic resonance' --     forms resonating in Nature's memory -- is a very Pythagorean-Platonic     alternative to mechanistic causality. His wife, Jill Purce, is     a music therapist [Purce 1974]; so both sides of the Pythagorean     tradition -- the 'hard' and the 'soft' sciences -- are here reunited     in the work of one family.        Though hardly any of these writers would describe themselves     as Pythagoreans, their ideas have important connections with     the old tradition and all are symptomatic of a new era in the     history of thought when mechanistic and reductionist paradigms     are giving way to a holistic and organic world-view. This emergent     rationality is fundamentally ecological and its impact is being     felt from metaphysics to everyday manners. The new paradigms     of the Age of Ecology are already transforming the professions,     sciences, arts, academic disciplines, and human enterprises generally     -- from the minute study of bird-song and insect music to the     utopian vision of planet Earth designed and managed as a single,     organic  Gesamtkunstwerk  [Pont 1997].        Central to this new understanding of the world is the concept     of the 'Biosphere', which is the very antithesis of Newton's     mechanistic universe [Teilhard de Chardin 1955]. Thus the Pythagorean     vision of the living cosmos -- or Plato's 'World Soul' -- has     reappeared in new vitalist theories, including the Gaia hypothesis     of James E. Lovelock [1979]. The modern world-view and its vast     astronomical time-frame have changed our conception of humanity     itself, if only in recognising our evolutionary affiliations     with, and biological dependence on, other species in the terrestrial     ecosystem. And it has also transformed the idea of the 'humanities':     never again can they be taught as just a narrow study of the     'classical' texts or  litterae   humaniores  of Greece,     Rome, and the Renaissance. No longer can the ancient Greeks be     contemplated, in museum-like isolation, as perfect models of     everything European.        With the growth of modern archaeology, prehistory, anthropology,     linguistics, and other comparative studies, the marmoreal idols     of Eurocentric scholarship are now revealed in something like     their original gaudy splendour -- a Joseph's coat of distinctly     oriental hues. Most of the discoveries traditionally ascribed     to Pythagoras were Asiatic in origin; and, in a recent survey,      Music and Musicians in Ancient Greece  [Anderson 1994],     the Pythagoreans have been reduced to four passing references     and Pythagoras himself is omitted altogether!        The innovations still plausibly credited to the historical     Pythagoras include the coining of the terms 'philosophy' and     'theory' which, in his case, must have referred to the dogmatic     teachings and pre-scientific wisdom of a guru rather than genuinely     theoretical inquiries like those of Heraclitus and the Eleatics.     Pythagoras was also credited with inventing the term  Kosmos ,     but the idea of the beautiful world-order (above and below) must     surely have been Egyptian in origin [Cf. Plato,  Laws  II,     656a-657b]. Our admiration of the Greeks is now tempered by a     better understanding of their true historical circumstance and     actual indebtedness to other civilisations [Cf. Bernal 1987].        Just as Whitehead saw western philosophy as 'a series of footnotes     to Plato', so modern scholarship has established that most of     the doctrines traditionally ascribed to Pythagoras were really     the contributions of the older high civilisations, particularly     of Mespotamia and Egypt.[ 1 ]     The rise and dissemination of these perennially influential doctrines     remains one of the most formidable problems for the historian     of ideas.        Many of these ideas had already been explored in my General     Studies courses at the University of New South Wales, particularly     in 'The Philosophy of Music' (Australia's first academic course     on the subject, 1974-1988) and, more recently, in shorter courses     on 'Ancient Rationality' and 'Modern Rationality' (1988-1995).     It was with their arguments and conclusions in mind that I undertook     during 1997 my last course at the University, entitled 'The Predecessors     of Pythagoras'. This aimed to examine the origins and analogies     of Pythagorean traditions in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and India.     The lectures contained little that was new and the literature     survey was, unavoidably, far from exhaustive; but, even so, the     course had the unintended effect of changing the lecturer's point     of view -- and, indeed, his whole approach to Greek philosophy     and science of music.        Instead of burdening the class with the meagre texts of the     early Pythagorean school and the interminable difficulties of     their interpretation, lectures took a broad view of ancient history     and prehistory, in an attempt to answer two very large and necessarily     speculative questions: first, what might have been the origins     of the famous 'analogy of the macrocosm and the microcosm'? And,     second, how and when was this world-view 'mathematised'? -- that     is, when was it precisely articulated with a system of musical     numbers or harmonic ratios that eventually constituted the 'harmony     of the spheres'? Most of the fifteen students had some background     in history and philosophy of science but no prior musical knowledge     was required for the course and readings had to be confined to     material available in English. The only set text was  The Pythagorean     Sourcebook and Library  [Guthrie 1987].        AS ABOVE SO BELOW T he division of the world into different     levels (upper, middle, lower or Heaven, Earth and Hell) goes     back to the prehistoric shamans who practised their magic for     thousands of years before the appearance of organised religion.     As F.M. Cornford [1952] and Mircea Eliade [1964] have made clear,     the magical powers ascribed to Orpheus, Pythagoras, and other     pre-Socratic sages (even Socrates himself) were recognisably     shamanic [Cornford 1952, 107ff].[ 2 ] These included the art of healing     through music; of communicating with and taking the form of other     animals, especially birds [Guthrie 1987, 71, 127]; the ability     to fly and to appear in two places at once;[ 3 ] and the Orphic control of human passions,     brute animals and nature itself. Early biographers repeated stories     of how Pythagoras 'chased away a pestilence, suppressed violent     winds and hail, calmed storms both on rivers and on seas…'     [Guthrie 1987, 70ff., 128-9].[ 4 ] Such marvelous feats have been ascribed     to shamans world-wide, including Aboriginal Australia.        Antipodean precedents to, or analogies with, the cosmology     of the northern hemisphere include the dualism of the upper and     lower worlds (the former being occupied, as in Christian belief,     by the gods and the spirits of the departed); also common to     both mythologies is a connecting  axis mundi , presumably     derived from the vertical path of shamanic commuting to Heaven     and Hell. The eminent Australian anthropologist A.P. Elkin himself     observed and bravely reported acts of levitation, magical healing     and other paranormal feats performed by Aboriginal shamans or     'men of high degree' [Elkin 1946]. Reference was also made to     the Aboriginal 'songlines', age-old ritual routes -- sometimes     transcontinental -- which structured the landscape with a kind     of liturgical geography or musical map, crossing tribal and linguistic     frontiers with a continuously recognisable chant which functioned     like a passport.[ 5 ]     Although a long way from cosmic harmonics, the Australian songlines     could plausibly be viewed as an early use of 'music' in structuring,     mapping and interpreting the visible world.        While such apparently remote analogies with Greek ideas eluded     the white invaders of Australia -- and are resented by some anthropologists     even today [ 6 ]     -- the following report is highly suggestive:                ...Another version of the origin of the Milky Way, current       in Queensland, identifies it with the deeds of  Priepriggie ,       an Orpheus-like hero, as famed for his songs and dances as for       his hunting. When he sang, the people danced to the rhythm until       they dropped with exhaustion, and declared that if  Priepriggie        wished he could make even the stars dance. One morning when he       speared a flying fox, its companions descended upon him in vengeance,       carrying him up to the sky. Unable to find him, his people decided       to perform his dance, hoping for his return, but without him       they could not capture the rhythm. Suddenly they heard a sound       of singing in the sky. As the rhythm grew louder and more pronounced,       the stars, hitherto randomly dispersed, began to dance and arrange       themselves in time to  Priepriggie 's song. Thus the Milky       Way serves as a reminder that the tribal hero should be celebrated       with traditional songs and dancing' [Haynes et al. 1996, 13-14].[ 7 ]              Given the ancient association of choreography and cosmology,[ 8 ] this beautiful     Australian legend seems only a short step from the world of Pythagoras.     In his  World History of the Dance  [1937] Curt Sachs showed     how the astral dance, imitating the circular procession of the     stars, is found in all the inhabited continents. Its origins     too are lost in prehistory; but the circle is probably the oldest     rational form known to and employed by humanity (and it is even     danced by other primates). So, if mimetic dance was the original     connecting principle between the upper and lower worlds, then     the 'analogy of the macrocosm and microcosm' might have had very     remote precedents in an age long before the invention of writing,     perhaps even before speech itself.        Philosophers have rarely contemplated the beginnings of their     subject in Australian prehistory; but Robert Lawlor has concluded     that indigenous Australians had something like the Pythagorean     table of opposites and the Hippocratic fourfold classification     of phenomena into Dry/Hot, Hot/Moist, Dry/Cool and Cool/Moist     [Lawlor 1991, 321ff. Cf. 31-2]. Similarly, there is evidence     suggesting that the 'analogy of the macrocosm and the microcosm'     -- perhaps the world's oldest cosmic system -- goes back to the     myth and ritual of Australian and other paleolithic cultures,     antedating the civilisations of Mesopotamia, Egypt and Greece     by thousands -- perhaps tens of thousands -- of years. Europeans     have always regarded Australia as being a long way from the centre     of things, but during the last twenty or thirty years the discoveries     of Australian archaeology and prehistory are starting to reverse     that perspective.        Thus we arrived at a tentative answer to our first grand question:     the 'analogy of the macrocosm and the microcosm' was the classical     Greek formulation of a world-view that was prehistoric in origin.     The late classical image of Urania dancing in the chorus of the     Muses surely recalls the archaic astral dance which finally became     the annual liturgy or song and dance of the Church, while achieving     concrete form in the ziggurats of Mesopotamia and the pyramids     of Egypt.        THE HARMONY OF THE SPHERES       T he mathematisation of this     primitive world-view obviously came much later, probably after     the 'neolithic revolution' and the emergence of the first villages     and towns was made possible by herding and agriculture. It was     sometime during the era of  civilisation  -- the culture     of cities -- that the old mimetic relationship between the larger     universal system and the local human order was transformed into     a precise mathematical  analogy ; that is, the heavenly     order came to be seen as a harmony or attunement controlled by     number and the earthly order was accordingly formed on, adjusted     to, or interpreted in accordance with the same number system,     which was duodecimal, not decimal. This, the oldest known mathematical     cosmology, may have been suggested by the use of simple numbers     in choreography, primarily the first few integers which are still     used to measure rhythm today (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12). Thus     the 'analogy of the macrocosm and microcosm' became the 'harmony     of the spheres' when the earthly imitation of the heavenly dance     was finally reinterpreted as a system of harmonic proportions     shared by macrocosm and microcosm (both of which were still conceived     as vital organisms).        The bold and ingenious hypothesis that the world was a harmony,     a cosmos ordered on the proportions of the musical scale,[ 9 ] must have     been invented by someone -- a very sophisticated thinker, indeed;     but the identity and whereabouts of that Asiatic Pythagoras are     also lost in time. The evidence points first to Babylon and then,     second, to Egypt [ 10 ]     -- to the very countries where the historical Pythagoras is said     to have studied and where, presumably, he acquired the science     of the monochord.        It     has long been understood that the monochord, or  kanon ,     played a central role in the philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato,     but the early history of the instrument and its use in scientific     theory and philosophical speculation are very poorly documented.     Pythagoras, on his death-bed, is said to have recommended the     study of the monochord to his disciples; and Plato in effect     did the same -- if he really was responsible for the argument     of the  Epinomis , a kind of appendix or key to his last     dialogue, the  Laws  (the imperfect text is thought to have     been penned by his secretary, Philippus of Opus). The  Epinomis      is the only writing in the entire Platonic corpus that specifically     alludes to the harmonic  analogia  or tuning module of 6:8::9:12     [ Epinomis  991a-b], but at this very point, unfortunately,     the text is obscure or corrupt!        MONOCHORD MATHEMATICS A nalogia  means 'equality of     ratios' or 'proportion' but  the analogia  is the module     or system of whole-number ratios that gives the 'divisions of     the monochord', the precise points at which the vibrating string     can be stopped, with a movable bridge, to sound the 'fixed' or     fundamental intervals of the musical scale, the octave (2:1);     the fifth (3:2); the fourth (3:4); and the major tone (8:9).     The integers 6, 8, 9 and 12 are the smallest whole numbers with     which the symmetrical system of interlocking ratios -- the natural     framework of the ancient and modern diatonic scales -- can be     expressed. Just as the Greeks admitted that their lyre was a     foreign invention (brought to their land by the winged messenger     Mercury or, some say, by Pythagoras), so they knew that the tuning     system of Mercury's lyre, 6:8::9:12, was also imported -- presumably     from Babylon, where the precise relationship between pitch, string     -- length and numerical proportion could have been discovered     a thousand or even two thousand years before Pythagoras (indeed     almost any time during the first three or four millennia of the     harp's development).        The oldest surviving book on the monochord and its divisions     was written by Euclid (c.300 BC) but the instrument itself was     obviously much older. Its early use and significance have been     greatly illuminated by Ernest G. McClain, first with  The Myth     of Invariance  [1976] and then with  The Pythagorean Plato      [1978]. Neither a classical scholar nor a mathematician, in the     ordinary sense, McClain was a professor of the clarinet at Brooklyn     College, New York. Endowed with a rare combination of musical     and philosophical intelligence -- and a virtuoso's grasp of tuning     theory and practice -- he went in search of the ancient wisdom,     inspired by like-minded colleagues including Ernst Levy and Antonio     T. de Nicolas. Developing insights of Robert S. Brumbaugh as     well, McClain made an 'intellectual breakthrough of the utmost     significance' by offering a simple musical explanation of 'crucial     passages in texts of world literature -- the Rg Veda, the Egyptian     Book of the Dead, the Bible, Plato -- that have defied critics     of the separate concerned disciplines' [Levarie 1976, xi ff.].     McClain's method was not new in principle but his development     and application of it has produced amazing results.        Taking the numbers used in or derived from monochord tuning,     McClain identified their widespread employment in numerical allegories,     myths, and metaphors found in some of the oldest books in the     world. For example, when Plato characterised the good man as     'living 729 times more pleasantly, and the tyrant more painfully     by this same interval' ( Republic  587e), he used the number     which defines the tritone (the sixth power of three; that is,     6/5 above the fundamental tone). Thus the tension between the     good man and the tyrant is compared to the worst possible dissonance     in the western musical system (Plato's model here, incidentally,     is both musical and geometrical). Similarly, McClain decoded     many other musical allegories and discovered the meaning of some     incredibly large numbers in Babylonian, Egyptian, Hindu, Greek,     and Hebrew texts. In  The Pythagorean Plato , he applied     the same method to Plato's numerology and produced a simple,     consistent and comprehensive explanation of allegorical texts     that had defeated five hundred years of classical scholarship.        Though in fact a corollary to his first book,  The Pythagorean     Plato  [1978] is much more approachable for the general reader.     The introduction explains the basics of tuning theory and the     graphic use of the monochord string turned into a tonal circle     on which any scale can be represented geometrically. Seven of     Plato's numerical allegories are then analysed in detail showing,     for example, how his political theory was modeled on musical     theory, with the constitutions of Callipolis, Athens, Atlantis     and Magnesia corresponding to four different 'temperaments' or     tuning systems (including the equally tempered scale, long considered     to be a modern invention).        The key to Plato's musico-political analogies is here revealed     for the first time, and they were by no means an idiosyncratic     jest: the Greek word  syntagma  can refer to either a political     or a musical system, just as the Sanskrit  grama  can denote     a village or a scale [Rudhyar 1982, 14]. In  Classical and     Christian Ideas of World Harmony , written during the 1940s,     Leo Spitzer set out to explain the compound meanings of the German     Stimmung and discovered its relations with a whole gamut of harmonic     terms resonating through the European languages [Spitzer 1963].     On purely philological grounds, Spitzer divided these terms into     two groups: first, those related to 'chord' -- 'concord', 'accord',     etc. -- and, second, those related to 'temperance' -- 'tempo',     'temperament', etc. The two groups correspond fairly well to     the distinction between  tuning  by whole numbers and  tempering      by small adjustments (involving irrational proportions).        Spitzer was puzzled by the root-meaning of the second group,     'a section cut off' [Spitzer 1963, 82].[ 11 ] Of uncertain origin, the variety of     the 'tem-' words and their wide distribution throughout the Indo-European     languages testify to the existence of a very ancient harmonic     world-view or musical cosmology: words like  temenos  (sacred     place), 'temple', 'time', 'template', and 'terminus' all refer     to divisions of space and time based, presumably, on a common     mathematics --  which must have been musical in origin .     Thus comparative philology might yet enable the reconstruction     of a 'Pythagorean' cosmology and harmonic technology much older     than Pythagoras himself.        The close association of the musical and spatial sciences     was independently confirmed by Árpád Szabó     in  The Beginnings of Greek Mathematics  [Szabó 1978,     99ff.], which argues that all the extant terms of pre-Euclidean     Greek geometry were derived from music theory or harmonics. For     example, 'diastema' means an interval, spatial or musical, just     as 'chord' still has a geometrical as well as a musical meaning.     The geometrical representation of an interval as a line terminated     by vertical strokes could equally be a picture of the monochord     string.        TEMPLE HARMONIES      ' T he Predecessors of Pythagoras'     now lead us into a brief survey of temple art and architecture     and their connections with the science of music. Temples have     always been the grandest monuments that man has built in imitation     of the heavenly order. Reviewing a continuous tradition of five     millennia, Joseph Campbell showed how the form of the temple     has remained faithful to the old mandala of circle and square,     symbols of Heaven and Earth. The Egyptian hieroglyph for a town     is a circle enclosing a St Andrew's cross, with its arms pointing     to the minor directions -- a perfect representation of the consecrated     enclosure that was subdivided to make the four quarters of the     town. Campbell pointed out that the with the rise of the hieratic     city-state (c.3500-2500 BC):                …The whole city now (not simply the temple area) is conceived       as an imitation on earth of the celestial order -- a sociological       middle cosmos, or mesocosm, between the macrocosm of the universe       and the microcosm of the individual, making visible their essential       form: with the king in the center (either as sun or as mooon,       according to the local cult) and an organization of the walled       city, in the manner of a mandala, about the central sanctum of       the palace and the ziggurat; and with a mathematically structured       calendar, furthermore, to regulate the seasons of the city's       life according to the passages of the sun and moon among the       stars; as well as a highly developed system of ritual arts, including       an art of rendering audible to human ears the harmony of the       visible celestial spheres. It is at this moment that the art       of writing first appears in the world...[ Campbell 1990,  151-2 ].              Campbell rightly emphasised that the same sexagesimal number     system was used to represent the 'mandala of space' (the circle     of 360°) and the 'mandala of time' (the almost congruent     circle of the year); and he has also shown how the same sacred     'mesocosm' gradually extended from the Nile to Central America.     The structure and symbolism of the Egyptian temples have been     analysed by John Michell, who argues that they incorporate cosmic     measures [Michell 1988], and by R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz, who     concluded that the great monument at Luxor actually represents     the growth of the human microcosm in extraordinary physiological     detail [Schwaller de Lubicz 1977].        None of these authors, however, succeeds in elucidating the     persistent tradition that 'architecture is frozen music' -- that     the canons used in temple design were originally harmonic. The     Renaissance enthusiasm for harmonic proportions in design has     not yet been matched by a convincing history of ancient architecture     as 'applied music'. But how else are we to explain Vitruvius's     frequent      references to music, including his comments on the different     Greek tuning systems [Vitruvius 1999, V, 4]? Lacking more specific     texts, we are necessarily restricted to direct measurement of     existing edifices, as in Hans Kayser's suggestive analysis of     the temples at Paestum [Kayser 1958], Donald Preziosi's work     on the ground-plans of Minoan architecture [Preziosi 1983] and     various more recent studies, including Anne Bulckens's persuasive     analysis of the Parthenon and the symbolism of its harmonic proportions     [Bulckens 1999].        The mathematics of temple design fall outside the mainstream     of Pythagorean studies but is directly relevant to the harmony     of the spheres. If the ancient priests, sages and philosophers     were able to discern musical proportions in the heavenly system,     would they not have naturally encoded them in their earthly imitations     -- just as their predecessors imitated the dance of the stars?     A discordance between the macrocosm and the microcosm seems unthinkable     but there is as yet no consensus on the ancient use of musical     proportions in sacred architecture.        Of particular importance in this regard is the work of the     late Abraham Seidenberg. His series of ground-breaking articles     in the  Archive for History of Exact Sciences  (1962-1981)     argued that the origins of arithmetic and geometry are to be     found in the ritual arts: for example, the oldest precise descriptions     of geometrical procedures are found in the  sulvasutras ,     ancient Indian works on altar construction, a liturgical tradition     that goes back to the  Rg Veda  (c.1500 B.C.) and probably     much earlier. Seidenberg's work evoked little response from fellow     mathematicians until it received the  imprimatur  of no     other than B.L. van der Waerden [Van der Waerden 1983, 10ff.].     Though Seidenberg failed to grasp fully the ancient conception     of practical music -- which embraced not only ritual but also     song, dance, drama, poetry, eloquence, gesture and deportment     -- his findings throw new light on the archaic association of     music and the exact arts and sciences, while lending additional     support to the hypothesis that the harmony of the spheres was     long anticipated in the measured dance of Urania and her sister     Muses.        The relationship of dance geometry and the mathematical arts     is a living reality in India: in  The Square and the Circle     of the Indian Arts  [1983], dance authority Kapila Vatsyayan     explored the connections between sacred dance, geometric mandalas,     and temple architecture, illustrating her argument with photographs     of ritual dances, some possibly as old as the  Rg Veda .     All of this confirms Lewis Mumford's great historical insight:     his vision of the crucial role in human evolution of 'biotechnics',     the arts of brain and body that preceded and made possible the     mastery of tools [Mumford 1967, 6ff., 60ff]. Mumford argued that     these biotechnics were a critical, though largely overlooked,     factor in the prehistoric development of tool technology and     the constructive arts. For the early Greeks, and all other preliterate     cultures, the most important 'biotechnics' were the musical arts     (the arts of the Muses); and this fact alone might be sufficient     to explain the extraordinary value placed on musical numbers     in the ancient arts and sciences. So, if architecture was indeed     'frozen music' -- the art of building regulated by cosmic measures     and musical canons -- then one would expect to find the harmony     of the spheres reflected in the temples of that era. Accordingly,     John Michell has found cosmic numbers in the dimensions of the     pyramids but they do not seem to match McClain's musical numbers!     The secrets of the old temple builders remain a fascinating puzzle.        These grander issues, of course, are hardly ever addressed     in ordinary musical theory, ancient or modern. The early treatises     on Greek music are full of the forbidding technicalities of scales     and tuning; and the modern literature is likewise replete with     agonising discussions of textual problems and terminological     difficulties which intimidate the general reader, repel the practical     musician, and frustrate even the most determined scholar. In     pursuing the predecessors of Pythagoras we avoided those complications     by looking at the Greeks  from the other end , so to speak:     by viewing them, not as the founding fathers of western art and     science but as the heirs of their predecessors in the older civilisations.     This longer and larger perspective throws the Greek achievements     into sharper focus -- however hazy the details might be. Looking     to the West we can immediately discern the distant figure of     Pythagoras -- or is it a chorus of Pythagoreans? -- standing     at the gateway through which eastern ideas and inventions passed     into Europe.        The long shadow of the Master has unjustly obscured other     pioneers of Greek musical thought, such as Lasus of Hermione     (late sixth century B.C.), who is traditionally credited with     writing the first book  On Music ; a fragment preserves     the earliest known musical use of the term 'harmonia'. [Comotti     1989, 25ff.] And, well before Pythagoras, there was another legendary     citharode, Terpander, who established an influential school of     music at Sparta early in the seventh century. In his final essay,     "" Pythagoras, Egypt, Sparta"",     the  Dux  of the 1997 class, C had Bochan, identified     the Spartans as the immediate predecessors of Pythagoras [ 12 ]: the     Spartans were geographically the closest of the mainland Greeks     to the Egyptians and perhaps the first to imitate their musical     system.        This reversing of the temporal perspective also reveals that,     for all the effort expended by the Greeks on rhythm and tuning     theory, very little of their musical system could have been entirely     original.[ 13 ]     Scholars have long suspected that the diatonic scale had been     imported from Asia and superimposed on the native tetrachordal     system (another innovation ascribed to Pythagoras) but there     was little hard evidence to go on. After centuries of literary     exegesis and scholarly debate, new illumination was suddenly     obtained from two highly important archeological discoveries.        ARCHAEOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY OF HARMONICS       T he first was the unearthing     and decoding of the world's earliest known tuning manual, preserved     in cuneiform writing on an Old-Babylonian (Akkadian) clay tablet     from Ur, dating from the early to middle second millennium B.C.     Reading this in the light of other tablets with mathematical     and musical texts, an interdisciplinary group of scholars made     a conjectural interpretation of the tuning instructions, which     they demonstrated on a reproduction lyre (modeled on a genuine     instrument of a later period). Assuming that the strings were     meant to be tuned in a diatonic system, they found that the instructions     made musical sense and yielded 'specific intervals of the diatonic     scale familiar to us as traditional western intervals' [Kilmer,     et al. 1976]. Their brilliant demonstration of 'Sounds from Silence'     is not, of course, a conclusive proof, but it is a profoundly     moving experience to hear our ordinary major scale among those     performed on the disc recording. If these scholars are right     in surmising that the Babylonians knew the modern diatonic system,     then the contribution of the Greeks to tuning theory might have     been little more than lexicographical![ 14 ] This important discovery serves     only to reinforce the tradition that it was the Babylonian priests     who invented the harmony of the spheres.        The second discovery is the most important ever made in the     archeology of music. In 1977, 124 musical instruments were found     among some 7,000 burial objects in the tomb of the obscure Marquis     Yi, who was buried c. 433 in Zeng, now Hubei Province, west of     Nanjing, in the People's Republic of China. The instruments included     65 bronze bells, forming a well-tuned carillon of five octaves,     still in playing order. To everybody's astonishment, the bells     produced a very accurate, mostly chromatic scale. Cast by a technique     unknown to the West, each bell can sound two clear and distinct     musical notes which are much purer than those of western bells,     and the sound is obtained from a resonator that is a hundred     times lighter than its western equivalent! Each bell is inscribed     with instructions in gold, explaining the name and function of     each note in the scale: a musical Rosetta Stone, no less.        Among those who were most surprised by this find were the     Chinese themselves, who were totally unprepared for the discovery     of the chromatic scale in their early history, and very slow     to make the bells accessible to the wider scholarly world. Almost     all memory of a Chinese chromatic scale had been lost, possibly     through the burning of musical books and instruments by the Emperor     Qin Shiuangdi (She Huang-Ti) who reigned from 221-210 B.C. [McClain     1985, 165]. On one of the first compact disc recordings, the     bells perform 'Unique Music of Great Antiquity', which is arbitrarily     restricted to the traditional pentatonic scale (China Record     Corporation, CCD-89/26, 1989). But the bells are capable of performing     tunes in the full diatonic scale, as is shown by later recordings     which feature arrangements of western classical music. How long     the chromatic scale had been known in ancient China is anybody's     guess, but the existence of Marquis Yi's carillon now suggests     that there may have been some truth in the legend of the twelve     bamboo  lü s (pitch-pipes sounding a twelve-note division     of the octave) traditionally ascribed to the mythical 'Yellow     Emperor' Huang Di. An elaborate description and analysis of these     bells is to be found in Chén Cheng Yih (c.1994).        In a preliminary assessment of Marquis Yi's carillon, Ernest     McClain pointed out that 'contemporary fifth century classical     Greece, which we are in the habit of venerating, left no artifacts     of comparable musical value' [McClain 1985,  171 ].     The bells confirm that 'the prevailing diatonic pattern in China     as well as India, Greece, and Babylon is that of the C major     scale or its inverse (Greek Dorian)', as argued by McClain in     his book published the year before the discovery of these bells     [McClain 1976]. Thus the bells point to a 'tonal cosmology' which     anticipates that of Plato and was possibly inherited from Babylon;     but, as McClain wisely counsels, the whole subject needs to be     re-examined by an 'anthropology educated in the harmonical sciences     of the ancient world', before any firm conclusions can be drawn     on the early history of tuning theory and the dissemination of     harmonic cosmology. Nonetheless, these astounding discoveries     have already transformed our understanding of the ancient musical     world and our appreciation of its vital continuity with, and     enduring contribution to, the arts and sciences of modern civilisation.[ 15 ]        The writings of the classical Greeks and their Roman and Arabic     successors remain the foundation of western philosophy and science     of music, as well as their sometimes problematic applications     to architecture and other constructive arts. Much of the Greek     theory and practice of harmonics was unquestionably derived from     earlier cultures, the still shadowy predecessors of Pythagoras.     But, as we come to understand more about the achievements of     those predecessors, the actual Greek contribution to musical     philosophy and science will seem even more characteristically     Hellenic: for here, as in most of the arts and sciences they     cultivated, the Greeks created a rational theory, invented a     systematic vocabulary, ordered the subject with a logical classification     and infused the whole with a spirit of inquiry that still inspires     us today.        NOTES        [ 1]     An erudite and forthright critic of the Greeks was William Chappell     (1809-1888): ""There is no longer room to doubt that the     entire Greek system was mainly derived from Egypt, Phoenicia,     Babylon, or other countries of more ancient civilization than     Greece"" [Chappell 1874, 1].  return     to text            [ 2] [Cornford     1952, 107ff]. Europe's last distinguished representative of this     ancient tradition was probably St Francis of Assisi, whose fits     of ecstasy and sermon to the birds (c.1220) are unmistakably     shamanic. So are Socrates' 'daemon' (or 'inner voice') and his     trances.  return to text        [ 3]     From Abaris, his 'Hyperborean' ( British?) d isciple, Pythagoras     obtained a golden arrow that, like the witch's broom, enabled     him to fly and appear the same day in two towns separated by     'a journey of many days'. See Guthrie 1987, 90-91, 128.  return to text        [ 4]     The story of Pythagoras meditating 'the greater part of day and     night' in a cave outside the city of Samos [Guthrie 1987, 62]     recalls another familiar practice of the shamans.  return     to text        [ 5]     Cf. Lawlor 1991, 48. It should be kept in mind that Chatwin's     influential book, though based on personal experience of Aboriginal     Australia , is a work of literary rather than strictly scientific     anthropology.  return to text        [ 6]     Some years ago I applied for a major research grant to conduct     a comparative and historical study of the Aboriginal Corroboree     as the 'indigenous Australian opera'. The application was referred     to the two most eminent female anthropologists in the country,     one of whom gave the project a top rating for its originality     and national significance; the other (who happened to have been     trained by the same philosophers who taught me) utterly damned     the whole idea, especially with the revelation that I had never     attended a corroboree (except, that is, of the imported kind).      return to text        [ 7]     They also report a perfect example of 'As above so below': 'Central     Australian tribes believed that the Milky Way divided the sky     people into two tribes and hence served as a perpetual reminder     that a similar division of lands should be observed by local     neighbouring tribes' ( loc. cit .).  return     to text        [ 8]     See [Miller 1986], especially Foreword and Chapter 1. Cf. [Doczi     1994, Chapter 4].  return to text        [ 9]     For a concise summary of the Pythagorean doctrine and the ancient     literary evidence, see [Michaelides 1978,129-30].  return     to text        [ 10]     Gadalla 2002, 22-3 claims the harmony of the spheres (that is,     the 'planetary scale',the melodious movement of the classical     'planets', from Earth to Saturn, and including the Sun and Moon,     in the proportions of a diatonic scale) as a purely Egpytian     discovery. Fabre d'Olivet had long ago reached a similar conclusion.     See Godwin 1993, 347ff.  return to     text        [ 11]     I once speculated that the root meaning of 'section cut off'     referred to the  sectio   canonis  or division of the     monochord but this hypothesis over-simplifies what must have     been a very protracted history of human invention and social     development. Following Abraham Seidenberg, I now think it more     likely that the 'tem-' words originally referred to ritual or     liturgical procedures of 'cutting off' or delineating sections     of space and time as, for example, in the timing of festivals     or the reservation of sacred enclosures. Much later the 'tem-'     vocabulary was extended to musical theory, as in the terms 'temper'     and 'temperament'.  return to text        [ 12]     'In the seventh century… Sparta was the most important musical     center of Greece' (Comotti 1989, 17).  return     to text        [ 13]     The classical Greek music theorists concentrated their efforts     on the measurement of melody and rhythm and the development of     a fairly precise notation for both (see [Comotti 1989, 110-20]).     Their greatest achievement (the significance of which has often     been overlooked) was probably the quantitative analysis of the     various tribal or regional 'modes' and the codification of their     distinctive rhythms and accents. While the Greeks relied heavily     on their predecessors in speculative music and tuning systems,     their empirical and mathematical studies of contemporary song     and dance were the beginning of comparative musicology in the     West.  return to text        [ 14]     John Curtis Franklin has recently thrown new light on the influence     of 'Mesopotamian diatony' on Greek music during the 'orientalising     period' (c.750-650 BC). See [Franklin 2002a, 2002b].  return     to text        [ 15]     Even so, one might wonder how long it will take the recent progress     in harmonic studies to affect the structure and content of academic     courses in music, architecture, mathematics, aesthetics, cultural     history, etc.  return to text        REFERENCES       Anderson, Warren D. 1994.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR Graham Pont , a specialist in interdisciplinary studies, taught     in the General Education programme at the University of New South     Wales for thirty years. Here he introduced the world's first     undergraduate courses in Gastronomy (1978-88). He was a founding     convener of the Symposium of Australian Gastronomy (1984) and     co-editor of  Landmarks of Australian Gastronomy  (1988).     His last appointments were a visiting professorship in the School     of Science and Technology Studies, UNSW (1996-99) and a visiting     fellowship to Clare Hall, Cambridge (1997-8).      Trained in philosophy, his principal research area has been history     and philosophy of music but his interests have also extended     to environmental studies, landscape, history of gardening, philosophy     of technology, bio-acoustics and wine history. In 2000 he published     the results of the first major computer analysis of Handel's     music and he is completing a biography of Australia's first composer     and musicologist, Isaac Nathan (1792-1864).

Jefferson adapted Locke concept of an inherent ontractbetween the rulers and the ruled, explaining how rulers only rule through the consent of the governed. This means that they enjoy the ightto change the terms of this contract. He used this idea of a contract to justify the revolt against King George III and the formation of an independent confederation of former colonies that became the United States. He further elaborated that slavery was either a violation of atural rights,possible only through the consent of the enslaved, or through a continuous state of arbetween ruler and ruled.[1] Jefferson does not refer to slavery explicitly but his acquisition and adaptation of another concept of Locke demonstrates that slavery must have been on his mind. Perhaps the most famous phrase of all in this Declaration is that ll men are created equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable Rights; that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.2] This phrase reflects the ideas within Locke  . . .         Jefferson must have been hoping that those who would read, or have read to them, this Declaration would not be aware of the writings of Locke or the problems that Locke formulations of atural property rightswould have caused in a society in which ropertyincluded human beings, and also in which those that owned the land were not necessarily those that worked the land.   Jefferson use of Locke words reflect the Enlightenment thinking that many historians ascribe to the ounding Fathersof this country.  Second Treatise of Government that there are certain atural rightsthat all people possess.  He asks how it is possible for a slave to celebrate the 4th of July, a day on which all men are created equal when the reality of their daily existence made a lie of this assertion.  His leisure time to read such things as Locke resulted from the work of his slaves.  King drew on these shared symbols for the same purpose as did Douglass and Mott, to challenge Americans to look at their society and recognize its flaws. 4] >From this beginning, which draws upon Jefferson words which were perhaps better known to the common people than were Locke words when Jefferson used them, Mott proceeds to argue forcefully for the equality of women and to decry the injustices to which women in US society were subject. 7] John Locke originated ideas of atural rightswhich were adopted and adapted by Thomas Jefferson.

""Play needs to be cherished and encouraged, for in their free play children reveal their future minds."" ~ Friedrich Froebel (1887)      "" To be or not to be: That is the question. "" (Shakespeare,  Hamlet)     This powerful quote poses the question as to whether Hamlet should continue living or not. ""To exist or not to exist, that's the question for me"" paraphrases his dilemma. This is a profound question asked at a time of peril. The essence of the question defines the focus of ""To Play or Not To Play: Is It Really a Question?"" During a time in our education system when play is being assaulted from many fronts, we, too, find a climate of peril; play is in danger. Play, once commonplace in classrooms, is now found only outside the classroom. Now, we are finding play removed from outside the classroom by the elimination of recess. Where is the place for play? Where will it exist, so our children can flourish? The resounding call for play's existence issues from courageous people willing to demand that play live, that play exist. To live or not to live? To exist or not to exist? To be or not to be? To play or not to play? Are these really valid questions when the stakes are so high, the alternative so bleak? This book takes the necessary step in affirming play's vital role in child development and provides a voice for play. To play or not to play? No, it should not be in question!

The quests for African liberation, the civil rights movements, and the black power and black arts movements had created an  ambience  in which activist members of the faculties at colleges and universities and black students who had come of age during the late 1960s sought to foster revolutionary changes in the traditional curricula. In search of relevanceto use a word that became a clich during that periodthe students wanted a curriculum that forth-rightly addressed their particular history and the social problems that adversely affected the lives of the vast majority of African Americans, not only at predominantly white colleges and universities but also the masses in African American communities as well. Consequently, all-black organizations sprang up on most major campuses around the nation and demanded courses in black history and culture. In so doing, black students shunned traditional European and European American courses in hopes of not only establishing blacks' contributions to history and society but also of engendering robustly ecumenical perspectives in the curricula. The first African American Studies units were founded as a response to student protests at San Francisco State College (now University), Merritt College in Oakland, California, and Cornell University. With the support of the Black Student Union, and many students from other racial groups, Nathan Hare, a  sociologist  who had written an expos of the black middle class while teaching at predominantly black Howard University, compelled San Francisco State's administration in 1968 to create the first African American Studies department in the United States. One year later, James E. Turner, a doctoral student, was appointed the head of the African Studies and Research Center unit at Cornell University, after widely publicized pictures of gun-toting black students were circulated by the mass media. Although there were no strictly operational definitions of what constituted the field of African American Studies in the early years, most of its practitioners concurred in the opinion that it was the study of African peoples and their brethren the world overwith emphases on history, cultures, and social problems. The purpose of the field was not only to  ameliorate  the conditions under which black people lived but also to enhance their self-image and self-esteem, and build their character. Despite the  idealistic  goals of the founders, the economic crisis that lasted from the mid-1970s until the early 1980s wreaked  havoc  with the budgets of most institutions of higher learning. As a result, African American Studies came under the  scrutiny  and criticism of both the administrations at those institutions attempting to trim their budgets and the prominent black academics who were critical of what they perceived as the units'  lax  academic standards,  unqualified  faculties, and poor leader-ship. Although administrators slashed the budgets of many fields in the humanities, African American Studies units were especially vulnerableprimarily because they were still in a  fledgling  stage. Martin Kilson, a distinguished political scientist at Harvard University who refused to join his institution's unit, and the Duke University scholar of English, Kenny Williams, raised serious questions about the intellectual integrity and validity of African American Studies. Critical of the  instability  and the hyper-politicization of African American Studies in the 1970s, the aforementioned scholars compelled a  reassessment  and fostered a reconceptualization of its curriculum and position in the academy. As a result, in the 1980s, such leading black academics as Ron Karenga, the author of a popular textbook entitled  Introduction to Black Studies  (1982), sought to provide a theoretical base for African American Studies with his concept of Kawaida, which provided an holistic cultural nationalist approach to black history, religion, social organization, politics, economics, psychology, and the creative arts. During this same period,  Molefi Kete Asante  was appointed the head of African American Studies at Temple University. That institution nurtured the department, and in 1988, it became the first institution in the country to award the doctorate in the comparatively new field. Asante 's theoretical conceptualizations were significant, for he attempted to center his work and that of his students and colleagues on the examination of African and African American culture, which he labeled "" Afrocentrism ."" This brand of cultural nationalism deconstructs ""Eurocentrism"" and seeks to  reclaim  his peoples' ""pre-American heritage."" In recent years, Asante and other Afrocentrists have been criticized for presenting a static view of history and culture, and thereby ignoring the dynamic interaction between blacks and European and European American cultural, economic, and political structures. Despite the  futility  of his attempt to conceptualize the field, Asante, like Karenga, made a heroic effort to set up some parameters for the focus of African American Studies. The goal of standardization and definition of African American Studies has become increasingly difficultespecially with the emergence of other notable scholars in the field who have an ideological orientation that differs from those of the founders.  Manning Marable , the political scientist, historian, journalist, and director of the Institute for African American Studies at Columbia University, for example, purveys the social democratic ideology; the sociologist Abdul Alkalimat and his heroesLangston Hughes, Paul Robeson, W. E. B. Du Boiswere socialists. In short, as the 1980s came to a close there was no single theoretical orientation in the curriculum of African American Studies that most scholars concurred in. As the twentieth century came to a close, the most vocal and visible African American Studies unit emerged at Harvard University, under the direction of literary critic and historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. The program, which at one time included the noted philosopher,  orator , and theologian, Cornell West; the philosopher, Anthony Appiah; and the distinguished sociologist, William Julius Wilson, was what Arthur Lewin, an associate professor of Black and Hispanic Studies at  Baruch College , call ""inclusionist."" In other words, Gates and his colleagues sought to foster a great appreciation and tolerance of African Americans by the American public by dispassionately informing them of black peoples' history and culture.  Africana: The Encyclopedia African and African American Studies  (1999) is just one example of their endeavors. African American Studies units have been in existence for over thirty years. Nonetheless, they continue to maintain varying identities, which militates against the development of the status of the discipline.

The field challenges the sociohistorical and cultural content and definition of western ideology. African-American studies argues for a  multicultural  interpretation of the Western Hemisphere rather than a Eurocentric one. It has its earliest roots in history, sociology, literature, and the arts. The field's most important concepts, methods, and findings to date are situated within these disciplines. More than one hundred and fifty years after the signing of the  Emancipation Proclamation , African Americans still struggle for a space in academia for a legitimate voice to express their interpretations and perspectives of their historical and contemporary experiences in Africa, the diaspora, and North America. Those in African-American studies argue not only that their voices have been marginalized, but that the history of African Americans' experiences and contributions to the United States has historically and systematically been missing from the texts and the curricula. Thus, African-American studies functions as a  supplementary  academic component for the sole purpose of adding the African experience to traditional disciplines. Implicit to African-American studies is the notion that the black diasporic experience has been ignored or has not been accurately portrayed in academia or popular culture. From the earliest period of the field to the present, this movement has had two main objective: first, to  counteract  the effects of white racism in the area of group elevation; and second, to generate a stronger sense of black identity and community as a way of  multiplying  the group's  leverage  in the liberation struggle. The Foundations of African-American Studies The Atlanta University Conferences held from 1898 to 1914, under the  auspices  of W. E. B. DuBois, marked the inauguration of the first scientific study of the conditions of black people that covered important aspects of life (e.g., health, homes, the question of organization, economic development, higher education, common schools, artisans, the church, crime, and  suffrage ). It was during this period that African-American studies was formally introduced to the university and black academics initiated re-search studies. One of the important goals of the scholars of this period was to counteract the negative images and representations of blacks that were  institutionalized  within academia and society. This was in response to the major  tenet  of social science research at this time that argued blacks were genetically inferior to whites and that Africa was a ""dark continent"" that lacked civilization. The American Negro Academy, founded in 1896, set as one of its major goals to assist, by publications, the vindication of the race from vicious assaults in all areas of learning and truth. In 1899 DuBois published a sociological study,  The Philadelphia Negro.  This landmark study highlighted the conditions of blacks in Philadelphia in the Seventh Ward. The study investigated the black experience as reflected in business, public education, religion, voluntary associations, and public health. In 1915 the founding of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH) by Carter G.  Woodson  marked the beginning of a new era in African-American studies. The ASNLH was founded to promote historical research; publish books on black life and history; promote the study of blacks through clubs and schools; and bring harmony between the races by interpreting the one to the other. In 1916, Woodson founded the  Journal of Negro History  and served as its editor until his death. This was perhaps one of Woodson's greatest contributions to the area of African-American studies. In 1926 Woodson and his colleagues launched Negro History Week. This event, which later evolved into a whole month, was not intended to be the only time of the year in which Negro history was to be celebrated and taught. Woodson and his colleagues viewed this as a time to highlight the ongoing study of black history that was to take place throughout the year. It was during this time that historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) began to respond to the scholarly activities in history and social science. It was becoming clear that black education should conform to the social conditions of black people. Black colleges began to add courses in black history to their curricula; this corresponded with the call by black college students for a culturally relevant curriculum, a theme that reoccurred later with greater political influence. In 1919, prior to the influx of HBCUs offering black history courses as a part of their curriculum, Woodson issued the first report on African-American studies courses offered in Northern colleges. He reported the following courses: Ohio State University,  Slavery Struggles in the United States Nebraska University,  The Negro Problem Under Slavery and Freedom Stanford University,  Immigration and the Race Problem University of Oklahoma,  Modern Race Problems University of Missouri,  The Negro in America University of Chicago,  The Negro in America University of Minnesota,  The American Negro Harvard University,  American Population Problems: Immigration and the Negro Furthermore, Woodson reported that a small number of HBCUs were offering courses in sociology and history pertaining to the Negro experience. Wood-son stated that in spite of the lack of trained teachers, Tuskeegee, Atlanta University, Fisk, Wilberforce, and Howard offered such courses, even at the risk of their becoming expressions of opinions without the necessary data to support them. The period from approximately 1940 to the mid to late 1960s marked yet another era of African-American studies in history and the social sciences, characterized by an growing  legitimacy  and an increasing number of white scholars entering the field. Prior to this time, black scholars did the majority of the research conducted on African-American studies. The Emergence of African-American Studies Departments The student strike of 1968 - 1969, held at San Francisco State University (SFSU), forced the establishment of the Division of Ethnic Studies and departments of Black, Asian, Chicano, and Native Studies. The Black Student Union at  SFSU  drafted a political statement, ""The Justification for African-American Studies,"" that would become the main document for developing African-American studies departments at more than sixty universities. The demands/objectives within this document included the opposition of the ""liberal-fascist"" ideology that was  rampant  on campus (as shown by college administrations who had attempted to pacify Black Student Union demands for systemic curriculum by offering one or two courses in black history and literature); the preparation of black students for direct participation in the struggles of the black community and to define themselves as responsible to and for the future successes of that community; the reinforcement of the position that black people in Africa and the diaspora have the right to democratic rights, self-determination, and liberation; and opposition to the dominant ideology of capitalism, world imperialism and white  supremacy . During this period, Nathan Hare and Jimmy Garrett collaborated to put together the first African-American studies program in the country. African-American studies departments were created in a confrontational environment on American universities with the rejection of traditional curricula content. The curriculum preferred by these departments was to be an ordered arrangement of courses that progressed from introductory to advanced levels.  Darlene Clark Hine  (1990) contends that a sound African-American studies curriculum must include courses in African-American history, literature, and literary criticism. These courses would be complemented by other courses that spoke to the black experience in sociology, political science, psychology, and economics. Furthermore, if resources would permit, courses in art, music, language, and on other geographical areas of the African diaspora should be available. Mainstream university support for African-American studies emerged in the late 1960s. This was done in conjunction with the protests of the civil rights movement, the Black Power movement, and the admission of a massive influx of black students into predominantly white institutions. The preconditions for the growth of African-American studies were demographic, social, and political. Between 1945 and 1965, more than three million blacks left the South and migrated to northeast, north central and western states. The black freedom movement, in both the civil rights phase (1955 - 1965) and Black Power component (1966 - 1975), fostered the racial desegregation and the  empowerment  of black people within previously all-white institutions. The racial composition of U.S. colleges changed dramatically. In 1950 approximately 75,000 blacks were enrolled in colleges and universities. In the 1960s three quarters of all black students attended HBCUs. By 1970, approximately 700,000 blacks were enrolled in college, three quarters of whom were in predominantly white institutions. Organization and Objectives One must be careful not to use African-American studies programs, departments, and centers inter-changeably; they are not synonymous. According to Hine, African-American studies departments are best described as a separate, autonomous unit possessing exclusive rights and privileges to hire and terminate, grant tenure to their faculty, certify students, confer degrees, and administer a budget. Programs may offer majors and minors, but rarely do they confer degrees. Furthermore, faculty appointments in programs are usually joint,  adjunct , or associate positions. Centers, on the other hand, focus more on the production and  dissemination  of scholarship and the professional development of teachers and scholars in the field than on undergraduate teaching. The difference in the structure and mission between centers, departments, and programs tend to complicate the attempt to assess and identify African-American studies accurately. However, Maulana Karenga outlines several objectives that African-American studies seeks to achieve. These basic goals are listed in Table 1. These objectives have served as the backdrop for the discipline since its evolvement in the 1970s. However, the discipline has been under great  scrutiny  and has been challenged by many academics about its objectives and its relevance. Karenga argues that there are fundamental and  undeniable  grounds of relevance of African-American studies that clearly define the field's academic and social contributions and purpose. These are outlined in Table 2. From 1968 to 1971, hundreds of African-American studies departments and programs were developed. Approximately 500 colleges and universities provided full scale African-American studies programs by 1971. Up to 1,300 institutions offered at least one course in African-American studies as of 1974. Some estimates place the number of African-American studies programs reaching its peak at 800 in the early 1970s and declining to about 375, due to the lack of resources and support, by the mid-1990s. African-American studies has been evolving as a result of a radical social movement opposed to institutional racism in U.S. higher education. Considering the conventional roles of American education and its institutionalized racism, African Americans in many sectors view education as  oppressive  and/or liberating. In result, many African Americans began to consider African-American studies and black education as having a special assignment to challenge white mainstream knowledge for its deficiencies and corruption. The development of African-American studies from the very  outset  was marked by blacks being compelled to evaluate the largely racist nature of established education in America. Due to European cultural  hegemony , blacks and Africans in the diaspora have found the issue of perspective to be perennially problematic. The disastrous experience of  chattel  slavery, the basis for cultural hegemony, produced historical discontinuity and preempted normative culture building through a decentering process. Although the experience of  oppression  and exploitation required movement away from an African center, it was this experience that produced the conditions for the emergence of an African-centered consciousness. Thus, the problem of perspective emerged as the black intellectual tradition. Bibliography Adams, Russell L. 1977. ""African-American Studies Perspectives.""

clueweb09-en0009-70-17817	    [  Main Euclid page  ]              Oliver Byrne's edition of Euclid   An unusual and attractive edition of Euclid was published in 1847 in England, edited by an otherwise unknown mathematician named Oliver Byrne.  It covers the first 6 books of Euclid's  Elements of Geometry , which range through most of elementary plane geometry and the theory of proportions.  What distinguishes Byrne's edition is that he attempts to present Euclid's proofs in terms of pictures, using as little text - and in particular  as few labels - as possible.  What makes the book especially striking is his use of colour. Incidentally, at the time of its publication the first 6 books, which are the ones concerrned with plane geometry, made up the basic mathematics curriculum for many students.              With the financial support of several undergraduate organizations at UBC - the Alma Mater Society of UBC, the Science Undergraduate Society at UBC, and the Undergraduate Mathematics Club -  and the cooperation of the Special Collection Division of the UBC Library,  we have had the entire edition photographed by Greg Morton at UBC Biomedical Communications We hope to mount eventually on this site  digital images of all of the photographs. We imagine that it will serve as an interesting resource for geometry projects all over the world.    We have mounted all of Byrne's book, but in the organization of the site is by no means final. We are still experimenting with the images to improve their quality, and sooner or later the structure found for Book VI, which is much better than the rest, will be transported to the other books. If you have any suggestions we'll be pleased to hear from you.   The collection      Introduction    Euclid's Book I   Euclid's Book II   Euclid's Book III   Euclid's Book IV   Euclid's Book V   Euclid's Book VI       We wish to thank Brenda Peterson and her staff in the   UBC Special Collections  for  their help and encouragement.   More about the edition   Oliver Byrne's edition of Euclid was published in 1847 by William Pickering and printed by Chiswick Press. This press has been called by Ruari McLean, a well known author of books on printing and typography,  the foremost name in Victorian book design  and  synonymous with good typography and printing throughout the [Victorian] period . Chiswick Press was operated at that time by Charles Whittingham, nephew of its founder, and Pickering and Whittingham collaborated in a number of innovative publications around that time.  Pickering was  particularly known for elegant title pages. The initial letters for this edition were made by Mary Byfield, who worked regularly at wood-engraving for the firm.    McLean calls Byrne's book  one of the oddest and most beautiful books of the century .  It was one of a very small number of British books displayed at the Great Exhibition of 1851 (no surprise, perhaps, since Whittingham was on one of the Juries of the exhibition). McLean goes on to say  The result is a decided complication of Euclid, but a triumph for Charles Whittingham.  Unfortunately, it is quite likely that the cost of publishing Byrne's book was a major cause of the firm's bankruptcy in 1853.  More than 75% of the stock were still on hand.      Whether or not Byrne's efforts complicate or simplify Euclid is an interesting and debatable point. Parts of Byrne's attempt to design `colour-coded' mathematical proofs are more successful than others, but it is our hope that even the less successful parts can serve as themes for discussion if not  models for imitation. The title page of Byrne's edition, at any rate, illustrates the basic concept of the book rather nicely with a single figure illustrating Euclid's Proposition 47 (Pythagoras' Theorem).    The copy from which this image was taken is in the Colbeck collection of the  Library  of the University of British Columbia . It was purchased in auction in 1974 for about $300.  Byrne's edition became well known recently when extracts from it were included and discussed in the second of Edward Tufte's books on graphical design. A copy of Byrne's book was   auctioned  in November, 1996 for US $3220.   About Oliver Byrne   We have not been able to find out much about Oliver Byrne, and would appreciate any information. From the little we have seen, we would hazard the opinion that in a country, a century, and a profession noted for eccentricity, Byrne was among the most eccentric. August De Morgan (in  A Budget of Paradoxes ) reviews the book  The Creed of Athanasius  by Mr. Byrne, in which he  applies mathematical arguments to theology.      From the Creed:  But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all One: the glory equal, the Majesty coeternal   From Byrne:  It has been shown that infinity, infinity f , infinity g , and  (m  infinity ) s , together, are but infinity, and that each is infinity, and any magnitude in existence represented by infinity always was and always will be: for it cannot be made, or destroyed, and yet exists .      One might add,  Donc Dieu existe!  In the bibliography linked to below this is called a satire, but De Morgan doesn't seem to know it.  Who was fooling whom?      Byrne is also the author of a book  Dual arithmetic  also reviewed in  A Budget of Paradoxes . The proposal is to replace the usual decimal notation ...    De Morgan's editor, the American historian of mathematics David Eugene Smith, doesn't  like the idea of Byrne's edition of Euclid, either, but  unfortunately we do not have De Morgan's opinion of it.

clueweb09-en0001-03-11400	"      Euclid                                     Little is known about Euclid's actual life.  He was living in Alexandria about 300 B.C.E. based on a passage in Proclus'  Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements.   Indeed, much of what is known or conjectured is based on what Proclus says.  After mentioning two students of Plato, Proclus writes    All those who have written histories bring to this point their account of the development of this science.  Not long after these men came Euclid, who brought together the  Elements,  systematizing many of the theorems of Eudoxus, perfecting many of those of Theatetus, and putting in irrefutable demonstrable form propositions that had been rather loosely established by his predecessors.  He lived in the time of Ptolemy the First, for Archimedes, who lived after the time of the first Ptolemy, mentions Euclid.  It is also reported that Ptolemy once asked Euclid if there was not a shorter road to geometry that through the  Elements,  and Euclid replied that there was no royal road to geometry.  He was therefore later than Plato's group but earlier than Eratosthenes and Archimedes, for these two men were contemporaries, as Eratosthenes somewhere says.  Euclid belonged to the persuasion of Plato and was at home in this philosophy; and this is why he thought the goal of the  Elements  as a whole to be the construction of the so-called Platonic figures. (Proclus, ed. Friedlein, p. 68, tr. Morrow)   It is apparent that Proclus had no direct evidence for when Euclid lived, but managed to place him between Plato's students and Archimedes, putting him, very roughly, about 300 B.C.E.  Proclus lived about 800 years later, in the fifth century C.E.   There are a few other historical comments about Euclid.  The most important being Pappus' (fourth century C.E.) comment that Apollonius (third century B.C.E.) studied ""with the students of Euclid at Alexandria.""    Thus, we know almost nothing about Euclid's life.  But we have more of his  writings than any other ancient mathematician.  Besides the  Elements,  there are the  Data, On Divisions of Figures,  the  Phaenomena,  and the  Optics.   All are included in the  Euclidis opera omnia  of Heiberg and Menge (see below) in Greek and translated into Latin.  Other translations are listed below.   Euclid also wrote other books which no longer exist but were mentioned by later writers.  They include  Surface Loci, Porisms, Conics,  and the  Pseudaria  (that is, the  Book of Fallacies ).

Biography   Little is known of Euclid's life except that he taught at Alexandria in Egypt. Most information given on Euclid is not thought to be reliable. Euclid was a very common name around this period, so much of the material that is associated with Euclid of Alexandria is fictitious because there are many references to a man named Euclid. There are three hypotheses surrounding Euclid's life.   1. Euclid was a historical character who wrote the Elements and the other works attributed to him.   2. Euclid was a member of a group of mathematicians working at Alexandria. Each one contributed to writing the 'complete works of Euclid', with the group writing books under Euclid's name even after his death.   3. Euclid of Megara lived about 100 years before Euclid of Alexandria. Euclid of Alexandria didn't exist at all. A group of mathematicians wrote The 'complete works of Euclid and took the name Euclid from Euclid of Megara.    Major Works of Euclid   - The Elements (Stoicheiai)      Have a Say?

Euclid wrote  Elements , a text book containing teachings on algebra, number theory, and especially geometry. Euclid proved his concepts logically, using definitions, axioms, and postulates. Proclus Diadochus wrote a commentary on Euclid's  Elements  that kept Euclid's works in circulation.   Other works by Euclid are:  Division of Figures ,  Data ,  Phaenomena ,  Optics , and three works that have not survived:  Porisms ,  Surface Loci , and  Pseudaria .

Publication  Note:  This was the first American Atlas that was modeled on Le Sage's plan of having explanatory text surrounding the maps. 1st Edition; Fielding Lucas engraved most of the maps.  The 1823 edition was unchanged in most copies, a few have minor map updates, and one (see our copy) has all of the 1827 edition maps while still retaining the 1823 title page and most of the text.  The 1827 edition includes much new material, with all the maps and text updated, except for the Washington, D.C., and Michigan  maps.  A French edition by Buchon was published in 1825, an abridged  London edition in 1823 (see our copies), and a German edition by C.F. Weiland in 1824-1828 (P1225, Espenhorst 1.6.3).   The maps are beautifully drawn and colored.  Lucas went on to publish his own General Atlas in 1823, using similar maps but without the text.  Rebound into half leather tan paper covered boards with ""American Atlas.  1822."" stamped in gilt along the spine.

clueweb09-enwp01-82-12148	"                     The Rhyming Poem          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search              Wikisource  has original text related to this article:  The Rhyming Poem       The Rhyming Poem , also written as  The Riming Poem , is an  Old English  poem of 87 lines found in the  Exeter Book , a tenth-century collection of  Anglo-Saxon  poetry. It is remarkable for being no later than the 10th century, in  Old English , and written in rhyming couplets.  Rhyme  is otherwise virtually unknown among Anglo-Saxon literature, which used  alliterative verse  instead.   The poem is found on folios 94r-95v, in the third booklet of the Exeter Book, which may, or may not, be an indication of composition. Many scholarly attempts have been made to decipher the collation of the Exeter Book and to determine if works were placed in the manuscript by date or theme. Unlike the  Monstrarum Librum  of the  Beowulf  manuscript, the Exeter Book appears to be a self-consciously archival collection.   The poem concerns the troubles and transience of life. It contrasts the life of a ruler, from the time of his birth to his prosperous rule and life at court (lines 1-42), with his life after his fall, the subsequent rise of hostilities (lines 43-69) and his death (lines 70-79), ending with a reflection on the eternal glories of Heaven and the necessity of penance (lines 80-87). The poet may have taken  Book of Job , chapters 29 and 30, as its inspiration.     [ edit ]   Bibliography     The Rhymming Poem     Macrae-Gibson, O.D. (ed. and tr.).  The Old English Riming Poem .

Contents       1   Life   2   Writing   3   Visual art   4   Works     4.1   Fiction   4.2   Translations   4.3   Poetry   4.4   Fugitive pieces   4.5   Commentary and essays   4.6   Paintings and drawings   4.7   Letters       5   Criticism, reviews, and interviews   6   Published bibliography   7   Notes   8   External links               [ edit ]   Life   Guy Davenport was born in  Anderson ,  South Carolina , in the foothills of  Appalachia  on  November 23 ,  1927 . His father was an agent for the  Railway Express Agency . Davenport said that he became a reader only at age ten, with a neighbors gift of one of the  Tarzan  series. [ 1 ]  At age eleven, he began a neighborhood newspaper, drawing all the illustrations and writing all the stories. [ 2 ]  At age thirteen, he ""broke [his] right leg (skating) and was laid up for a wearisome while""; it was then that he began ""reading with real interest"", [ 3 ]  beginning with a biography of  Leonardo . [ 4 ]  He left high school early and enrolled at  Duke University  a few weeks after his seventeenth birthday. [ 5 ]  At Duke, he studied  art [ 6 ] (with  Clare Leighton ), graduating with a degree in  classics  and  English literature .   Davenport was a  Rhodes Scholar  at  Merton College, Oxford , from 1948 to 1950. He studied  Old English  under  J. R. R. Tolkien  and wrote Oxfords first thesis on  James Joyce . In 1950, upon his return to the United States, Davenport was drafted into the  U.S. Army  for two years, spending them at  Fort Bragg  in the  756th Field Artillery , then in the  XVIII Airborne Corps . After the army, he taught at  Washington University in St. Louis  until 1955, when he began earning a Ph.D. at  Harvard , studying under  Harry Levin  and  Archibald MacLeish .   Davenport befriended  Ezra Pound  during the poets incarceration in  St. Elizabeths Hospital , visiting him annually from 1952 until Pound's release in 1958, and later at his home in  Rapallo ,  Italy . Davenport described one such visit, in 1963, in the story ""Ithaka"". Davenport wrote his dissertation on Pounds poetry, published as  Cities on Hills  in 1983.   After completing his Ph.D., he taught at  Haverford College  from 1961 to 1963 but soon took a position at the  University of Kentucky , ""the remotest offer with the most pay"" (as he wrote to  Jonathan Williams ). Davenport taught at Kentucky until he received a  MacArthur Fellowship , which prompted his retirement at the end of 1990.   Davenport was married briefly in the early 1960s. [ 7 ]  He dedicated  Eclogues , 1981, to ""Bonnie Jean"" (Cox), his companion from 1965 [ 8 ]  until his death. [ 9 ]  Other Davenport volumes dedicated to Cox include  Objects on a Table , 1998, and  The Death of Picasso , 2004. Cox became Trustee for the Guy Davenport Estate. [ 10 ]   The range of Davenport's literary and artistic friendships was remarkable. In addition to Pound and Williams, Davenport knew  Hugh Kenner ,  Laurence Scott ,  Louis Zukofsky ,  Samuel Beckett ,  Christopher Middleton ,  Thomas Merton ,  Wendell Berry ,  Buckminster Fuller ,  Eudora Welty ,  Samuel Delany ,  Robert Kelly ,  James Laughlin ,  Allen Ginsberg ,  Stan Brakhage ,  Ronald Johnson , and  Ralph Eugene Meatyard , his neighbor.   Two sentences he wrote about Meatyard apply to himself as well: ""He was rare among American artists in that he was not obsessed with his own image in the world. He could therefore live in perfect privacy in a rotting Kentucky town."" [ 11 ]   Davenport bought Oscar Mayer bologna, fried it, and ate it with Campbell's soup [ 12 ] .   He died of  lung cancer  on  January 4 ,  2005 .     [ edit ]   Writing   Davenport began publishing fiction in 1970 with ""The Aeroplanes at  Brescia ,"" which is based on  Kafka 's visit to an air show in September 1909. His books include  Tatlin ! ,  Da Vinci 's Bicycle ,  Eclogues ,  Apples and Pears ,  The  Jules Verne  Steam Balloon ,  The Drummer of the Eleventh North  Devonshire   Fusiliers ,  A Table of Green Fields ,  The  Cardiff  Team , and  Wo es war, soll ich werden . His fiction uses three general modes of exposition: the fictionalizing of historical events and figures; the foregrounding of formal narrative experiments, especially with the use of  collage ; and the depicting of a  Fourierist   utopia , where small groups of men, women, and children have eliminated the separation between mind and body.   The first of more than four hundred Davenport essays, articles, introductions, and book reviews appeared while he was still an undergraduate; the last, just weeks before his death. Davenport was a regular reviewer for  National Review  and  The Hudson Review , and, late in his life, at the invitation of  John Jeremiah Sullivan , he spent a year writing the ""New Books"" column for  Harper's Magazine . His essays range from literary to social topics, from brief book reviews to lectures such as the title piece in his first collection of essays,  The Geography of the Imagination . His other collections of essays were  Every Force Evolves a Form  and  The Hunter  Gracchus  and Other Papers on Literature and Art .   He also published two slim volumes on art:  A  Balthus  Notebook  and  Objects on a Table . Although he wrote on many topics, Davenport, who never had a driver's license, was especially passionate about the destruction of American cities by the automobile.   Davenport wrote a handful of poems. The longest are the book-length  Flowers and Leaves , an intricate meditation on art and America, and ""The Resurrection in  Cookham  Churchyard"" (borrowing the title from a painting by  Stanley Spencer ). A selection of his poems and translations was published as  Thasos  and  Ohio .   Davenport translated ancient  Greek  texts, particularly from the  archaic  period. These were published in periodicals, then small volumes, and finally collected in  7 Greeks . He also translated the occasional other piece, including a few poems of  Rilke 's, some  ancient Egyptian  texts [after  Boris de Rachewiltz ]), and, with  Benjamin Urrutia , the sayings of  Jesus , published as  The  Logia  of  Yeshua .     [ edit ]   Visual art   With his childhood newspaper, Davenport launched both his literary and artistic vocations. The former remained dormant or sporadic for some time while the latter, ""making drawings, watercolors, and  gouaches , [continued] throughout school, the army, and his early years as a teacher."" [ 13 ]  He drew or painted nearly every day of his life, [ 14 ]  and his notebooks contain drawings and pasted-in illustrations and photos cheek by jowl with his own observations and other writings and quotations from others.   From college forward, Davenport supplied cover art and decorations to literary periodicals. He also supplied illustrations for others' books, notably two by  Hugh Kenner :  The Stoic Comedians  (1962) and  The Counterfeiters  (1968).  [ 15 ]       The cover of  Apples and Pears  by Guy Davenport       As a visual artist (and childhood newspaper magnate) who also wrote, Davenport had a lifelong interest in printing and book design. His poems and fictions were often first published in  limited editions  by small press craftsmen. [ 16 ]   In 1965 Davenport and  Laurence Scott  prepared and printed Pound's Canto CX in an edition of 118 copies, 80 of which they presented to Pound for his 80th birthday. The previous year they had produced  Ezra's Bowmen of  Shu  on the same press, a double broadside that published for the first time, with a brief introductory essay by Davenport, a drawing by sculptor  Henri Gaudier-Brzeska  and a letter of Gaudier's from the trenches of World War I that cites Pound's poem (translated from one in the  Shi Jing ) ""The Song of the Bowmen of Shu"" [ 17 ] .   Many of Davenport's earlier stories are combinations of pictures and text, especially  Tatlin!  and  Apples and Pears  (where some of the illustrations are of pages that resemble those of his own notebooks).   ""It was my intention, when I began writing fiction several years ago, to construct texts that were both written and drawn. [ . . . ] I continued this method right through  Apples and Pears  [ . . . ]. The designer [of A+P] understood [my] collages to be gratuitous illustrations having nothing to do with anything, reduced them all to burnt toast, framed them with nonsensical lines, and sabotaged my whole enterprise. I took this as final defeat, and haven't tried to combine drawing and writing in any later work of fiction.""

L. Carr  to publish his maps, pocket books and novels.  [ 1 ]  It is now run by his son Robert Carr and his wife, Jane.           Contents       1   History of the press   2   Novels by J.L. Carr published by the Quince Tree Press   3   Illustrated Maps   4   Small books     4.1   Poets   4.2   Collected Poems   4.3   Dictionaries   4.4   Artist's picture books   4.5   Other picture books   4.6   Inflammatory evangelical tracts   4.7   Others       5   Commissioned Celebratory Cards   6   Notes   7   External links               [ edit ]   History of the press   When Carr took 2-year leave of absence from teaching in 1967 aged 55 and with savings of 1,600, [ 1 ]  his aim was to see if he could make his living by selling decorated maps of English counties and small, illustrated pocket books of poets and idiosyncratic dictionaries.  [ 2 ]  These he published from his house at Mill Dale Road in  Kettering ,  Northamptonshire  under the imprint The Quince Tree Press. The  quince  is a fruiting tree native to the  Caucasus  and there was one in the front garden of Carr's house.   Carr's small books are typically 16 stapled pages, usually about 12.5 x 9.5 cm, with decorated card covers. A few are numbered; some are dated. Carr wrote: 'These books fit small envelopes, go for a minimum stamp and are perfect for cold bedrooms - only one hand and a wrist need suffer exposure'. Carr recorded in 1983 that sales of the small books reached a peak in 1980, when he sold 43,369 copies, [ 3 ]  and by 1987 he had sold more than 500,000 in total. [ 1 ]   At the age of 76 years and unhappy with the six different publishers of his six novels to date and with the advance that he had been offered for his seventh novel, Carr decided to publish the next book himself.  What Hetty Did  was published as a paperback by the Quince Tree Press in 1988 in an edition of 2,850 copies and was soon reprinted. [ 2 ]  Carr followed this novel four years later with  Harpole & Foxberrow General Publishers  in an edition of 4,000 copies. Carr sold his novels and small books published by the Quince Tree Press directly to booksellers and by mail order to readers, and offered copies of his other novels bought as remainders from his previous publishers. For example Carr obtained 900 remaindered copies of  The Harpole Report  from  Secker and Warburg  at 12 pence each  [ 3 ]  and was able to sell them all at their full price of 1.75 after  Frank Muir  had named it on  Desert Island Discs  as the book he would take with him to the imaginary island. [ 2 ]   In his life time Carr bought back the rights to the novels  How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the F.A. Cup  and  A Month in the Country  and published them under the imprint of the Quince Tree Press. Since Carr's death in 1994 the Quince Tree Press have reprinted all Carr's novels and continue to publish existing and new pocket books and maps.   In each of his novels published by the Quince Tree Press Carr cited words by  Beatrice Warde , an eminent American typographer: ""This is a Printing Office, cross-roads of civilisation, Refuge of all the Arts against the Ravages of Time. From this place Words may fly abroad, not to perish as waves of sound but fix'd in Time, not corrupted by the hurrying hand but verified in Proof. Friend, you are on Safe Ground: this is a Printing Office.""     [ edit ]   Novels by J.L. Carr published by the Quince Tree Press     (1988)  What Hetty Did .  ISBN 0900847913 . First edition.

[ edit ]   Illustrated Maps   Carr drew his first map in 1943, of England and Wales, while stationed in west Africa during the Second World War. [ 2 ]  Rather than being geographical, Carr's maps are of architectural and historical interest and give brief details, observations and quotations in a quirky style about buildings, historical events and people related to places in the old  counties of England , before they were reorganised in 1974. The maps are meant to be read and framed and to stimulate conversation. [ 2 ]   Carr reported that the first four maps were of Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, Kent and Norfolk and initially sold for 1 each. [ 3 ]  The first five maps given ISBNs were Hampshire (December 1968; ISBN 900847034), Wales (March 1969, ISBN 900847042), Sussex (June 1969; ISBN 900847050), Kent (September, 1969; ISBN 900847018) and Yorkshire (September 1969; ISBN 900847026). The last map to be given an ISBN was issued in December 1976 (Westmoreland, ISBN 900847751).   The different versions of most county maps were not numbered or dated. Versions may be distinguished by the number of sheets printed, which was usually recorded on later maps, and assuming that the number was different for each version. The first versions of maps seem to have been issued in editions of 250, 350 or 500 sheets. Bob Carr has reported that some of the maps had editions related to the year in which they were printed. For example, an edition of 978 sheets was probably first published in 1978. The number of sheets of the versions recorded with an ISBN, seen or held in private or public collections are given below and range from 250 to 982 with an average of about 750. If the number of sheets issued was recorded on the version then each sheet was usually numbered by hand, although unnumbered copies are known. The number of different versions published as of August 1987 is shown in parentheses below  [ 1 ]  and at least three new maps (Buckinghamshire, Westmoreland and Wiltshire) were added after then. There may be more maps and more versions. A new map of Northamptonshire was produced in 2005 by Bob and Jane Carr.   Carr's illustrated maps were printed on single sheets of thick paper of various types and range in size from 50 to 65 cm high and 35 to 55 cm wide, depending on the shape of each county. The early maps were in monochrome but some may have been hand coloured by Sally Carr. [ 1 ]  Later maps were coloured. Many maps were numbered by hand and signed by Carr. The maps were chiefly printed by Messrs Richardson or Seddon. [ 1 ]   The list below gives details where known of: the number of different maps of each county, shown in parentheses, as recorded by Carr in 1987 in his history of the Quince Tree Press; [ 1 ]  the date of publication with the ISBN, although such numbers seem only to have been applied to maps published between 1968 and 1976; and the number of sheets, if known.

Carr launched the series in 1966 with a books of poems by William Blake, Andrew Marvell and John Clare whose grandson, Albert, a retired co-op milkman, lived on the same road.  [ 3 ]  More than 100 titles are recorded, some produced after Carr's death in 1994 by Bob and Jane Carr. A few books are dated or can be dated by their publication to coincide with a particular event; some are numbered. The numbers are not always unique: at least four are numbered No. 71 (John Donne, Joan Hassall, Bryan North Lee and Geoffrey Chaucer) and two are numbered 99 (John Lawrence and G.K. Chesterton). A very few books list the impressions published. Mostly Carr had 3,000 copies printed at a time, sometimes using a different background colour for a new impression.

Founded in  1938 , it is currently located in the  Bedford Park  section of the  Bronx . Admission is by an exam open to all grade-eligible students in New York City, reportedly taken by more than 20,000 students annually. [ 2 ]  Although known for its focus on  mathematics  and  science , Bronx Science also concentrates intensively on the  humanities  and  social sciences . As a result, it has continually attracted gifted students with a wide variety of interests.   Bronx Science has developed a worldwide reputation [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  as one of the best [ 5 ]  high schools in the United States, public or private, ranking thirty-third in  U.S. News and World Report's  2008 list of America's best ""Gold-Medal"" high schools. [ 6 ]  It attracts an intellectually gifted blend of culturally, ethnically, [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  and economically diverse students from New York City. [ 9 ]  Its students are required to study five major subjects each semester, as compared to four major subjects required in nearly all of the other public high schools.   Almost all Bronx Science graduates go on to four-year colleges; many attend  Ivy League  and other highly selective schools. [ 10 ]  Bronx Science has counted 131 finalists in the prestigious  Intel  (formerly Westinghouse)  Science Talent Search , the largest number of any high school. [ 11 ]  Seven  Nobel Prize -winning scientists  more than any other secondary education institution in the world  and seven  Pulitzer Prize -winning authors are among the many  notable Bronx Science graduates . [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Bronx Science is a member of the  National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology  (NCSSSMST). [ 14 ]  Together with  Stuyvesant High School  and  Brooklyn Technical High School , it is one of three original ""specialized"" science high schools operated by the  New York City Department of Education .

They were given use of an antiquated Gothic-gargoyled edifice located at Creston Avenue and 184th Street. The building, built in  1918  for Evander Childs High School, had been successively occupied by  Walton High School  ( 1930 ) and by an annex of  DeWitt Clinton High School  ( 1935 ). The initial faculty were comprised in part by a contingent from  Stuyvesant High School . [ 15 ]  Principal Meister put his imprint on the school from its formation, for example selecting as school colors ""green to represent chlorophyll and gold the sun, both of which are essential to the chain of life."" [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Expansion to co-education   Bronx Science started with about 150 ninth year students and 250 tenth year students, the remaining facilities of the building being used by DeWitt Clinton. As Science became larger, the Clinton contingent was gradually returned to its own main building. During their joint occupation, which lasted for 2 years, until  1940 , the two schools had separate teaching staff and classes, but the same supervision and administration.   In  1946 , as a result of the efforts of Principal Meister, the faculty, and the Parents Association, the school became co-ed, preceding its rival schools Stuyvesant ( 1969 ) by 23 years, and Brooklyn Tech ( 1972 ) by 26 years. This opened the doors to gifted and talented girls of New York, giving them equal opportunity to pursue a quality education in a specialized high school, previously denied to them.   In February  1958 , Morris Meister, after 20 years as the principal of the school, resigned to become the first president of the newly organized  Bronx Community College . Alexander Taffel succeeded Meister as principal.     [ edit ]   The move to modern facilities   From the very beginning, a campaign for a new building was conducted by the Parents Association and Principal Morris Meister. Working with the Board of Education and the City of New York took twenty years to see the dream become a reality, but under Principal Taffel's guidance, plans were finally completed for a new building specifically designed by the large architectural firm of  Emery Roth and Sons [ 17 ]  and equipped for the Bronx High School of Science. The new building would be on 205th Street near Bedford Park Boulevard, in a predominantly institutional area, commonly referred to as the ""Educational Mile"" between DeWitt Clinton High School and its large football field on one side, and Harris Field and  Hunter College  (now  Lehman College ) on the other. On  March 3 ,  1959 , students and faculty occupied the new building for the first time, solving the problem of how to move the books from the old library to the new in typical Bronx Science manner: on Friday afternoon each student took home five library books from the old building, and on Monday returned them to the new one.          Bronx High School of Science       They entered a school equipped with the most modern facilities and state-of-the-art laboratories, classrooms, and technical studio areas, all designed to the specific needs of the specialized Bronx Science curriculum. Gracing the main lobby entrance was a large, 63-foot, Venetian glass mosaic mural depicting major figures from the history of science such as  Marie Curie  and  Charles Darwin  under the protective hands of a God-like figure representing knowledge, with this quote from  John Dewey : ""Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination."" The mural is an original work of art by  Frank J. Reilly  entitled  Humanities Protecting Biology, Physics, Chemistry,  reflecting the breadth of the school's mission: to excel not only in the sciences and mathematics for which it was founded, but also in the humanities. Legions of students over the years, bemoaning the lack of swimming facilities, have sarcastically referred to the mural as ""the Science swimming pool"", perpetuating the idea - perhaps apochryphal - that a choice was made to fund a mural rather than a pool in the new building; but the mural continues to epitomize the special nature of the Bronx High School of Science. [ 18 ]   The move was not without incident. In the first spring of the move, rumors swept the school that various Bronx  youth street gangs  were coming to the school, and that the  Fordham Baldies  would shave the hair of Science students. This never happened. Another incident did happen that spring: The first time Science girls appeared on the outdoor physical education field in skimpy shorts/t-shirts (which probably showed less than in the average high school in 2006), some students from the neighboring, all-male  DeWitt Clinton High School  charged the separation fence between their field and the Science field. The fence held, but the female students exercised indoors for the remainder of that year.   When Bronx Science celebrated its silver anniversary in June 1963, President  John F. Kennedy  hailed it as ""a significant and pathfinding example of a special program devoted to the development of the student gifted in science and mathematics."" The President had occasion to know the quality of the school's product since he had recently selected one of its graduates,  Harold Brown , of the class of 1943, for the position of Director of Defense Research and Engineering; he would later serve as Secretary of Defense under President  Jimmy Carter .     [ edit ]   Holocaust Museum and Studies Center          The Stuart S. Elenko Holocaust Museum and Studies Center       In  1978 , Stuart S. Elenko, a popular Social Studies faculty member, single-handedly founded a Holocaust Museum and Studies Center at Bronx Science. It has been funded by grants, donations, and the New York City Council. The Museum was one of the first of its kind in the United States, and houses an impressive collection of rare documents, photographs, artifacts and other material from the Nazi era; the Studies Center sponsors speakers and puts together and distributes educational materials about the Holocaust. The Museum has had over 60,000 visitors, and has received wide acclaim from leaders in the field. In  2003 , the Museum celebrated its 25th Anniversary with a gala. In  2004  an anonymous benefactor - an alumnus of the school - made a very large donation which is allowing the Museum to modernize and be totally revamped; eventually it will move out of the library where it now resides, and turned into a full-sized museum. In  2006 , the Museum finally moved out of its original home into a larger space. Its facilities have been upgraded to include a plasma television screen and a computer to display presentations about different topics related to the Holocaust. Renovations are still being made to improve the aesthetics of the new location.   Tours of the museum are given by students in the Holocaust Leadership Class to any guest that requests one, as well as to sophomore World History students. The Museum and the tours have received tremendous reviews and only add to the excellent educational experience. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Recent administration   When Alexander Taffel retired as principal in  1978 , the chairman of the Biological Science Department, Milton Kopelman, became Principal. [ 20 ]  He remained so for over ten years. Upon Principal Kopelman's retirement in  1990 , long-time faculty member and Biology Assistant Principal Vincent Galasso became Principal. He was followed by Physical Science Department Assistant Principal Stanley Blumenstein, a  1963  graduate of Bronx Science.   In  2000  William Stark, a popular Assistant Principal of the Social Studies Department, was appointed Acting Principal. He was expected to move up to the Principal's office, when Chancellor Harold O. Levy decided to try to find a Nobel laureate to become Principal; that effort failed, but Stark was still not offered the job as principal. Stark gave an ultimatum which said that if he wasn't officially offered the job by a certain date, he would take another position being offered to him elsewhere. When the deadline came and went, Stark accepted a job as Principal of Manhasset High School. Many faculty and parents were upset that Stark was not appointed in a timely way and thus had left the school; Vincent Galasso agreed to an interim appointment for one term in  2001 . Then, despite Levy's desire to appoint a Nobel laureate, Valerie J. Reidy, Assistant Principal of the Biology Department, was appointed Principal in September 2001; she was the first woman Principal in the school's history. She has been a controversial figure, and several teachers left the school in response to her becoming principal. Some teachers have openly criticized her to newspapers, and the general opinion of the students is one of dislike. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  Most recently, this resulted in student protests in 2005 and 2008 [ 23 ]  objecting to the administration's policy on cutting classes, and worrying that the administration's policies are driving away teachers deemed insubordinate.     [ edit ]   Enrollment   The Bronx High School of Science has a student body of about 2,800 students. Admission is based exclusively on an entrance examination, known as the  Specialized High Schools Admissions Test  (SHSAT), [ 24 ]  open to all eighth and ninth grade New York City students interested in attending one of the specialized schools. Each year, thousands of students from the five boroughs of New York City take this comprehensive examination covering math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension, logical reasoning, unscrambling paragraphs). Out of the 26,000 students taking the entrance examination only about 700 are admitted to Science, based on a system of ranked scores.   The student body is diversified, comprising almost every ethnic group in New York City. In 2008, 59.92% of the school was of Asian descent. [ 25 ]  The students are evenly split between males and females. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Facilities and resources          A monitor in the front lobby of Bronx Science allows students and faculty to monitor the status of the school's rooftop  solar array .         Computerized & renovated science laboratories, including the  Syracuse University  @ Bronx Science Crime Lab and DNA Research Lab   Television studio   Computer laboratories   Weather Station   Rooftop planetarium   High speed internet access in every room   Televisions equipped with DVD/VHS players in every room   Advanced library       The Bronx Science Library supports the student body by providing extensive resources ranging from traditional print and microform to electronic subscription e-journals and databases rivaling many higher institutions. Located on the first floor just off the main lobby, the library is composed of three smaller rooms encompassing approximately  65,000 square feet (6,000 m)  with a seating capacity of 100. Holdings include over 30,000 volumes, 135 different magazines, microforms (including the New York Times on microfilm dating back to 1851) and readers, and computers in the computer room. Every available space is productively used, and presents a comfortable and attractive environment for students who use the library for study, relaxation, and computer activities.       Especially notable among its electronic resources is  ScienceDirect , a free science journal service provided by  Elsevier  to a select few science high schools. It is used by students in their own original research endeavors as a gateway to firsthand experience with published scientific research. The library currently also contains the Holocaust Museum and Studies Center. [ 27 ]       Distance Learning Lab   Animal Room   Nationally renowned on-site Holocaust Museum   2 rooftop greenhouses   Foreign Language Multimedia Learning Center   Rooftop solar arrays       Completed in February 2006, the installation of  solar panels  provides advanced instructional facilities. The 33.6 kW (DC) photovoltaic (PV) arrays consist of 168 Sharp Solar 200 watt DC PV modules laminated to PowerLight's flat-roof PowerGuard mounting system and utilizes a Xantrex PV-30208 30 kW AC 3 phase inverter. Integration with the school's computer network provides a hands-on approach with an economical and ecological power source by allowing students to monitor the solar panels' production of electricity in real time, while reaping savings on energy cost. A screen just off the main lobby displays production data at every moment. [ 28 ]       [ edit ]   Academics          Students relaxing on Science's campus in warm weather.       Bronx Science students take a rigorous, well-rounded, college preparatory curriculum that includes four years of lab science, math, English, social studies, three years of foreign language and a year of fine arts, with required courses and a wide selection of electives, including AP classes. Over 600 classes are offered. [ 29 ]  Students have an opportunity to do independent research, and many compete in the annual  Intel Science Talent Search  (formerly known as ""Westinghouse""). After the completion of four years at Bronx Science, and the fulfillment of the Bronx Science academic track, students graduate with a Bronx Science degree - more advanced and more prestigious than a typical New York State Regents Degree.   The core science courses chosen are typically earth sciences,  biology ,  chemistry , and  physics ; many students choose to take the  Advanced Placement  versions of these courses, which allow students to place out of introductory college science courses that match Science rigour. In the life sciences, the students have the additional option of taking a special ""double honors"" biology course, which features extra laboratory exposure. Science electives include microbiology, physiology, forensic science, human genetics, evolution, astronomy, organic chemistry, electronics and others.   In mathematics, beyond the standard AP courses in AB/BC  calculus  and  statistics , courses in multivariable calculus and computer science (including AP Computer Science) are among the choices. A course in linear algebra and differential equations was offered for the first time in fall 2007.   Students take four years of  English , which also allows for electives, including courses in  journalism ,  Shakespeare ,  creative writing  and AP English.   Social studies and history classes are required, and include US and world history, economics, with electives in psychology, law, finance, and global studies, among others.   Three years of languages are required. Bronx Science offers  French ,  Spanish ,  Latin ,  Italian ,  Russian ,  Modern Greek ,  Chinese ,  Japanese , and  Korean . At one time  Hebrew  and  German  were also offered.   Students are required to take Technical Drawing (formerly known as Mechanical Drawing) and a Science Techniques Laboratory course; technology courses include engineering and architectural drawing, telescope making, computerized graphics, robotics technology, and medical illustration.

Interested students may apply for research programs in their freshman year and begin a three-year sequence of voluntary work on their projects in their sophomore year. During this time, students collaborate with scientists at local laboratories to develop and complete an independent research project, usually concentrated during two summers. The program culminates in the writing of a scientific paper in the senior year, which is submitted to various competitions, such as the Intel Science Talent Search (""Westinghouse"") competition. Since the inception of this prestigious national competition in 1942, Bronx Science has accumulated the highest number of finalists: 125.     [ edit ]   Publications          Bronx Science students working on the publication of the Science Survey in the newspaper publication room.         The Observatory  is Bronx Science's prizewinning yearbook.   Science Survey  is Bronx Science's entirely student-run newspaper. Students manage everything: reporting, layout, design, editing, and final production. The paper runs purely on funds from its advertisers, with no fiscal school support. The paper is distributed 5 times per year, gratis.  Survey  has been the name of the Bronx Science student newspaper since the founding of the school in 1938.   Math Bulletin  is the annual publication of the Bronx Science Mathematics Department. Student term papers, original student mathematics research, and interesting topics in mathematics are featured.   Reactions  is a school publication written by Physical Science students.       Dynamo  is the literary magazine of the Bronx Science English Department. The entire student body is encouraged to submit original poems and other works which are considered for publication.       Bronx Science publishes an annual Biology Journal. It is a joint venture between students and the faculty of the Biology Department to document advances in the field, both within Bronx Science and in the outside world. Each themed issue contains interviews, commentaries, artwork, featured student research papers, and abstracts from every student Biology research project that year (see  Research ).       Exposition  is an annual production of the Bronx Science Social Studies Department.

Sodikow, the Bronx High School of Science Speech and Debate Team has been prominent and successful. With the creation of the annual  Lincoln-Douglas Debate  in 1979, came the creation of the Bronx Science LD squad which has had national success. David Yalof won the national championship in 1984, and two years later, Hee-Sun Hong received the first-ever Tournament of Champions title in Lincoln-Douglas Debate. In 1988, Jonathan Koppell and Peter Colavito closed out the final round of the Tournament of Champions.   Bronx Science debaters have amassed many major titles:  Emory University 's Barkley Forum for High Schools, the  Harvard  National Invitational, the Lexington Winter Classic, Hendrick Hudson, T.A. Edison,  University of Southern California , Villiger, the Northeast Regional Championships, the Newark Debates, the Westchester Classic, the Robert J.

Once boys were required to wear ties and ""collar"" shirts and not allowed to wear ""patch-pocket"" pants (jeans) or hats; girls were required to wear skirts or dresses, no matter what the weather. Offenders were sent home if they were not dressed according to the rules. Many girls walking to school in the winter along wind-swept Goulden Avenue between the Jerome Park Reservoir and Clinton's football field, wore slacks under their skirts and removed them when they arrived at school. Boots also had to be removed.   In 1968 the students successfully demanded that the dress code be relaxed; girls then were allowed to wear slacks and boys could wear t-shirts.   Today's students still are not allowed to wear hats (a NYC Department of Education rule), and the dress regulations are less specific, forbidding clothing that is ""distracting"", ""offensive"", or ""degrading""; anything promoting drug use or offensive language is similarly banned; and ""undergarments must not be visible, and tops and bottoms of outer garments must meet or overlap"". [ 40 ]     [ edit ]   Faculty   The Bronx Science faculty comprises educators who possibly represent one of the most highly qualified high-school teaching staffs in the world. Many hold advanced degrees, including the  Ph.D. , in their field, and many have taught at universities. A rigorous hiring process fosters qualified staff: Unlike most New York City public schools, teachers are not hired according to seniority. Instead, teachers are interviewed and a committee of current teachers from the department meets to decide whether or not an individual upholds the qualities of a potential Bronx Science faculty member. So, although many new teachers are young and un-tenured, they come to the classroom familiar with the up-to-date methods of instruction.   Strong alumni relations are apparent at Bronx Science. In fact, many teachers are alumni of the school: Michael Contente (ret. June 2007), the former coordinator of the Department of Mathematics (1966); Jean M. Donahue, Ph.D., the assistant principal of the Department of Biology (1977); Fred Levy, assistant principal of the art, music, and technology departments; David Cohen (math and technology), Richard Lee (biology), Sherrill Mirsky (math), Beatrice Robertson (math), Polly Schoenfeld (English), and Daniel Abella (filmmaking). Surprisingly, because of such relations, many teachers have had other teachers as students at Science at some time during their career.          James Perna, a Teacher of the Year       Many teachers are approachable and willing to help students. Students can speak to their teachers before and after class, or schedule a conference with their teachers during lunch or a free period. Students can also communicate with their teachers via  e-mail , which is provided free of charge to the entire Bronx Science staff, faculty, and student body, through the school's  computer network .   Many teachers also play an active role in the advancement of the school's vision. For example, Fanny K. Ennever, Ph.D., a teacher in the Physical Science Department and adjunct assistant professor at  Columbia University , [ 41 ]  was responsible for securing a $27,500 grant in both 2004 and 2005 for developing and modifying the Bronx Science chemistry laboratory curriculum, in order to make sessions less ""cookbook"" and more inquiry-based. [ 42 ]   Every year, the senior members of ARISTA  National Honor Society  vote for the Honored Teacher Award, honoring a teacher they believe has gone well above and beyond the call of duty in educating their students. No one teacher can win this distinction more than once, thereby ensuring that all teachers have a chance to be acknowledged. Winners of the award include Patricia Nunez, Gregory Greene, and James Perna. During the 2007-2008 school year, the award was offered and shared amongst Mr. Reutershan (Multivariable Calculus), Dr. Wheeler (Advanced Placement Biology), and Mrs. Ramos (Advanced Placement Chemistry).     [ edit ]   Popular references   In Season 1, Episode 18 of  The West Wing ,  Mallory O'Brien  mentions Bronx Science in a discussion of public school reform and school vouchers.  Rob Lowe 's character,  Sam Seaborn  says,  Boston Latin , the oldest public school in the country, is still the best secondary school in New England. Mallory O'Brien replies ""They all can't be Boston Latin and Bronx Science.""   In the television show  Head of the Class , Bronx Science is named explicitly throughout the show as Fillmore High School's rival, often appearing against them in academic competitions.   In Season 1, Episode 12 of What I Like About You, Henry says he goes to Bronx Science and has a GPA of 3.7.   In one episode of Everybody Hates Chris, Chris and his friend both apply for Bronx Science. In the end, though, only Chris's friend was accepted, but not himself.   Northern Exposure was a show about a doctor whose medical education was financed by an Alaskan town where he was then obliged to work. Dr. Joel Fleischman (played by Rob Morrow) often reminisced about his high school days at Bronx Science. Ironically, when Dr. Fleischman's role dimisnished, he was succeeded by Dr. Phil Capra, played by Paul Provenza, who is an actual Bronx Science graduate.     [ edit ]   Notable alumni and former students   The Bronx High School of Science counts  seven  Nobel Prize -winning  physicists among its graduates:     Leon N. Cooper  1947,  Brown University  awarded the  1972   Nobel Prize in Physics   Sheldon L. Glashow  1950,  Boston University , awarded the  1979  Nobel Prize in Physics   Steven Weinberg  1950,  University of Texas at Austin , awarded the  1979  Nobel Prize in Physics   Melvin Schwartz  1949,  Columbia University , awarded the  1988  Nobel Prize in Physics   Russell A. Hulse  1966,  Princeton University , awarded the  1993  Nobel Prize in Physics   H. David Politzer  1966,  California Institute of Technology , awarded the  2004  Nobel Prize in Physics   Roy J. Glauber  1941,  Harvard University , awarded the  2005  Nobel Prize in Physics     No other secondary school in the world has as many alumni who have won Nobel Prizes.   If Bronx Science were a country, it would be tied at 23rd with Spain for number of Nobel laureates (as of 2008). Were Bronx Science a university, it would be tied for 58th place, matching UNC-Chapel Hill, UMD and McGill.   Bronx Science also has  six  Pulitzer Prize -winning  graduates:     William Sherman  1963, reporter at the  New York Daily News , awarded  1974   William Safire  1947, author and columnist at  The New York Times , awarded  1978   Joseph Lelyveld  1954, Executive Editor at  The New York Times , awarded  1986   Bernard L. Stein  1959, Editor of the  Riverdale Press , awarded  1998   William Taubman  1958, Professor of  Political Science  at  Amherst College , awarded  2004   Gene Weingarten , 1968, reporter and columnist for  The Washington Post , awarded  2008 [ 43 ]     Six alumni have won the  National Medal of Science , the nation's highest scientific honor bestowed by the U.S. President and thus far awarded to 425 scientists and engineers. Bronx Science also counts among its graduates twenty-nine current members of the  United States National Academy of Sciences  (NAS), an honor attained by only about 2,000 American scientists. Twenty-two Bronx Science graduates are current members of the  United States National Academy of Engineering  (NAE), ten are current members of the  Institute of Medicine  (IOM), and at least one is a current member of the  Royal Society of Canada .

clueweb09-enwp03-37-21555	"                     Patience Strong          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Winifred Emma May )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Winifred Emma May  (4 June 1907  28 August 1990) was a  poet  from the  United Kingdom , best known for her work under the  pen name   Patience Strong . Her poems were usually short, simple and imbued with sentimentality, the beauty of nature and inner strength. She was also a successful lyricist, composing the words to ' Jealousy ' and ' The Dream of Olwen ' and an author of several books dealing with  Christianity  and practical  psychology .           Contents       1   Early life   2   Musical career   3   Popular poet   4   Personal life   5   Selected bibliography   6   References               [ edit ]   Early life   Born in  Catford ,  London , she was the second daughter of Alfred and Nell May. Her older sister was called Connie and her younger brother was always referred to as 'Boy'. In her early life Winifred attended  Sunday School  and was a frequent user of the local library. She and Connie enjoyed reading and poetry, and at night they would spend many hours reciting poems to each other. The family spent many happy holidays at  Brighton  and later in her life Winifred moved to the country and was inspired by the natural cycles of nature which figure in many of her poems.   The May family regularly attended the music hall and their house was often filled with singing and whistling. Winifred showed an early aptitude for the piano and showed enough ability to regularly accompany local amateur singing groups. Following a period at Cusacks College where she took a secretarial course she found employment in a patent agency. It was about this time that she started submitting poems for publication. Her first poem earned her 1  guinea  and it appeared in  Nashs  magazine in 1922. This was followed by other poems appearing in  The Strand  and  Good Housekeeping .     [ edit ]   Musical career   Her musical talent led to her being engaged by 'The Manor Mount Club' in  Forest Hill  where she met the composer Frederick Drummond. He set the words of her 'To Sing Awhile' to music which was then published by  Keith Prowse . Subsequently she was offered full-time employment with the company. At 21 years of age she had more than 100 published songs to her credit, the most famous being ' Jealousy ' which was later recorded by a number of artists including  Hutch ,  Gracie Fields ,  Vera Lynn ,  Richard Tauber  and  Billy Fury . Winifred later claimed to have written the song in fifteen minutes after having the haunting tango tune played to her over the telephone by Lawrence Wright. In 1930 she composed a song for the 4th birthday of Princess Elizabeth (later  Queen Elizabeth II ) which was recorded by  Webster Booth .     [ edit ]   Popular poet   In 1935 she asked  The Daily Mirror  for a regular publication of her poems. The features editor asked her to return the following day with eighteen new poems and a suggested pseudonym. This she did with the pseudonym of Patience Strong, a name she took from a book of the same name by  Adeline T. Whitney  (born 1870). Her daily poems, in The Quiet Corner, continued throughout  World War II  until 1946 when her column was transferred to the  Sunday Pictorial  (later  The Sunday Mirror ) and continued for several decades. She also contributed poems to the weekly magazine  Woman's Own  and latterly to the quarterly magazine,  This England . Her poems were also published in various anthologies and she made two records reciting her poems.     [ edit ]   Personal life   Winifred May married Frederick Arnold Williams, an architect in 1931. They enjoyed a happy but childless marriage until he died in 1965. Two years later she married Guy Cushing, a retired buyer for a departmental store. He pre-deceased her in 1979. Winifred was made a  Freeman  of the  City of London  in 1970. She died at her home in  Sedlescombe ,  Sussex .

clueweb09-enwp01-77-20515	"                     September 1, 1939          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the W. H. Auden poem.  For the actual date, see  1939#September .  For for the invasion on that day in history, see  Invasion of Poland (1939) .   September 1, 1939  is a poem by  W. H. Auden  written on the occasion of the outbreak of  World War II . It was first published in  The New Republic , 18 October  1939 , and was first published in book form in Auden's collection  Another Time  ( 1940 ).           Contents       1   Description   2   History of the text   3   Reception   4   External links               [ edit ]   Description   The poem deliberately echoes the stanza form of  W. B. Yeats 's "" Easter, 1916 "", another poem about an important historical event, and, like Yeats' poem, Auden's moves from a description of historical failures and frustrations to a possible transformation in the present or future.   Until the two final stanzas, the poem briefly describes the social and personal pathology that has brought about the outbreak of war: first the historical development of Germany ""from Luther until now"", next the internal conflicts in every individual person that correspond to the external conflicts of the war. Much of the language and content of the poem echoes that of  C. G. Jung  in his book  Psychology and Religion  (1938).   The final two stanzas shift radically in tone and content, turning to the truth that the poet can tell, ""We must love one another or die,"" and to the presence in the world of ""the Just"" who exchange messages of hope. The poem ends with the hope that the poet, like ""the Just"", can ""show an affirming flame"" in the midst of the disaster.     [ edit ]   History of the text   Auden wrote the poem in the first days of  World War II , while visiting the father of his lover  Chester Kallman  in New Jersey (information provided by Kallman to friends). In a fanciful biography written much later, Dorothy Farnan -- who met Auden three years after the poem was written -- wrote that the poem was written in the Dizzy Club, a jazz bar on  52nd Street  in  New York , but this story is entirely imaginary.   Even before printing the poem for the first time, Auden deleted two stanzas from the latter section, one of them proclaiming his faith in an inevitable ""education of man"" away from war and division. The two stanzas are printed in  Edward Mendelson 's  Early Auden  (1981).   Soon after writing the poem, Auden began to turn away from it, apparently because he found it self-flattering to himself and to his readers. When he reprinted the poem in  The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden  ( 1945 ) he omitted the famous stanza that ends ""We must love one another or die."" In 1957, he wrote to the critic Laurence Lerner, ""Between you and me, I loathe that poem"" (quoted in Edward Mendelson,  Later Auden , p. 478). He resolved to omit it from his further collections (it did not appear in his  1966   Collected Shorter Poems 1927-1957 ).   In the mid-1950s Auden began to refuse permission to editors who asked to reprint the poem in anthologies. In  1955  he allowed  Oscar Williams  to include it complete in  The New Pocket Anthology of American Verse  with the most famous line altered to read ""We must love one another and die."" Later he allowed the poem to be reprinted only once, in a  Penguin Books  anthology  Poetry of the Thirties  ( 1964 ), with a note saying about this and four other early poems, ""Mr. W. H. Auden considers these five poems to be trash which he is ashamed to have written.""     [ edit ]   Reception   Despite Auden's disapproval, the poem became famous and widely popular.  E. M. Forster  wrote ""Because he once wrote 'We must love one another or die' he can command me to follow him"" ( Two Cheers for Democracy , 1951).   A close echo of the line ""We must love one another or die"", spoken by  Lyndon Johnson  in a recording of one of his speeches, was used in the famous Johnson campaign commercial "" Daisy "" during the  1964  campaign. In the ad, the image of a young girl picks petals from a daisy, then is replaced by the image of a nuclear detonation, which serves as an apocalyptic backdrop to the audio of Johnson's speech. Johnson's version of the line, inserted into a speech by an unidentified speechwriter, was  ""We must love each other, or we must die.""   In 2001, immediately after the  September 11, 2001  terrorist attacks, the poem was read (with many lines omitted) on  National Public Radio  and was widely circulated and discussed for its relevance to recent events.

Groups should not be larger than two people.  One person should be ""A"" and the other ""B.""                            Next, explore six types of poetry using the links below.  Write a description of each type on your               Discovering Poetry  worksheet.  Think about ideas that you have for developing each type of poem.                            After writing the descriptions, take a look at some sample poems.  Browse through the provided links.                            Now you become the poet.  Group member ""A"" should write a haiku, limerick, and cinquain poem.  Group member ""B"" should write an acrostic, couplet, and tanka poem.                            Before handing in your poems, work with your group member to create a creative anthology.  You may use Microsoft Publisher or Power Point.  Be             creative and prepared to share your anthology with the class.                            Look at rubric before beginning so that you know how your work will be graded.  Don't forget to check out the extra credit section.                                                                             Process       Part 1 Let's begin exploring various types of poetry.     Read about the  haiku,    and write a short definition on your  Discovering   Poet ry    worksheet.  Right click on Discovering Poetry and select ""save   target as.""  Save to your student ID number.  Type your answers   on your worksheet so that you can print out your final copy.

Using the  Become a   Poet  handout, start developing your poems.  Remember that   group   member ""A"" should write a haiku, limerick, and cinquain poem; group   member ""B"" should write an acrostic, couplet, and tanka poem.    Right click on Become a Poet and select ""save target as.""  Save   to your student ID number.  Type your answers on your worksheet so that   you can print out your final copy.  Feel free to compose your poems on   loose leaf paper before typing your final copies.  **Check out the extra   credit available below**      If you have questions, please see me.  I   am available for help with ideas and editing (mechanics will be   scored).

Fluctuation in the volume and inflection of student's voice are       used for emphasis and to maintain the audience's interest.                                    Quick recovery from minor mistakes, fairly consistent use of direct eye       contact with audience and a satisfactory variation of volume and       inflection.                                    Student shows some tension, occasional but sustained eye contact with       audience. Student attempts to maintain appropriate volume and inflection.                                    Student shows indifference, occasional and unsustained eye contact with       audience. Student's volume is uneven with little or no inflection.                                    Student makes no effort to make eye contact with audience. Low volume       and/or monotonous tone cause audience to disengage.                                         Anthology       contains all of the required poems                                    All of the required poems are included. Final poems are presented on       separate pieces of paper and are appropriately illustrated.                                    Almost all (about 90%) of the required poems are included. Final poems are       presented on separate pieces of paper and are appropriately illustrated.                                    Most (about 75%) of the required poems are included. The student has       included final poems on separate pieces of paper and are appropriately illustrated, though not all of the components have been submitted.                                    Student has submitted some of the required poems, the anthology shows some       evidence of the compilation process as either final copies or revised       poems.                                    Student submits little if any of the required poems (example:       brainstorming done in class that has not been drawn into any further       context).                                         Overall       quality of the poems                                    Poems display originality and make use of many creative details and/or       descriptions that contribute to the reader's enjoyment and understanding.       Poems exhibit a careful probing of the topics they examine. Poet takes       compositional risks.                                     Poems display originality make use of a few creative details and/or       descriptions that contribute to the reader's understanding and enjoyment.       Poet shows some careful consideration of topics and an attempt towards       compositional risks.                                     Poems present a degree of originality and make use of a few creative       details and/or descriptions, but become detracting from poet's message, or       the message of the poet is unclear. Little, if any, attempt has been made       towards compositional risks.                                    Poet shows inattentiveness to the pursuit of originality. Poems details       and descriptions, if present, lack creativity. Poet makes little attempt       to establish clear images and ideas for reader.                                    Poems lack the mark of originality through description and detail.                                         Poems       were carefully edited                                     All poems show thoughtful revision that expresses a response to workshops,       teacher conferencing and self evaluation.                                    All poems show revision from originals, though few show a clear attempt to       respond to feedback received in workshops, teacher conferences and self       evaluation.                                    Most poems are revised, and may show careful thought and response to       workshops, teacher conferences and self evaluation.                                    Few poems are revised, showing no attempt to respond to in-class       workshops, teacher conferences or self evaluation                                    Original poems are presented without showing revision                                         Active       participation and preparation for poetry workshops                                    Always provides thoughtful feedback and stays on task during project.

Shirer       Country   United States       Language   English       Genre(s)   History ,  Nonfiction       Publisher   Simon & Schuster       Publication date   1960       Media type   Print ( Hardcover  and  Paperback )       Pages   1,245       ISBN   ISBN 0-671-72868-7  (1990 paperback)       The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich , by  journalist   William L. Shirer , is the first definitive history of  Nazi Germany  in  English .   Shirer, an  American   radio  reporter for  CBS  who also worked for a number of newspapers and  United Press International , covered  Germany  for many years, until December 1940, when increasing  Nazi  censorship of his broadcasts made his work impossible. This 1,245-page book, first published, in 1960, by  Simon & Schuster, Inc. , and still in print, colors its historically accurate information with denunciation of Nazism and tyranny.   The book is based mostly on the captured documents of the  Third Reich , including the diaries of propaganda minister  Joseph Goebbels  and General  Franz Halder . Additional major sources include testimony and evidence from the  Nuremberg trials ; British Foreign Office reports; and the detailed diary of  Ciano , who was  Benito Mussolini 's son-in-law and the  Italian  Foreign Minister. Other sources include confidential speeches, conference reports, transcripts of telephone conversations, and Shirer's personal recollections of his six years spent reporting on the Third Reich as a journalist.   When the book was written, only a part of the  Goebbels  diaries was known. Other documents have since been discovered, and many documents have become available from  Russia  since the fall of the  Soviet Union .   The book was  adapted  into a  television program  for the  ABC  network in 1966. It was one of the first programs to be marketed as a  miniseries .   The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich  received the  National Book Award  for nonfiction in 1961.

[ 1 ]  Shirer argued for the view that German history proceeded logically from ""Luther to Hitler"" [ 2 ] , seeing Hitler's rise to power as an expression of German character, rather than of the international phenomenon of  totalitarianism . [ 3 ]  Shirer encapsulated this view with the passage, ""...the course of German history... made blind obedience to temporal rulers the highest virtue of Germanic man and put a premium on servility."" [ 4 ]  This point of view (known as the  Sonderweg  thesis to historians) was widespread in the United States at the time, but critics of the book generally considered this interpretation of  Nazism  to be its worst flaw. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Success and acclaim   Upon publication, the book quickly reached the US bestseller list, and remained there for over a year, selling over a million hardback copies (two thirds through the  Book of the Month Club ) and then over a million paperback copies. In addition, it was condensed and serialized by  Reader's Digest  in 1962, thus reaching another 12 million readers. [ 6 ]   Shirer himself was surprised by his book's reception. Neither his agent nor his publisher thought there was much interest in Hitler or Nazi Germany in 1960; only 12,500 copies were made in the first printing.  Rise and Fall  also did well in Britain, France and Italy. [ 7 ]  It also sold well in West Germany, although there, its fame and success were due to a long stream of editorial attacks. [ 8 ]   The book was widely hailed as a great work of history. [ 9 ]  It won the  National Book Award  and the Carey-Thomas Award in 1961. [ 10 ]  In the  New York Times Book Review ,  Hugh Trevor-Roper  praised the book as ""a splendid work of scholarship, objective in method, sound in judgment, inescapable in its conclusions."" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism   Whereas nearly all American journalists praised the book, academics were split. Some of these acknowledged Shirer's achievement, but most condemned it. [ 10 ]  The harshest criticism tended to come from those who disagreed with the  Sonderweg  or ""Luther to Hitler"" thesis mentioned above.   Klaus Epstein listed ""four major failings"": a crude understanding of German history; a lack of balance, leaving important gaps; no understanding of a modern totalitarian regime; and ignorance of current scholarship of the Nazi period. [ 9 ]   Elizabeth Wiskemann  stated in a 1961 review that the book was ""not sufficiently scholarly nor sufficiently well written to satisfy more academic demands ... It is too long and cumbersome... Mr Shirer, has, however compiled a manual ... which will certainly prove useful."" [ 12 ]   William O. Shanahan  in 1962 wrote that ""Shirer's history of the Third Reich is woefully inadequate. Shirer's monumental narrative does not rise above the most commonplace level of understanding. The inadequacies of Shirer's account could be dismissed...if his book had not found an enormous audience. Shirer's [writing] facility.. does not compensate for this book's essential weakness as history."" [ 13 ] .   Richard J. Evans  concedes that  Rise and Fall  is a ""readable general history of Nazi Germany"". His issue with Shirer is that he worked outside of the academic mainstream, and that his research was not informed by the historical scholarship and academic fashions of the time (1960). [ 14 ]   While it is criticized for not being academic enough for purposes of academic research, the text does include extensive references and footnotes. The book also includes several speculations (clearly marked as such), such as a footnote that theorizes that  Heinrich Mller , an  SS  chieftain, later went to serve in the  NKVD , for which Shirer had no evidence.   Karl A. Wittfogel  wrote to the West German publisher of  Rise and Fall :     I view the book as very damaging, politically, and as intellectually ... contemptible. How, more than fifteen years after the fall of Hitler, does one want to explain National Socialism for us by claiming that there are good and bad peoples -- the bad people, this time, not the Jews, but the Germans? The attempt to promote a ... rational, scientific, serious analysis of Fascism (as a part of totalitarian power) has been seriously harmed by his pathetic work. [ 15 ]     In  West Germany , the ""Luther to Hitler"" interpretation was almost universally rejected in favor of the view that Nazism was an instance of totalitarianism, which arises in various countries.  Rise and Fall  was unanimously condemned, and considered dangerous to relations between America and West Germany, as it could inflame anti-German sentiments in the US [ 16 ] .
