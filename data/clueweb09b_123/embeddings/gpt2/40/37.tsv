This receptor has been suggested to be important for the metabolism of apoprotein-E-containing triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, such as  very-low-density-lipoprotein  (VLDL), beta-migrating VLDL and intermediate-density lipoprotein. It is also one of the receptors of  reelin , an extracellular matrix protein which regulates the processes of neuronal migration and  synaptic plasticity .           Contents       1   Distribution in the organism   2   Role in pathology   3   References   4   Sources               [ edit ]   Distribution in the organism   In rabbits, the mRNA for the VLDLR was found to be most abundant in heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, but was not detectable in the liver. Human mRNA studies showed a very similar pattern of distribution. Hence, it has been suggested that the VLDLR might play an important role in the fatty acid metabolism of non-hepatic tissues.     [ edit ]   Role in pathology   A rare neurological disorder first described in the 1970s under the name ""Disequilibrium syndrome"" is now considered to be caused by the disruption of VLDLR gene. [ 1 ]  The disorder was renamed  VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia  (VLDLRCH) after a 2005 study. [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  It is associated with parental consanguinity and found in secluded communities such as the  Hutterites . VLDLRCH is one of the two known genetic disorders caused by a disruption of  reelin  signaling pathway, along with  Norman-Roberts syndrome .

A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally. [ 2 ]           Contents       1   Classification     1.1   Structural classification   1.2   Functional classification   1.3   Biomechanical classification   1.4   Anatomical       2   Arthritis   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Classification          Depiction of an intervertebral disk, a cartilaginous joint.              Diagram of a synovial (diarthrosis) joint.       Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.   Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis       Main article:  Arthritis       Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

It arises from a qualitative or quantitative deficiency of  von Willebrand factor  (vWF), a  multimeric  protein that is required for  platelet  adhesion. It is known to affect humans and dogs. There are four types of  hereditary  vWD. Other factors including ABO blood groups may also play a part in the severity of the condition.

Women may experience  heavy menstrual periods  and blood loss during  childbirth .   Severe  internal  or  joint bleeding  is rare (which only occurs in type 3 vWD).     [ edit ]   Diagnosis   When suspected,  blood plasma  of a patient needs to be investigated for quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of vWF. This is achieved by measuring the amount of vWF in a vWF antigen assay and the functionality of vWF with a  glycoprotein  (GP)Ib binding assay, a  collagen  binding assay or, a  ristocetin  cofactor  activity (RiCof) or  ristocetin induced platelet agglutination  (RIPA) assays.  Factor VIII  levels are also performed because factor VIII is bound to vWF which protects the factor VIII from rapid breakdown within the blood. Deficiency of vWF can therefore lead to a reduction in factor VIII levels. Normal levels do not exclude all forms of vWD: particularly type 2 which may only be revealed by investigating platelet interaction with subendothelium under flow (PAF), a highly specialized coagulation study not routinely performed in most  medical laboratories . A platelet aggregation assay will show an abnormal response to ristocetin with normal responses to the other agonists used. A  platelet function assay  (PFA) will give an abnormal collagen/ adrenaline  closure time and in most cases (but not all) a normal collagen/ ADP  time. Type 2N can only be diagnosed by performing a ""factor VIII binding"" assay. Detection of vWD is complicated by vWF being an  acute phase reactant  with levels rising in  infection ,  pregnancy  and  stress .   Other tests performed in any patient with bleeding problems are a  complete blood count  (especially  platelet  counts),  APTT  (activated partial thromboplastin time),  prothrombin time ,  thrombin  time and  fibrinogen  level. Testing for  factor IX  may also be performed if  hemophilia B  is suspected. Other  coagulation factor  assays may be performed depending on the results of a coagulation screen. Patients with Von Willebrand disease will typically display a normal prothrombin time and a variable prolongation of partial thromboplastin time.     [ edit ]   Classification and types     [ edit ]   Classification   There are four hereditary types of vWD described - type 1, type 2, type 3, and platelet-type. There are inherited and acquired forms of vWD. Most cases are hereditary, but  acquired  forms of vWD have been described. The  International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 's (ISTH) classification depends on the definition of qualitative and quantitative defects. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Type 1   Type 1 vWD (60-80% of all vWD cases) is a quantitative defect (heterozygous for the defective gene) but may not have clearly impaired  clotting , most patients usually end up leading a nearly normal life. Trouble may arise in the form of bleeding following surgery (including dental procedures), noticeable easy bruising, or  menorrhagia  (heavy  periods ). Decreased levels of vWF are detected (10-45% of normal, i.e. 10-45 IU).     [ edit ]   Type 2   Type 2 vWD (20-30%) is a qualitative defect and the bleeding tendency can vary between individuals. There are normal levels of vWF, but the multimers are structurally abnormal, or subgroups of large or small multimers are absent. Four subtypes exist: 2A, 2B, 2M and 2N.     [ edit ]   Type 2A   This is an abnormality of the synthesis or proteolysis of the vWF multimers resulting in the presence of small multimer units in circulation. Factor VIII binding is normal. It has a disproportionately low ristocetin co-factor activity compared to the von Willebrand's antigen.     [ edit ]   Type 2B   This is a ""gain of function"" defect leading to spontaneous binding to platelets and subsequent rapid clearance of the platelets and the large vWF multimers. A mild  thrombocytopenia  may occur. The large vWF multimers are absent in the circulation and the factor VIII binding is normal. Like type 2A, the RiCof:vWF antigen assay is low when the patient's platelet-poor plasma is assayed against formalin-fixed, normal donor platelets. However, when the assay is performed with the patient's own platelets (""platelet-rich plasma""), a lower-than-normal amount of ristocetin causes aggregation to occur. This is due to the large vWF multimers remaining bound to the patient's platelets. Patients with this sub-type are unable to use desmopressin as a treatment for bleeding, because it can lead to unwanted platelet aggregation.     [ edit ]   Type 2M   This is caused by decreased or absent binding to GPIb on the platelets. Factor VIII binding is normal.     [ edit ]   Type 2N (Normandy)   This is a deficiency of the binding of vWF to factor VIII. This type gives a normal vWF antigen level and normal functional test results but has a low factor VIII. This has probably led to some 2N patients being misdiagnosed in the past as having hemophilia A, and should be suspected if the patient has the clinical findings of  hemophilia A  but a pedigree suggesting autosomal, rather than X-linked, inheritance.     [ edit ]   Type 3   Type 3 is the most severe form of vWD (homozygous for the defective gene) and may have severe  mucosal bleeding , no detectable  vWF antigen , and may have sufficiently low  factor VIII  that they have occasional  hemarthroses  (joint bleeding), as in cases of mild  hemophilia .   Platelet-type (also known as pseudo-vWD or platelet-type (pseudo) vWD) Platelet-type vWD is an autosomal dominant type of vWD caused by gain of function mutations of the vWF receptor on platelets; specifically, the alpha chain of the glycoprotein Ib receptor ( GPIb ). This protein is part of the larger complex (GPIb/V/IX) which forms the full vWF receptor on platelets. The ristocetin activity and loss of large vWF multimers is similar to type 2B, but genetic testing of VWF will reveal no mutations.     [ edit ]   Acquired von Willebrand disease   Acquired vWD can occur in patients with  autoantibodies . In this case the function of vWF is not inhibited but the vWF-antibody complex is rapidly cleared from the circulation.   A form of vWD occurs in patients with  aortic valve stenosis , leading to  gastrointestinal bleeding  ( Heyde's syndrome ). This form of acquired vWD may be more prevalent than is presently thought.   Acquired vWF has also been described in the following disorders:  Wilms' tumour ,  hypothyroidism  and  mesenchymal dysplasias .     [ edit ]   Pathophysiology   For the normal function of the coagulation factor, see  von Willebrand factor .   vWF is mainly active in conditions of high blood flow and  shear stress . Deficiency of vWF therefore shows primarily in organs with extensive small vessels, such as the skin, the  gastrointestinal tract  and the  uterus . In  angiodysplasia , a form of  telangiectasia  of the  colon , shear stress is much higher than in average  capillaries , and the risk of bleeding is increased concomitantly.   In more severe cases of type 1 vWD, genetic changes are common within the vWF gene and are highly  penetrant . In milder cases of type 1 vWD there may be a complex spectrum of molecular  pathology  in addition to  polymorphisms  of the vWF gene alone. [ 2 ]  The individual's  ABO blood group  can influence presentation and pathology of vWD. Those individuals with blood group O have a lower mean level than individuals with other blood groups. Unless ABO groupspecific vWF:antigen reference ranges are used, normal group O individuals can be diagnosed as type I vWD, and some individuals of blood group AB with a genetic defect of vWF may have the diagnosis overlooked because vWF levels are elevated due to blood group. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Genetics          von Willebrand disease types I and II are inherited in an  autosomal dominant  pattern.              von Willebrand disease type III (and sometimes II) is inherited in an  autosomal recessive  pattern.       The vWF gene is located on  chromosome twelve  (12p13.2). It has 52 exons spanning 178kbp. Types 1 and 2 are inherited as  autosomal dominant  traits and type 3 is inherited as  autosomal recessive . Occasionally type 2 also inherits recessively.     [ edit ]   Epidemiology   The  prevalence  of vWD is about 1 in 100 individuals. [ 4 ]  However the majority of these people do not have symptoms. The prevalence of clinically significant cases is 100 per million. [ 4 ]  Because most forms are rather mild, they are detected more often in women, whose bleeding tendency shows during  menstruation . It may be more severe or apparent in people with  blood type  O.     [ edit ]   Therapy   Patients with vWD normally require no regular treatment, although they are always at increased risk for bleeding. For women with heavy menstrual bleeding, the  combined oral contraceptive pill  may be effective in reducing bleeding or in reducing the length or frequency of periods. Prophylactic treatment is sometimes given for patients with vWD who are scheduled for surgery. They can be treated with human derived medium purity  factor VIII  concentrates complexed to vWF(antihemophilic factor, more commonly known as  Humate-P ) Mild cases of vWD can be trialled on  desmopressin  (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, DDAVP) (desmopressin acetate,  Stimate ), which works by raising the patient's own plasma levels of vWF by inducing release of vWF stored in the  Weibel-Palade bodies  in the endothelial cells.

Human iron metabolism  is the set of chemical reactions maintaining  human homeostasis  of  iron . Iron is an essential element for most life on Earth, including  human beings . The control of this necessary but potentially  toxic  substance is an important part of many aspects of human  health  and  disease .  Hematologists  have been especially interested in the system of iron  metabolism  because iron is essential to  red blood cells . Most of the  human body 's iron is contained in red blood cells'  hemoglobin , and  iron deficiency anemia  is the most common type of  anemia .   Understanding this system is also important for understanding diseases of  iron overload , like  hemochromatosis .   Recent discoveries in the field have shed new light on how humans control the level of iron in their bodies and created new understanding of the mechanisms of several diseases.

Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of life, including humans and most  bacterial  species. Because  plants  and  animals  all use iron, iron can be found in a wide variety of food sources.   Iron is essential to life, because of its unique ability to serve as both an  electron donor  and  acceptor .   Iron can also be potentially toxic. Its ability to donate and accept electrons means that if iron is free within the cell, it can  catalyze  the conversion of  hydrogen peroxide  into  free radicals . Free radicals can cause damage to a wide variety of cellular structures, and ultimately kill the cell. To prevent that kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to  proteins . That allows the cells to use the benefits of iron, but also limit its ability to do harm.  [1]   The most important group of iron-binding proteins contain the  heme  molecules, all of which contain iron at their centers. Humans and most bacteria use variants of  heme  to carry out  redox  reactions and  electron transport  processes. These reactions and processes are required for  oxidative phosphorylation . That process is the principal source of energy for human cells; without it, our cells would die.   The  iron-sulfur proteins  are another important group of iron-containing proteins. Some of these proteins are also essential parts of oxidative phosphorylation.   Humans also use iron in the  hemoglobin  of  red blood cells , in order to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to export carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Iron is also an essential component of  myoglobin  to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.   The human body needs iron for oxygen transport. That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.  [2]     [ edit ]   Bacterial protection   A proper iron metabolism protects against  bacterial infection . If bacteria are to survive, then they must get iron from the environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called  siderophores  and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a  metabolic price  they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against bacterial infection. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces  hepcidin  in response to inflammatory  cytokines , hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease , in which not enough iron is available to produce enough  hemoglobin -containing red blood cells.  [4]     [ edit ]   Body iron stores          1918 illustration of blood cell production in the  bone marrow . In iron deficiency, the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells, and as the deficiency gets worse, the cells become smaller.       Most well-nourished people in industrialized countries have 3-4 grams of iron in their bodies. Of this, about 2.5 g is contained in the hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen through the blood. Another 400 mg is devoted to cellular proteins that use iron for important cellular processes like storing oxygen ( myoglobin ), or performing energy-producing  redox  reactions ( cytochromes ). 3-4 mg circulates through the  plasma , bound to  transferrin .  [5]   Since so much iron is required for hemoglobin,  iron deficiency anemia  is the first and primary clinical manifestation of  iron deficiency . Oxygen transport is so important to human life that severe anemia harms or kills people by depriving their organs of enough oxygen. Iron-deficient people will suffer or die from organ damage well before cells run out of the iron needed for intracellular processes like electron transport.   Some iron in the body is stored. Physiologically, most stored iron is bound by  ferritin  molecules; the largest amount of ferritin-bound iron is found in cells of the liver  hepatocytes , the  bone marrow  and the  spleen . The liver's stores of ferritin are the primary physiologic source of reserve iron in the body.   Macrophages  of the  reticuloendothelial system  store iron as part of the process of breaking down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed  red blood cells .   Iron is also stored as a pigment called  hemosiderin  in an apparently pathologic process. This molecule appears to be mainly the result of cell damage. It is often found engulfed by  macrophages  that are scavenging regions of damage. It can also be found among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions.   Men tend to have more stored iron than women, particularly women who must use their stores to compensate for iron lost through  menstruation ,  pregnancy  or  lactation .     [ edit ]   How the body gets its iron   Most of the iron in the body is hoarded and recycled by the  reticuloendothelial system  which breaks down aged  red blood cells . However, people lose a small but steady amount by  sweating  and by shedding cells of the  skin  and the  mucosal  lining of the  gastrointestinal tract . The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of 1 mg a day for men, and 1.52 mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron. They do so via a tightly regulated process that under normal circumstances protects against iron overload.     [ edit ]   Absorbing iron from the diet          Meat contains heme, which is a source of iron.       Like most mineral nutrients, iron from digested food or supplements is almost entirely absorbed in the  duodenum  by  enterocytes  of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body.   To be absorbed, dietary iron must be in its ferrous Fe 2+  form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes'  brush border ,  Dcytb , reduces ferric Fe 3+  to Fe 2+ . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1  DMT1 , which transports all kinds of  divalent  metals into the body, then transports the iron across the enterocyte's  cell membrane  and into the cell.   These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into  feces ) or the cell can move it into the body, using a protein called  ferroportin . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, cells produce more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to  iron deficiency anemia .  [7]   Our bodies' rates of iron absorption appear to respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, the extent to which the  bone marrow  is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. We also absorb less iron during times of  inflammation . Recent discoveries demonstrate that  hepcidin  regulation of ferroportin (see below) is responsible for the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease .   While Dcytb and DMT1 are unique to iron transport across the duodenum,  ferroportin  is distributed throughout the body on all cells which store iron. Thus, regulation of  ferroportin  is the body's main way of regulating the amount of iron in circulation.   Hephaestin , a  ferroxidase  that which can oxidize Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps  ferroportin  transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells.     [ edit ]   Reasons for iron deficiency          Iron is an important topic in  prenatal care  because women can sometimes become iron-deficient from the increased iron demands of pregnancy.       Functional or actual  iron deficiency  can result from a variety of causes, explained in more detail in the article dedicated to this topic. These causes can be grouped into several categories:     Increased demand for iron, which the diet cannot accommodate.   Increased loss of iron (usually through loss of blood).   Nutritional deficiency. This can either be the result of failure to eat iron-containing foods, or eating a diet heavy in food that reduces the absorption of iron, or both.   Inability to absorb iron because of damage to the intestinal lining. Examples of causes of this kind of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like  Crohn's  or  celiac sprue  which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.   Inflammation leading to  hepcidin -induced restriction on iron release from enterocytes (see below).       [ edit ]   The possibility of too much iron   The body is able to substantially reduce the amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not seem to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of  iron intoxication . Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the  liver , the  heart  and other metabolically active organs.   Iron toxicity results when the amount of circulating iron exceeds the amount of  transferrin  available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet overdose [8]  rather than variations in  diet . Iron toxicity is usually the result of more chronic  iron overload  syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes.     [ edit ]   How cells get their iron from the body       Main article:  Iron-responsive element binding protein       As discussed above, most of the iron in the body is located on hemoglobin molecules of red blood cells. When red blood cells reach a certain age, they are degraded and engulfed by specialized scavenging  macrophages . These cells internalize the iron-containing hemoglobin, degrade it, put the iron onto transferrin molecules, and then export the transferrin-iron complexes back out into the blood. Most of the iron used for blood cell production comes from this cycle of hemoglobin recycling.   All cells use some iron, and must get it from the circulating  blood . Since iron is tightly bound to transferrin, cells throughout the body have receptors for transferrin-iron complexes on their surfaces. These receptors  engulf and internalize  both the protein and the iron attached to it. Once inside, the cell transfers the iron to  ferritin , the internal iron storage molecule.   Transferrin receptor production will increase, and ferritin production will decrease.  [9]     [ edit ]   Regulation by location   In summary, regulation of iron levels is a task of the whole body, as well as for individual cells.   When  body  levels of iron are too low, then  hepcidin  in the  duodenal epithelium  is decreased. This causes an increase in  ferroportin  activity, stimulating iron uptake in the  digestive system . Vice versa in iron surplus.   In  individual cells , an iron deficiency causes  responsive element binding protein  to  iron responsive elements  on mRNAs for  transferrin receptors , resulting in increased production of transferrin receptors. These receptors increase binding of  transferrin  to cells, and therefore stimulating iron uptake.          Electron micrograph of  E. coli . All bacteria that cause human disease require iron to live and to multiply.         [ edit ]   Diseases of iron regulation       Main article:  Iron metabolism disorder       The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic  iron overload  disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.

Human iron metabolism  is the set of chemical reactions maintaining  human homeostasis  of  iron . Iron is an essential element for most life on Earth, including  human beings . The control of this necessary but potentially  toxic  substance is an important part of many aspects of human  health  and  disease .  Hematologists  have been especially interested in the system of iron  metabolism  because iron is essential to  red blood cells . Most of the  human body 's iron is contained in red blood cells'  hemoglobin , and  iron deficiency anemia  is the most common type of  anemia .   Understanding this system is also important for understanding diseases of  iron overload , like  hemochromatosis .   Recent discoveries in the field have shed new light on how humans control the level of iron in their bodies and created new understanding of the mechanisms of several diseases.

Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of life, including humans and most  bacterial  species. Because  plants  and  animals  all use iron, iron can be found in a wide variety of food sources.   Iron is essential to life, because of its unique ability to serve as both an  electron donor  and  acceptor .   Iron can also be potentially toxic. Its ability to donate and accept electrons means that if iron is free within the cell, it can  catalyze  the conversion of  hydrogen peroxide  into  free radicals . Free radicals can cause damage to a wide variety of cellular structures, and ultimately kill the cell. To prevent that kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to  proteins . That allows the cells to use the benefits of iron, but also limit its ability to do harm.  [1]   The most important group of iron-binding proteins contain the  heme  molecules, all of which contain iron at their centers. Humans and most bacteria use variants of  heme  to carry out  redox  reactions and  electron transport  processes. These reactions and processes are required for  oxidative phosphorylation . That process is the principal source of energy for human cells; without it, our cells would die.   The  iron-sulfur proteins  are another important group of iron-containing proteins. Some of these proteins are also essential parts of oxidative phosphorylation.   Humans also use iron in the  hemoglobin  of  red blood cells , in order to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to export carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Iron is also an essential component of  myoglobin  to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.   The human body needs iron for oxygen transport. That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.  [2]     [ edit ]   Bacterial protection   A proper iron metabolism protects against  bacterial infection . If bacteria are to survive, then they must get iron from the environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called  siderophores  and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a  metabolic price  they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against bacterial infection. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces  hepcidin  in response to inflammatory  cytokines , hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease , in which not enough iron is available to produce enough  hemoglobin -containing red blood cells.  [4]     [ edit ]   Body iron stores          1918 illustration of blood cell production in the  bone marrow . In iron deficiency, the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells, and as the deficiency gets worse, the cells become smaller.       Most well-nourished people in industrialized countries have 3-4 grams of iron in their bodies. Of this, about 2.5 g is contained in the hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen through the blood. Another 400 mg is devoted to cellular proteins that use iron for important cellular processes like storing oxygen ( myoglobin ), or performing energy-producing  redox  reactions ( cytochromes ). 3-4 mg circulates through the  plasma , bound to  transferrin .  [5]   Since so much iron is required for hemoglobin,  iron deficiency anemia  is the first and primary clinical manifestation of  iron deficiency . Oxygen transport is so important to human life that severe anemia harms or kills people by depriving their organs of enough oxygen. Iron-deficient people will suffer or die from organ damage well before cells run out of the iron needed for intracellular processes like electron transport.   Some iron in the body is stored. Physiologically, most stored iron is bound by  ferritin  molecules; the largest amount of ferritin-bound iron is found in cells of the liver  hepatocytes , the  bone marrow  and the  spleen . The liver's stores of ferritin are the primary physiologic source of reserve iron in the body.   Macrophages  of the  reticuloendothelial system  store iron as part of the process of breaking down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed  red blood cells .   Iron is also stored as a pigment called  hemosiderin  in an apparently pathologic process. This molecule appears to be mainly the result of cell damage. It is often found engulfed by  macrophages  that are scavenging regions of damage. It can also be found among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions.   Men tend to have more stored iron than women, particularly women who must use their stores to compensate for iron lost through  menstruation ,  pregnancy  or  lactation .     [ edit ]   How the body gets its iron   Most of the iron in the body is hoarded and recycled by the  reticuloendothelial system  which breaks down aged  red blood cells . However, people lose a small but steady amount by  sweating  and by shedding cells of the  skin  and the  mucosal  lining of the  gastrointestinal tract . The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of 1 mg a day for men, and 1.52 mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron. They do so via a tightly regulated process that under normal circumstances protects against iron overload.     [ edit ]   Absorbing iron from the diet          Meat contains heme, which is a source of iron.       Like most mineral nutrients, iron from digested food or supplements is almost entirely absorbed in the  duodenum  by  enterocytes  of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body.   To be absorbed, dietary iron must be in its ferrous Fe 2+  form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes'  brush border ,  Dcytb , reduces ferric Fe 3+  to Fe 2+ . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1  DMT1 , which transports all kinds of  divalent  metals into the body, then transports the iron across the enterocyte's  cell membrane  and into the cell.   These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into  feces ) or the cell can move it into the body, using a protein called  ferroportin . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, cells produce more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to  iron deficiency anemia .  [7]   Our bodies' rates of iron absorption appear to respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, the extent to which the  bone marrow  is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. We also absorb less iron during times of  inflammation . Recent discoveries demonstrate that  hepcidin  regulation of ferroportin (see below) is responsible for the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease .   While Dcytb and DMT1 are unique to iron transport across the duodenum,  ferroportin  is distributed throughout the body on all cells which store iron. Thus, regulation of  ferroportin  is the body's main way of regulating the amount of iron in circulation.   Hephaestin , a  ferroxidase  that which can oxidize Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps  ferroportin  transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells.     [ edit ]   Reasons for iron deficiency          Iron is an important topic in  prenatal care  because women can sometimes become iron-deficient from the increased iron demands of pregnancy.       Functional or actual  iron deficiency  can result from a variety of causes, explained in more detail in the article dedicated to this topic. These causes can be grouped into several categories:     Increased demand for iron, which the diet cannot accommodate.   Increased loss of iron (usually through loss of blood).   Nutritional deficiency. This can either be the result of failure to eat iron-containing foods, or eating a diet heavy in food that reduces the absorption of iron, or both.   Inability to absorb iron because of damage to the intestinal lining. Examples of causes of this kind of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like  Crohn's  or  celiac sprue  which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.   Inflammation leading to  hepcidin -induced restriction on iron release from enterocytes (see below).       [ edit ]   The possibility of too much iron   The body is able to substantially reduce the amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not seem to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of  iron intoxication . Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the  liver , the  heart  and other metabolically active organs.   Iron toxicity results when the amount of circulating iron exceeds the amount of  transferrin  available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet overdose [8]  rather than variations in  diet . Iron toxicity is usually the result of more chronic  iron overload  syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes.     [ edit ]   How cells get their iron from the body   Main article:  Iron-responsive element binding protein   As discussed above, most of the iron in the body is located on hemoglobin molecules of red blood cells. When red blood cells reach a certain age, they are degraded and engulfed by specialized scavenging  macrophages . These cells internalize the iron-containing hemoglobin, degrade it, put the iron onto transferrin molecules, and then export the transferrin-iron complexes back out into the blood. Most of the iron used for blood cell production comes from this cycle of hemoglobin recycling.   All cells use some iron, and must get it from the circulating  blood . Since iron is tightly bound to transferrin, cells throughout the body have receptors for transferrin-iron complexes on their surfaces. These receptors  engulf and internalize  both the protein and the iron attached to it. Once inside, the cell transfers the iron to  ferritin , the internal iron storage molecule.   Transferrin receptor production will increase, and ferritin production will decrease.  [9]     [ edit ]   Regulation by location   In summary, regulation of iron levels is a task of the whole body, as well as for individual cells.   When  body  levels of iron are too low, then  hepcidin  in the  duodenal epithelium  is decreased. This causes an increase in  ferroportin  activity, stimulating iron uptake in the  digestive system . Vice versa in iron surplus.   In  individual cells , an iron deficiency causes  responsive element binding protein  to  iron responsive elements  on mRNAs for  transferrin receptors , resulting in increased production of transferrin receptors. These receptors increase binding of  transferrin  to cells, and therefore stimulating iron uptake.          Electron micrograph of  E. coli . All bacteria that cause human disease require iron to live and to multiply.         [ edit ]   Diseases of iron regulation   Main article:  Iron metabolism disorder   The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic  iron overload  disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.

Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of life, including humans and most  bacterial  species. Because  plants  and  animals  all use iron, iron can be found in a wide variety of food sources.   Iron is essential to life, because of its unique ability to serve as both an  electron donor  and  acceptor .   Iron can also be potentially toxic. Its ability to donate and accept electrons means that if iron is free within the cell, it can  catalyze  the conversion of  hydrogen peroxide  into  free radicals . Free radicals can cause damage to a wide variety of cellular structures, and ultimately kill the cell. To prevent that kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to  proteins . That allows the cells to use the benefits of iron, but also limit its ability to do harm.  [1]   The most important group of iron-binding proteins contain the  heme  molecules, all of which contain iron at their centers. Humans and most bacteria use variants of  heme  to carry out  redox  reactions and  electron transport  processes. These reactions and processes are required for  oxidative phosphorylation . That process is the principal source of energy for human cells; without it, our cells would die.   The  iron-sulfur proteins  are another important group of iron-containing proteins. Some of these proteins are also essential parts of oxidative phosphorylation.   Humans also use iron in the  hemoglobin  of  red blood cells , in order to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to export carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Iron is also an essential component of  myoglobin  to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.   The human body needs iron for oxygen transport. That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.  [2]     [ edit ]   Bacterial protection   A proper iron metabolism protects against  bacterial infection . If bacteria are to survive, then they must get iron from the environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called  siderophores  and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a  metabolic price  they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against bacterial infection. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces  hepcidin  in response to inflammatory  cytokines , hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease , in which not enough iron is available to produce enough  hemoglobin -containing red blood cells.  [4]     [ edit ]   Body iron stores          1918 illustration of blood cell production in the  bone marrow . In iron deficiency, the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells, and as the deficiency gets worse, the cells become smaller.       Most well-nourished people in industrialized countries have 3-4 grams of iron in their bodies. Of this, about 2.5 g is contained in the hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen through the blood. Another 400 mg is devoted to cellular proteins that use iron for important cellular processes like storing oxygen ( myoglobin ), or performing energy-producing  redox  reactions ( cytochromes ). 3-4 mg circulates through the  plasma , bound to  transferrin .  [5]   Since so much iron is required for hemoglobin,  iron deficiency anemia  is the first and primary clinical manifestation of  iron deficiency . Oxygen transport is so important to human life that severe anemia harms or kills people by depriving their organs of enough oxygen. Iron-deficient people will suffer or die from organ damage well before cells run out of the iron needed for intracellular processes like electron transport.   Some iron in the body is stored. Physiologically, most stored iron is bound by  ferritin  molecules; the largest amount of ferritin-bound iron is found in cells of the liver  hepatocytes , the  bone marrow  and the  spleen . The liver's stores of ferritin are the primary physiologic source of reserve iron in the body.   Macrophages  of the  reticuloendothelial system  store iron as part of the process of breaking down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed  red blood cells .   Iron is also stored as a pigment called  hemosiderin  in an apparently pathologic process. This molecule appears to be mainly the result of cell damage. It is often found engulfed by  macrophages  that are scavenging regions of damage. It can also be found among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions.   Men tend to have more stored iron than women, particularly women who must use their stores to compensate for iron lost through  menstruation ,  pregnancy  or  lactation .     [ edit ]   How the body gets its iron   Most of the iron in the body is hoarded and recycled by the  reticuloendothelial system  which breaks down aged  red blood cells . However, people lose a small but steady amount by  sweating  and by shedding cells of the  skin  and the  mucosal  lining of the  gastrointestinal tract . The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of 1 mg a day for men, and 1.52 mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron. They do so via a tightly regulated process that under normal circumstances protects against iron overload.     [ edit ]   Absorbing iron from the diet          Meat contains heme, which is a source of iron.       Like most mineral nutrients, iron from digested food or supplements is almost entirely absorbed in the  duodenum  by  enterocytes  of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body.   To be absorbed, dietary iron must be in its ferrous Fe 2+  form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes'  brush border ,  Dcytb , reduces ferric Fe 3+  to Fe 2+ . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1  DMT1 , which transports all kinds of  divalent  metals into the body, then transports the iron across the enterocyte's  cell membrane  and into the cell.   These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into  feces ) or the cell can move it into the body, using a protein called  ferroportin . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, cells produce more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to  iron deficiency anemia .  [7]   Our bodies' rates of iron absorption appear to respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, the extent to which the  bone marrow  is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. We also absorb less iron during times of  inflammation . Recent discoveries demonstrate that  hepcidin  regulation of ferroportin (see below) is responsible for the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease .   While Dcytb and DMT1 are unique to iron transport across the duodenum,  ferroportin  is distributed throughout the body on all cells which store iron. Thus, regulation of  ferroportin  is the body's main way of regulating the amount of iron in circulation.   Hephaestin , a  ferroxidase  that which can oxidize Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps  ferroportin  transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells.     [ edit ]   Reasons for iron deficiency          Iron is an important topic in  prenatal care  because women can sometimes become iron-deficient from the increased iron demands of pregnancy.       Functional or actual  iron deficiency  can result from a variety of causes, explained in more detail in the article dedicated to this topic. These causes can be grouped into several categories:     Increased demand for iron, which the diet cannot accommodate.   Increased loss of iron (usually through loss of blood).   Nutritional deficiency. This can either be the result of failure to eat iron-containing foods, or eating a diet heavy in food that reduces the absorption of iron, or both.   Inability to absorb iron because of damage to the intestinal lining. Examples of causes of this kind of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like  Crohn's  or  celiac sprue  which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.   Inflammation leading to  hepcidin -induced restriction on iron release from enterocytes (see below).       [ edit ]   The possibility of too much iron   The body is able to substantially reduce the amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not seem to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of  iron intoxication . Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the  liver , the  heart  and other metabolically active organs.   Iron toxicity results when the amount of circulating iron exceeds the amount of  transferrin  available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet overdose [8]  rather than variations in  diet . Iron toxicity is usually the result of more chronic  iron overload  syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes.     [ edit ]   How cells get their iron from the body   Main article:  Iron-responsive element binding protein   As discussed above, most of the iron in the body is located on hemoglobin molecules of red blood cells. When red blood cells reach a certain age, they are degraded and engulfed by specialized scavenging  macrophages . These cells internalize the iron-containing hemoglobin, degrade it, put the iron onto transferrin molecules, and then export the transferrin-iron complexes back out into the blood. Most of the iron used for blood cell production comes from this cycle of hemoglobin recycling.   All cells use some iron, and must get it from the circulating  blood . Since iron is tightly bound to transferrin, cells throughout the body have receptors for transferrin-iron complexes on their surfaces. These receptors  engulf and internalize  both the protein and the iron attached to it. Once inside, the cell transfers the iron to  ferritin , the internal iron storage molecule.   Transferrin receptor production will increase, and ferritin production will decrease.  [9]     [ edit ]   Regulation by location   In summary, regulation of iron levels is a task of the whole body, as well as for individual cells.   When  body  levels of iron are too low, then  hepcidin  in the  duodenal epithelium  is decreased. This causes an increase in  ferroportin  activity, stimulating iron uptake in the  digestive system . Vice versa in iron surplus.   In  individual cells , an iron deficiency causes  responsive element binding protein  to  iron responsive elements  on mRNAs for  transferrin receptors , resulting in increased production of transferrin receptors. These receptors increase binding of  transferrin  to cells, and therefore stimulating iron uptake.          Electron micrograph of  E. coli . All bacteria that cause human disease require iron to live and to multiply.         [ edit ]   Diseases of iron regulation   Main article:  Iron metabolism disorder   The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic  iron overload  disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.

That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.  [2]     [ edit ]   Bacterial protection   A proper iron metabolism protects against  bacterial infection . If bacteria are to survive, then they must get iron from the environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called  siderophores  and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a  metabolic price  they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against bacterial infection. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces  hepcidin  in response to inflammatory  cytokines , hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease , in which not enough iron is available to produce enough  hemoglobin -containing red blood cells.  [4]     [ edit ]   Body iron stores          1918 illustration of blood cell production in the  bone marrow . In iron deficiency, the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells, and as the deficiency gets worse, the cells become smaller.       Most well-nourished people in industrialized countries have 3-4 grams of iron in their bodies. Of this, about 2.5 g is contained in the hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen through the blood. Another 400 mg is devoted to cellular proteins that use iron for important cellular processes like storing oxygen ( myoglobin ), or performing energy-producing  redox  reactions ( cytochromes ). 3-4 mg circulates through the  plasma , bound to  transferrin .  [5]   Since so much iron is required for hemoglobin,  iron deficiency anemia  is the first and primary clinical manifestation of  iron deficiency . Oxygen transport is so important to human life that severe anemia harms or kills people by depriving their organs of enough oxygen. Iron-deficient people will suffer or die from organ damage well before cells run out of the iron needed for intracellular processes like electron transport.   Some iron in the body is stored. Physiologically, most stored iron is bound by  ferritin  molecules; the largest amount of ferritin-bound iron is found in cells of the liver  hepatocytes , the  bone marrow  and the  spleen . The liver's stores of ferritin are the primary physiologic source of reserve iron in the body.   Macrophages  of the  reticuloendothelial system  store iron as part of the process of breaking down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed  red blood cells .   Iron is also stored as a pigment called  hemosiderin  in an apparently pathologic process. This molecule appears to be mainly the result of cell damage. It is often found engulfed by  macrophages  that are scavenging regions of damage. It can also be found among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions.   Men tend to have more stored iron than women, particularly women who must use their stores to compensate for iron lost through  menstruation ,  pregnancy  or  lactation .     [ edit ]   How the body gets its iron   Most of the iron in the body is hoarded and recycled by the  reticuloendothelial system  which breaks down aged  red blood cells . However, people lose a small but steady amount by  sweating  and by shedding cells of the  skin  and the  mucosal  lining of the  gastrointestinal tract . The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of 1 mg a day for men, and 1.52 mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron. They do so via a tightly regulated process that under normal circumstances protects against iron overload.     [ edit ]   Absorbing iron from the diet          Meat contains heme, which is a source of iron.       Like most mineral nutrients, iron from digested food or supplements is almost entirely absorbed in the  duodenum  by  enterocytes  of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body.   To be absorbed, dietary iron must be in its ferrous Fe 2+  form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes'  brush border ,  Dcytb , reduces ferric Fe 3+  to Fe 2+ . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1  DMT1 , which transports all kinds of  divalent  metals into the body, then transports the iron across the enterocyte's  cell membrane  and into the cell.   These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into  feces ) or the cell can move it into the body, using a protein called  ferroportin . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, cells produce more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to  iron deficiency anemia .  [7]   Our bodies' rates of iron absorption appear to respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, the extent to which the  bone marrow  is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. We also absorb less iron during times of  inflammation . Recent discoveries demonstrate that  hepcidin  regulation of ferroportin (see below) is responsible for the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease .   While Dcytb and DMT1 are unique to iron transport across the duodenum,  ferroportin  is distributed throughout the body on all cells which store iron. Thus, regulation of  ferroportin  is the body's main way of regulating the amount of iron in circulation.   Hephaestin , a  ferroxidase  that which can oxidize Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps  ferroportin  transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells.     [ edit ]   Reasons for iron deficiency          Iron is an important topic in  prenatal care  because women can sometimes become iron-deficient from the increased iron demands of pregnancy.       Functional or actual  iron deficiency  can result from a variety of causes, explained in more detail in the article dedicated to this topic. These causes can be grouped into several categories:     Increased demand for iron, which the diet cannot accommodate.   Increased loss of iron (usually through loss of blood).   Nutritional deficiency. This can either be the result of failure to eat iron-containing foods, or eating a diet heavy in food that reduces the absorption of iron, or both.   Inability to absorb iron because of damage to the intestinal lining. Examples of causes of this kind of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like  Crohn's  or  celiac sprue  which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.   Inflammation leading to  hepcidin -induced restriction on iron release from enterocytes (see below).       [ edit ]   The possibility of too much iron   The body is able to substantially reduce the amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not seem to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of  iron intoxication . Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the  liver , the  heart  and other metabolically active organs.   Iron toxicity results when the amount of circulating iron exceeds the amount of  transferrin  available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet overdose [8]  rather than variations in  diet . Iron toxicity is usually the result of more chronic  iron overload  syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes.     [ edit ]   How cells get their iron from the body   Main article:  Iron-responsive element binding protein   As discussed above, most of the iron in the body is located on hemoglobin molecules of red blood cells. When red blood cells reach a certain age, they are degraded and engulfed by specialized scavenging  macrophages . These cells internalize the iron-containing hemoglobin, degrade it, put the iron onto transferrin molecules, and then export the transferrin-iron complexes back out into the blood. Most of the iron used for blood cell production comes from this cycle of hemoglobin recycling.   All cells use some iron, and must get it from the circulating  blood . Since iron is tightly bound to transferrin, cells throughout the body have receptors for transferrin-iron complexes on their surfaces. These receptors  engulf and internalize  both the protein and the iron attached to it. Once inside, the cell transfers the iron to  ferritin , the internal iron storage molecule.   Transferrin receptor production will increase, and ferritin production will decrease.  [9]     [ edit ]   Regulation by location   In summary, regulation of iron levels is a task of the whole body, as well as for individual cells.   When  body  levels of iron are too low, then  hepcidin  in the  duodenal epithelium  is decreased. This causes an increase in  ferroportin  activity, stimulating iron uptake in the  digestive system . Vice versa in iron surplus.   In  individual cells , an iron deficiency causes  responsive element binding protein  to  iron responsive elements  on mRNAs for  transferrin receptors , resulting in increased production of transferrin receptors. These receptors increase binding of  transferrin  to cells, and therefore stimulating iron uptake.          Electron micrograph of  E. coli . All bacteria that cause human disease require iron to live and to multiply.         [ edit ]   Diseases of iron regulation   Main article:  Iron metabolism disorder   The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic  iron overload  disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.

Human iron metabolism  is the set of chemical reactions maintaining  human homeostasis  of  iron . Iron is an essential element for most life on Earth, including  human beings . The control of this necessary but potentially  toxic  substance is an important part of many aspects of human  health  and  disease .  Hematologists  have been especially interested in the system of iron  metabolism  because iron is essential to  red blood cells . Most of the  human body 's iron is contained in red blood cells'  hemoglobin , and  iron deficiency anemia  is the most common type of  anemia .   Understanding this system is also important for understanding diseases of  iron overload , like  hemochromatosis .   Recent discoveries in the field have shed new light on how humans control the level of iron in their bodies and created new understanding of the mechanisms of several diseases.

Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of life, including humans and most  bacterial  species. Because  plants  and  animals  all use iron, iron can be found in a wide variety of food sources.   Iron is essential to life, because of its unique ability to serve as both an  electron donor  and  acceptor .   Iron can also be potentially toxic. Its ability to donate and accept electrons means that if iron is free within the cell, it can  catalyze  the conversion of  hydrogen peroxide  into  free radicals . Free radicals can cause damage to a wide variety of cellular structures, and ultimately kill the cell. To prevent that kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to  proteins . That allows the cells to use the benefits of iron, but also limit its ability to do harm.  [1]   The most important group of iron-binding proteins contain the  heme  molecules, all of which contain iron at their centers. Humans and most bacteria use variants of  heme  to carry out  redox  reactions and  electron transport  processes. These reactions and processes are required for  oxidative phosphorylation . That process is the principal source of energy for human cells; without it, our cells would die.   The  iron-sulfur proteins  are another important group of iron-containing proteins. Some of these proteins are also essential parts of oxidative phosphorylation.   Humans also use iron in the  hemoglobin  of  red blood cells , in order to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to export carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Iron is also an essential component of  myoglobin  to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.   The human body needs iron for oxygen transport. That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.

People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer.

People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron.

Human iron metabolism  is the set of chemical reactions maintaining  human homeostasis  of  iron . Iron is an essential element for most life on Earth, including  human beings . The control of this necessary but potentially  toxic  substance is an important part of many aspects of human  health  and  disease .  Hematologists  have been especially interested in the system of iron  metabolism  because iron is essential to  red blood cells . Most of the  human body 's iron is contained in red blood cells'  hemoglobin , and  iron deficiency anemia  is the most common type of  anemia .   Understanding this system is also important for understanding diseases of  iron overload , like  hemochromatosis .   Recent discoveries in the field have shed new light on how humans control the level of iron in their bodies and created new understanding of the mechanisms of several diseases.

Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of life, including humans and most  bacterial  species. Because  plants  and  animals  all use iron, iron can be found in a wide variety of food sources.   Iron is essential to life, because of its unique ability to serve as both an  electron donor  and  acceptor .   Iron can also be potentially toxic. Its ability to donate and accept electrons means that if iron is free within the cell, it can  catalyze  the conversion of  hydrogen peroxide  into  free radicals . Free radicals can cause damage to a wide variety of cellular structures, and ultimately kill the cell. To prevent that kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to  proteins . That allows the cells to use the benefits of iron, but also limit its ability to do harm.  [1]   The most important group of iron-binding proteins contain the  heme  molecules, all of which contain iron at their centers. Humans and most bacteria use variants of  heme  to carry out  redox  reactions and  electron transport  processes. These reactions and processes are required for  oxidative phosphorylation . That process is the principal source of energy for human cells; without it, our cells would die.   The  iron-sulfur proteins  are another important group of iron-containing proteins. Some of these proteins are also essential parts of oxidative phosphorylation.   Humans also use iron in the  hemoglobin  of  red blood cells , in order to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to export carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Iron is also an essential component of  myoglobin  to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.   The human body needs iron for oxygen transport. That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.  [2]     [ edit ]   Bacterial protection   A proper iron metabolism protects against  bacterial infection . If bacteria are to survive, then they must get iron from the environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called  siderophores  and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a  metabolic price  they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against bacterial infection. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces  hepcidin  in response to inflammatory  cytokines , hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease , in which not enough iron is available to produce enough  hemoglobin -containing red blood cells.  [4]     [ edit ]   Body iron stores          1918 illustration of blood cell production in the  bone marrow . In iron deficiency, the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells, and as the deficiency gets worse, the cells become smaller.       Most well-nourished people in industrialized countries have 3-4 grams of iron in their bodies. Of this, about 2.5 g is contained in the hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen through the blood. Another 400 mg is devoted to cellular proteins that use iron for important cellular processes like storing oxygen ( myoglobin ), or performing energy-producing  redox  reactions ( cytochromes ). 3-4 mg circulates through the  plasma , bound to  transferrin .  [5]   Since so much iron is required for hemoglobin,  iron deficiency anemia  is the first and primary clinical manifestation of  iron deficiency . Oxygen transport is so important to human life that severe anemia harms or kills people by depriving their organs of enough oxygen. Iron-deficient people will suffer or die from organ damage well before cells run out of the iron needed for intracellular processes like electron transport.   Some iron in the body is stored. Physiologically, most stored iron is bound by  ferritin  molecules; the largest amount of ferritin-bound iron is found in cells of the liver  hepatocytes , the  bone marrow  and the  spleen . The liver's stores of ferritin are the primary physiologic source of reserve iron in the body.   Macrophages  of the  reticuloendothelial system  store iron as part of the process of breaking down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed  red blood cells .   Iron is also stored as a pigment called  hemosiderin  in an apparently pathologic process. This molecule appears to be mainly the result of cell damage. It is often found engulfed by  macrophages  that are scavenging regions of damage. It can also be found among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions.   Men tend to have more stored iron than women, particularly women who must use their stores to compensate for iron lost through  menstruation ,  pregnancy  or  lactation .     [ edit ]   How the body gets its iron   Most of the iron in the body is hoarded and recycled by the  reticuloendothelial system  which breaks down aged  red blood cells . However, people lose a small but steady amount by  sweating  and by shedding cells of the  skin  and the  mucosal  lining of the  gastrointestinal tract . The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of 1 mg a day for men, and 1.52 mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron. They do so via a tightly regulated process that under normal circumstances protects against iron overload.     [ edit ]   Absorbing iron from the diet          Meat contains heme, which is a source of iron.       Like most mineral nutrients, iron from digested food or supplements is almost entirely absorbed in the  duodenum  by  enterocytes  of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body.   To be absorbed, dietary iron must be in its ferrous Fe 2+  form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes'  brush border ,  Dcytb , reduces ferric Fe 3+  to Fe 2+ . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1  DMT1 , which transports all kinds of  divalent  metals into the body, then transports the iron across the enterocyte's  cell membrane  and into the cell.   These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into  feces ) or the cell can move it into the body, using a protein called  ferroportin . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, cells produce more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to  iron deficiency anemia .  [7]   Our bodies' rates of iron absorption appear to respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, the extent to which the  bone marrow  is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. We also absorb less iron during times of  inflammation . Recent discoveries demonstrate that  hepcidin  regulation of ferroportin (see below) is responsible for the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease .   While Dcytb and DMT1 are unique to iron transport across the duodenum,  ferroportin  is distributed throughout the body on all cells which store iron. Thus, regulation of  ferroportin  is the body's main way of regulating the amount of iron in circulation.   Hephaestin , a  ferroxidase  that which can oxidize Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps  ferroportin  transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells.     [ edit ]   Reasons for iron deficiency          Iron is an important topic in  prenatal care  because women can sometimes become iron-deficient from the increased iron demands of pregnancy.       Functional or actual  iron deficiency  can result from a variety of causes, explained in more detail in the article dedicated to this topic. These causes can be grouped into several categories:     Increased demand for iron, which the diet cannot accommodate.   Increased loss of iron (usually through loss of blood).   Nutritional deficiency. This can either be the result of failure to eat iron-containing foods, or eating a diet heavy in food that reduces the absorption of iron, or both.   Inability to absorb iron because of damage to the intestinal lining. Examples of causes of this kind of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like  Crohn's  or  celiac sprue  which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.   Inflammation leading to  hepcidin -induced restriction on iron release from enterocytes (see below).       [ edit ]   The possibility of too much iron   The body is able to substantially reduce the amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not seem to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of  iron intoxication . Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the  liver , the  heart  and other metabolically active organs.   Iron toxicity results when the amount of circulating iron exceeds the amount of  transferrin  available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet overdose [8]  rather than variations in  diet . Iron toxicity is usually the result of more chronic  iron overload  syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes.     [ edit ]   How cells get their iron from the body   Main article:  Iron-responsive element binding protein   As discussed above, most of the iron in the body is located on hemoglobin molecules of red blood cells. When red blood cells reach a certain age, they are degraded and engulfed by specialized scavenging  macrophages . These cells internalize the iron-containing hemoglobin, degrade it, put the iron onto transferrin molecules, and then export the transferrin-iron complexes back out into the blood. Most of the iron used for blood cell production comes from this cycle of hemoglobin recycling.   All cells use some iron, and must get it from the circulating  blood . Since iron is tightly bound to transferrin, cells throughout the body have receptors for transferrin-iron complexes on their surfaces. These receptors  engulf and internalize  both the protein and the iron attached to it. Once inside, the cell transfers the iron to  ferritin , the internal iron storage molecule.   Transferrin receptor production will increase, and ferritin production will decrease.  [9]     [ edit ]   Regulation by location   In summary, regulation of iron levels is a task of the whole body, as well as for individual cells.   When  body  levels of iron are too low, then  hepcidin  in the  duodenal epithelium  is decreased. This causes an increase in  ferroportin  activity, stimulating iron uptake in the  digestive system . Vice versa in iron surplus.   In  individual cells , an iron deficiency causes  responsive element binding protein  to  iron responsive elements  on mRNAs for  transferrin receptors , resulting in increased production of transferrin receptors. These receptors increase binding of  transferrin  to cells, and therefore stimulating iron uptake.          Electron micrograph of  E. coli . All bacteria that cause human disease require iron to live and to multiply.         [ edit ]   Diseases of iron regulation   Main article:  Iron metabolism disorder   The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic  iron overload  disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.

VLDL is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins ( chylomicrons ,  VLDL ,  IDL ,  LDL ,  HDL ) which enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water based solution of the blood stream. It is assembled in the  liver  from  cholesterol  and  apolipoproteins . It is converted in the bloodstream to  low-density lipoprotein  (LDL). VLDL particles have a diameter of 30-80  nm . VLDL transports endogenous products where  chylomicrons  transport exogenous (dietary) products.           Contents       1   Function   2   Changes during circulation   3   VLDL and disease   4   See also               [ edit ]   Function   VLDL transports endogenous triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. It functions as the body's internal transport mechanism for lipids.     [ edit ]   Changes during circulation   Nascent VLDL circulates in blood and picks up  apolipoprotein C-II  and  apolipoprotein E  donated from  High-Density Lipoprotein  (HDL). At this point, the nascent VLDL becomes a mature VLDL. Once in circulation, the VLDL will come in contact with  lipoprotein lipase  (LPL) in the capillary beds in the body (adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle). The LPL will remove triglycerides from the VLDL for storage or energy production.   The VLDL now meets back up with HDL where apoC-II is transferred back to the HDL (but keeps apoE). In addition to this, the HDL transfers cholesteryl esters to the VLDL in exchange for phospholipids and triglycerides (via  cholesteryl ester transfer protein ).   As more and more triglycerides are removed from the VLDL because of the action of the LPL enzyme, the composition of the molecule changes, and it becomes intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL).   50% of IDL are recognized by receptors in the liver cells (because of the  apoB-100  and apoE they contain) and are  endocytosed .   The other 50% of IDL lose their apoE. When their cholesterol content becomes greater than the triglyceride content, they become low-density lipoprotein (LDL), with the primary apolipoprotein being apoB-100. The LDL is taken into a cell via the LDL receptor (endocytosis) where the contents are either stored, used for cell membrane structure, or converted into other products (steroid hormones or bile acids).     [ edit ]   VLDL and disease   VLDL levels have been correlated with accelerated rates of  atherosclerosis , and are elevated in a number of diseases and metabolic states.

A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally. [ 2 ]           Contents       1   Classification     1.1   Structural classification   1.2   Functional classification   1.3   Biomechanical classification   1.4   Anatomical       2   Arthritis   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Classification          Depiction of an intervertebral disk, a cartilaginous joint.              Diagram of a synovial (diarthrosis) joint.       Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.   Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis   Main article:  Arthritis   Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

clueweb09-enwp03-22-14515	"                     Very low-density lipoprotein          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Very low-density lipoprotein  ( VLDL ) is a type of  lipoprotein  made by the  liver . VLDL is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins ( chylomicrons ,  VLDL ,  IDL ,  LDL ,  HDL ) which enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water based solution of the blood stream. It is assembled in the  liver  from  cholesterol  and  apolipoproteins . It is converted in the bloodstream to  low-density lipoprotein  (LDL). VLDL particles have a diameter of 30-80  nm . VLDL transports endogenous products where  chylomicrons  transport exogenous (dietary) products.           Contents       1   Function   2   Changes during circulation   3   VLDL and disease   4   See also               [ edit ]   Function   VLDL transports endogenous triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. It functions as the body's internal transport mechanism for lipids.     [ edit ]   Changes during circulation   Nascent VLDL circulates in blood and picks up  apolipoprotein C-II  and  apolipoprotein E  donated from  High-Density Lipoprotein  (HDL). At this point, the nascent VLDL becomes a mature VLDL. Once in circulation, the VLDL will come in contact with  lipoprotein lipase  (LPL) in the capillary beds in the body (adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle). The LPL will remove triglycerides from the VLDL for storage or energy production.   The VLDL now meets back up with HDL where apoC-II is transferred back to the HDL (but keeps apoE). In addition to this, the HDL transfers cholesteryl esters to the VLDL in exchange for phospholipids and triglycerides (via  cholesteryl ester transfer protein ).   As more and more triglycerides are removed from the VLDL because of the action of the LPL enzyme, the composition of the molecule changes, and it becomes intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL).   50% of IDL are recognized by receptors in the liver cells (because of the  apoB-100  and apoE they contain) and are  endocytosed .   The other 50% of IDL lose their apoE. When their cholesterol content becomes greater than the triglyceride content, they become low-density lipoprotein (LDL), with the primary apolipoprotein being apoB-100.

clueweb09-enwp02-27-00581	"                     Very low-density lipoprotein          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Lipoproteins, vldl )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Very low-density lipoprotein  ( VLDL ) is a type of  lipoprotein  made by the  liver . VLDL is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins ( chylomicrons ,  VLDL ,  IDL ,  LDL ,  HDL ) which enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water based solution of the blood stream. It is assembled in the  liver  from  cholesterol  and  apolipoproteins . It is converted in the bloodstream to  low-density lipoprotein  (LDL). VLDL particles have a diameter of 30-80  nm . VLDL transports endogenous products where  chylomicrons  transport exogenous (dietary) products.           Contents       1   Function   2   Changes during circulation   3   VLDL and disease   4   See also               [ edit ]   Function   VLDL transports endogenous triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. It functions as the body's internal transport mechanism for lipids.     [ edit ]   Changes during circulation   Nascent VLDL circulates in blood and picks up  apolipoprotein C-II  and  apolipoprotein E  donated from  High-Density Lipoprotein  (HDL). At this point, the nascent VLDL becomes a mature VLDL. Once in circulation, the VLDL will come in contact with  lipoprotein lipase  (LPL) in the capillary beds in the body (adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle). The LPL will remove triglycerides from the VLDL for storage or energy production.   The VLDL now meets back up with HDL where apoC-II is transferred back to the HDL (but keeps apoE). In addition to this, the HDL transfers cholesteryl esters to the VLDL in exchange for phospholipids and triglycerides (via  cholesteryl ester transfer protein ).   As more and more triglycerides are removed from the VLDL because of the action of the LPL enzyme, the composition of the molecule changes, and it becomes intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL).   50% of IDL are recognized by receptors in the liver cells (because of the  apoB-100  and apoE they contain) and are  endocytosed .   The other 50% of IDL lose their apoE. When their cholesterol content becomes greater than the triglyceride content, they become low-density lipoprotein (LDL), with the primary apolipoprotein being apoB-100. The LDL is taken into a cell via the LDL receptor (endocytosis) where the contents are either stored, used for cell membrane structure, or converted into other products (steroid hormones or bile acids).

Impact of body composition on very-low-density lipoprotein-triglycerides kinetics     Lars C. Gormsen, 1    Birgitte Nellemann, 1    Lars P. Sørensen, 1    Michael D. Jensen, 2    Jens S. Christiansen, 1   and   Søren Nielsen 1       1 Medical Department M, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus C, Denmark; and  2 Endocrine Research Unit, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota    Submitted  7 August 2008  ; accepted in final form 30 October 2008         Upper body obese (UBO) subjects have greater cardiovascular   disease risk than lower body obese (LBO) or lean subjects. Obesity   is also associated with hypertriglyceridemia that may involve   greater production and impaired removal of very-low-density   lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglycerides (TG). In these studies, we   assessed the impact of body composition on basal VLDL-TG production,   VLDL-TG oxidation, and VLDL-TG storage. VLDL-TG kinetics were   assessed in 10 UBO, 10 LBO, and 10 lean women using a bolus   injection of [1- 14 C]VLDL-TG. VLDL-TG oxidation was measured   by  14 CO 2  production (hyamine trapping) and VLDL-TG adipose tissue   storage by fat biopsies. Insulin sensititvity was assessed by   the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique and body composition   by dual X-ray absorptiometry in combination with computed tomography.   Hepatic VLDL-TG production was significantly greater in UBO   than in lean women [(µmol/min) UBO: 64.8 (SD 40.0) vs.   LBO: 42.5 (SD 25.6) vs. lean: 31.8 (SD 13.3),  P  = 0.04], whereas   VLDL-TG oxidation was similar in the three groups and averaged   20% of resting energy expenditure [(µmol/min) UBO: 38.3   (SD 26.5) vs. LBO: 23.5 (SD 13.5) vs. lean: 21.1 (SD 9.7),  P   = 0.09]. In UBO women, more VLDL-TG was deposited in upper body   subcutaneous fat [VLDL-TG redeposition in abdominal adipose   tissue (µmol/min): UBO: 5.0 (SD 2.9) vs. LBO: 4.0 (SD   3.2) vs. lean: 1.3 (SD 1.0), ANOVA  P  = 0.01]; in LBO women,   more VLDL-TG was deposited in femoral fat [VLDL-TG redeposition   in femoral adipose tissue (µmol/min): UBO: 5.1 (SD 3.1)   vs. LBO: 5.8 (SD 4.3) vs. lean: 2.3 (SD 1.5), ANOVA  P  = 0.04].   Only a small proportion of VLDL-TG (8–16%) was partitioned   into redeposition in either group. We found that elevated VLDL-TG   production without concomitant increased clearance via oxidation   and adipose tissue redeposition contributes to hypertriglyceridemia   in UBO women.       very-low-density lipoprotein-triglycerides; body composition; obesity; tracers; fat biopsies        Address for reprint requests and other correspondence: L.

Since these molecules are oils, they are essentially insoluble in the aqueous environment of the intestine. The solubilization (or emulsification) of dietary lipids is thereforeaccomplished by means of bile salts, which are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and then stored in the gallbladder; they are secreted following the ingestion of fat.   The emulsification of dietary fats renders them accessible to pancreatic lipases (primarily lipase and phospholipase A 2 ). These enzymes, secreted into the intestine from the pancreas, generate free fatty acids and a mixtures of mono- and diacylglycerols from dietary triacylglycerols. Pancreatic lipase degrades triacylglycerols at the 1 and 3 positions sequentially to generate 1,2-diacylglycerols and 2-acylglycerols. Phospholipids are degraded at the 2 position by pancreatic phospholipase A 2  releasing a free fatty acid and the lysophospholipid. The products of pancreatic lipases then diffuse into the intestinal epithelial cells, where the re-synthesis of triacyglycerols occurs.   Dietary triacylglycerols and cholesterol, as well as triacylglycerols and cholesterol synthesized by the liver, are solubilized in lipid-protein complexes. These complexes contain triacylglycerol lipid droplets and cholesteryl esters surrounded by the polar phospholipids and proteins identified as apolipoproteins.

Chylomicrons are, therefore, the molecules formed to mobilize dietary (exogenous) lipids. The predominant lipids of chylomicrons are triacylglycerols (see Table above). The apolipoproteins that predominate before the chylomicrons enter the circulation include apoB-48 and apoA-I, -A-II and IV. ApoB-48 combines only with chylomicrons.  Chylomicrons leave the intestine via the lymphatic system and enter the circulation at the left subclavian vein. In the bloodstream, chylomicrons acquire apoC-II and apoE from plasma HDLs. In the capillaries of adipose tissue and muscle, the fatty acids of chylomicrons are removed from the triacylglycerols by the action of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is found on the surface of the endothelial cells of the capillaries. The apoC-II in the chylomicrons activates LPL in the presence of phospholipid. The free fatty acids are then absorbed by the tissues and the glycerol backbone of the triacylglycerols is returned, via the blood, to the liver and kidneys. Glycerol is converted to the glycolytic intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). During the removal of fatty acids, a substantial portion of phospholipid, apoA and apoC is transferred to HDLs. The loss of apoC-II prevents LPL from further degrading the chylomicron remnants.  Chylomicron remnants, containing primarily cholesterol, apoE and apoB-48, are then delivered to, and taken up by, the liver through interaction with the chylomicron remnant receptor. The recognition of chylomicron remnants by the hepatic remnant receptor requires apoE. Chylomicrons function to deliver dietary triacylglycerols to adipose tissue and muscle and dietary cholesterol to the liver.    back to the top     Very Low Density Lipoproteins, LDLs   The dietary intake of both fat and carbohydrate, in excess of the needs of the body, leads to their conversion into triacylglycerols in the liver. These triacylglycerols are packaged into VLDLs and released into the circulation for delivery to the various tissues (primarily muscle and adipose tissue) for storage or production of energy through oxidation. VLDLs are, therefore, the molecules formed to transport endogenously derived triacylglycerols to extra-hepatic tissues. In addition to triacylglycerols, VLDLs contain some cholesterol and cholesteryl esters and the apoproteins, apoB-100, apoC-I, apoC-II, apoC-III and apoE. Like nascent chylomicrons, newly released VLDLs acquire apoCs and apoE from circulating HDLs.  The fatty acid portion of VLDLs is released to adipose tissue and muscle in the same way as for chylomicrons, through the action of lipoprotein lipase. The action of lipoprotein lipase coupled to a loss of certain apoproteins (the apoCs) converts VLDLs to intermediate density lipoproteins (IDLs), also termed VLDL remnants. The apoCs are transferred to HDLs. The predominant remaining proteins are apoB-100 and apoE. Further loss of triacylglycerols converts IDLs to LDLs.    back to the top     Intermediate Density Lipoproteins, IDLs   IDLs are formed as triacylglycerols are removed from VLDLs. The fate of IDLs is either conversion to LDLs or direct uptake by the liver. Conversion of IDLs to LDLs occurs as more triacylglycerols are removed. The liver takes up IDLs after they have interacted with the LDL receptor to form a complex, which is endocytosed by the cell. For LDL receptors in the liver to recognize IDLs requires the presence of both apoB-100 and apoE (the LDL receptor is also called the apoB-100/apoE receptor). The importance of apoE in cholesterol uptake by LDL receptors has been demonstrated in transgenic mice lacking functional apoE genes. These mice develop severe atherosclerotic lesions at 10 weeks of age.    back to the top     Low Density Lipoproteins, LDLs   The cellular requirement for cholesterol as a membrane component is satisfied in one of two ways: either it is synthesized  de novo  within the cell, or it is supplied from extra-cellular sources, namely, chylomicrons and LDLs. As indicated above, the dietary cholesterol that goes into chylomicrons is supplied to the liver by the interaction of chylomicron remnants with the remnant receptor. In addition, cholesterol synthesized by the liver can be transported to extra-hepatic tissues if packaged in VLDLs. In the circulation VLDLs are converted to LDLs through the action of lipoprotein lipase. LDLs are the primary plasma carriers of cholesterol for delivery to all tissues.  The exclusive apolipoprotein of LDLs is apoB-100. LDLs are taken up by cells via LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis, as described above for IDL uptake. The uptake of LDLs occurs predominantly in liver (75%), adrenals and adipose tissue. As with IDLs, the interaction of LDLs with LDL receptors requires the presence of apoB-100. The endocytosed membrane vesicles (endosomes) fuse with lysosomes, in which the apoproteins are degraded and the cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed to yield free cholesterol. The cholesterol is then incorporated into the plasma membranes as necessary. Excess intracellular cholesterol is re-esterified by acyl-CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase ( ACAT ), for intracellular storage. The activity of ACAT is enhanced by the presence of intracellular cholesterol.  Insulin and tri-iodothyronine (T3) increase the binding of LDLs to liver cells, whereas glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone) have the opposite effect. The precise mechanism for these effects is unclear but may be mediated through the regulation of apoB degradation. The effects of insulin and T3 on hepatic LDL binding may explain the hypercholesterolemia and increased risk of athersclerosis that have been shown to be associated with uncontrolled diabetes or hypothyroidism.  An abnormal form of LDL, identified as lipoprotein-X ( Lp-X ), predominates in the circulation of patients suffering from lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase ( LCAT , see HDL discussion for LCAT function) deficiency or cholestatic liver disease. In both cases there is an elevation in the level of circulating free cholesterol and phospholipids.    back to the top     High Density Lipoproteins, HDLs   HDLs are synthesized  de novo  in the liver and small intestine, as primarily protein-rich disc-shaped particles. These newly formed HDLs are nearly devoid of any cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. The primary apoproteins of HDLs are apoA-I, apoC-I, apoC-II and apoE. In fact, a major function of HDLs is to act as circulating stores of apoC-I, apoC-II and apoE.  HDLs are converted into spherical lipoprotein particles through the accumulation of cholesteryl esters. This accumulation converts nascent HDLs to HDL 2  and HDL 3 . Any free cholesterol present in chylomicron remnants and VLDL remnants (IDLs) can be esterified through the action of the HDL-associated enzyme, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, LCAT. LCAT is synthesized in the liver and so named because it transfers a fatty acid from the C-2 position of lecithin to the C-3-OH of cholesterol, generating a cholesteryl ester and lysolecithin. The activity of LCAT requires interaction with apoA-I, which is found on the surface of HDLs.  Cholesterol-rich HDLs return to the liver, where they are endocytosed. Hepatic uptake of HDLs, or reverse cholesterol transport, may be mediated through an HDL-specific apoA-I receptor or through lipid-lipid interactions. Macrophages also take up HDLs through apoA-I receptor interaction. HDLs can then acquire cholesterol and apoE from the macrophages; cholesterol-enriched HDLs are then secreted from the macrophages. The added apoE in these HDLs leads to an increase in their uptake and catabolism by the liver.  HDLs also acquire cholesterol by extracting it from cell surface membranes. This process has the effect of lowering the level of intracellular cholesterol, since the cholesterol stored within cells as cholesteryl esters will be mobilized to replace the cholesterol removed from the plasma membrane.  The cholesterol esters of HDLs can also be transferred to VLDLs and LDLs through the action of the HDL-associated enzyme, cholesterol ester transfer protein ( CETP ). This has the added effect of allowing the excess cellular cholesterol to be returned to the liver through the LDL-receptor pathway as well as the HDL-receptor pathway.    back to the top     LDL Receptors   LDLs are the principal plasma carriers of cholesterol delivering cholesterol from the liver (via hepatic synthesis of VLDLs) to peripheral tissues, primarily the adrenals and adipose tissue. LDLs also return cholesterol to the liver. The cellular uptake of cholesterol from LDLs occurs following the interaction of LDLs with the LDL receptor (also called the apoB-100/apoE receptor). The sole apoprotein present in LDLs is apoB-100, which is required for interaction with the LDL receptor.  The LDL receptor is a polypeptide of 839 amino acids that spans the plasma membrane. An extracellular domain is responsible for apoB-100/apoE binding. The intracellular domain is responsible for the clustering of LDL receptors into regions of the plasma membrane termed coated pits. Once LDL binds the receptor, the complexes are rapidly internalized (endocytosed). ATP-dependent proton pumps lower the pH in the endosomes, which results in dissociation of the LDL from the receptor. The portion of the endosomal membranes harboring the receptor are then recycled to the plasma membrane and the LDL-containing endosomes fuse with lysosomes. Acid hydrolases of the lysosomes degrade the apoproteins and release free fatty acids and cholesterol. As indicated above, the free cholesterol is either incorporated into plasma membranes or esterified (by ACAT) and stored within the cell.  The level of intracellular cholesterol is regulated through cholesterol-induced suppression of LDL receptor synthesis and cholesterol-induced inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. The increased level of intracellular cholesterol that results from LDL uptake has the additional effect of activating ACAT, thereby allowing the storage of excess cholesterol within cells. However, the effect of cholesterol-induced suppression of LDL receptor synthesis is a decrease in the rate at which LDLs and IDLs are removed from the serum. This can lead to excess circulating levels of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters when the dietary intake of fat and cholesterol exceeds the needs of the body. The excess cholesterol tends to be deposited in the skin, tendons and (more gravely) within the arteries, leading to atherosclerosis.    back to the top     Clinical Significances of Lipoprotein Metabolism   Fortunately, few individuals carry the inherited defects in lipoprotein metabolism that lead to  hyper-  or  hypolipoproteinemias  (see Tables below for brief descriptions). Persons suffering from  diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism and kidney disease often exhibit abnormal lipoprotein metabolism as a result of secondary effects of their disorders. For example, because lipoprotein lipase (LPL) synthesis is regulated by insulin, LPL deficiencies leading to  Type I hyperlipoproteinemia  may occur as a secondary outcome of diabetes mellitus. Additionally, insulin and thyroid hormones positively affect hepatic LDL-receptor interactions; therefore, the hypercholesterolemia and increased risk of athersclerosis associated with uncontrolled diabetes or hypothyroidism is likely due to decreased hepatic LDL uptake and metabolism.  Of the many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism,  familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)  may be the most prevalent in the general population. Heterozygosity at the FH locus occurs in 1:500 individuals, whereas, homozygosity is observed in 1:1,000,000 individuals. FH is an inherited disorder comprising four different classes of mutation in the LDL receptor gene. The class 1 defect (the most common) results in a complete loss of receptor synthesis. The class 2 defect results in the synthesis of a receptor protein that is not properly processed in the Golgi apparatus and therefore is not transported to the plasma membrane. The class 3 defect results in an LDL receptor that is incapable of binding LDLs. The class 4 defect results in receptors that bind LDLs but do not cluster in coated pits and are, therefore, not internalized.  FH sufferers may be either heterozygous or homologous for a particular mutation in the receptor gene. Homozygotes exhibit grossly elevated serum cholesterol (primarily in LDLs). The elevated levels of LDLs result in their phagocytosis by macrophages. These lipid-laden phagocytic cells tend to deposit within the skin and tendons, leading to xanthomas. A greater complication results from cholesterol deposition within the arteries, leading to atherosclerosis, the major contributing factor of nearly all cardiovascular diseases.    back to the top      Hyperlipoproteinemias         Disorder   Defect   Comments      Type I (familial LPL deficiency, familial hyperchylomicronemia)   ( a ) deficiency of LPL; ( b ) production of abnormal LPL; ( c ) apoC-II deficiency   slow chylomicron clearance, reduced LDL and HDL levels; treated by low fat/complex carbohydrate diet; no increased risk of coronary artery disease      Type II (familial hypercholesterolemia, FH)   4 classes of LDL receptor defect   reduced LDL clearance leads to hypercholesterolemia, resulting in athersclerosis and coronary artery disease      Type III (familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, remnant removal disease, broad beta disease, apolipoprotein E deficiency)   hepatic remnant clearance impaired due to apoE abnormality; patients only express the apoE 2  isoform that interacts poorly with the apoE receptor   causes xanthomas, hypercholesterolemia and athersclerosis in peripheral and coronary arteries due to elevated levels of chylomicrons and VLDLs      Type IV (familial hypertriacylglycerolemia)   elevated production of VLDL associated with glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia   frequently associated with type-II non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity, alcoholism or administration of progestational hormones; elevated cholesterol as a result of increased VLDLs      Type V familial   elevated chylomicrons and VLDLs due to unknown cause   hypertriacylglycerolemia and hypercholesterolemia with decreased LDLs and HDLs      Familial hyperalphalipoproteinemia   increased level of HDLs   a rare condition that is beneficial for health and longevity      Type II Familial hyperbetalipoproteinemia   increased LDL production and delayed clearance of triacylglycerols and fatty acids   strongly associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease      Familial ligand-defective apoB   2 different mutations: Gln for Arg (amino acid 3500) or Cys for Arg (amino acid 3531); both lead to reduced affinity of LDL for LDL receptor   dramatic increase in LDL levels; no affect on HDL, VLDL or plasma triglyceride levels; significant cause of hypercholesterolemia and premature coronary artery disease      Familial LCAT deficiency   absence of LCAT leads to inability of HDLs to take up cholesterol (reverse cholesterol transport)   decreased levels of plasma cholesteryl esters and lysolecithin; abnormal LDLs (Lp-X) and VLDLs; symptoms also found associated with cholestasis         Wolman disease (cholesteryl ester storage disease)     defect in lysosomal cholesteryl ester hydrolase; affects metabolism of LDLs     reduced LDL clearance leads to hypercholesterolemia, resulting in athersclerosis and coronary artery disease        heparin-releasable hepatic triglyceride lipase deficiency   deficiency of the lipase leads to accumulation of triacylglycerol-rich HDLs and VLDL remnants (IDLs)   causes xanthomas and coronary artery disease       back to the top     Hypolipoproteinemias         Disorder   Defect   Comments      Abetalipoproteinemia (acanthocytosis, Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome)   no chylomicrons, VLDLs or LDLs due to defect in apoB expression   rare defect; intestine and liver accumulate, malabsorption of fat, retinitis pigmentosa, ataxic neuropathic disease, erythrocytes have thorny appearance      Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia   at least 20 different apoB gene mutations identified, LDL concentrations 10-20% of normal, VLDL slightly lower, HDL normal   mild or no pathological changes      Familial alpha-lipoprotein deficiency (Tangier disease, Fish-eye disease, apoA-I and -C-III deficiencies)   all of these related syndromes have reduced HDL concentrations, no effect on chylomicron or VLDL production   tendency to hypertriacylglycerolemia; some elevation in VLDLs; Fish-eye disease characterized by severe corneal opacity        back to the top     Pharmacologic Intervention   Drug treatment to lower plasma lipoproteins and/or cholesterol is primarily aimed at reducing the risk of athersclerosis and subsequent coronary artery disease that exists in patients with elevated circulating lipids. Drug therapy usually is considered as an option only if non-pharmacologic interventions (altered diet and exercise) have failed to lower plasma lipids.   Atorvastatin (Lipotor®), Simvastatin (Zocor®), Lovastatin (Mevacor®):  These drugs are fungal HMG-CoA reductase  (HMGR) inhibitors and are members of the family of drugs referred to as the  statins . The net result of treatment is an increased cellular uptake of LDLs, since the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol is inhibited and cells are therefore dependent on extracellular sources of cholesterol. However, since mevalonate (the product of the HMG-CoA reductase reaction) is required for the synthesis of other important isoprenoid compounds besides cholesterol, long-term treatments carry some risk of toxicity.   The statins have become recognized as a class of drugs capable of more  pharmacologic benefits than  just lowering blood cholesterol levels via their actions on HMGR. Part of the  cardiac benefit of the statins relates to their ability to regulate the  production of  S -nitrosylated COX-2. COX-2 is an inducible enzyme involved in the  synthesis of the  prostaglandins and thromboxanes  as well as the lipoxins and  resolvins. The latter two classes of compounds are anti-inflammatory lipids  discussed in the  Aspirin page . Evidence has shown  that statins activate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) leading to  nitrosylation of COX-2. The  S -nitrosylated  COX-2 enzyme produces the lipid compound 15 R -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid  (15 R -HETE) which is then converted via the action of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)  to the  epimeric lipoxin, 15-epi-LXA 4 . This latter compound is the same as the  aspirin-triggered lipoxin (ATL) that results from the aspirin-induced  acetylation of COX-2. Therefore, part of the beneficial effects of the statins  are exerted via the actions of the lipoxin family of anti-inflammatory lipids.   Nicotinic acid:  Nicotinic acid reduces the plasma levels of both VLDLs and LDLs by inhibiting hepatic VLDL secretion, as well as suppressing the flux of FFA release from adipose tissue by inhibiting lipolysis. Because of its ability to cause large reductions in circulating levels of cholesterol, nicotinic acid is used to treat Type II, III, IV and V hyperlipoproteinemias.   Gemfibrozil (Lopid®), Fenofibrate (TriCor®):  These compounds (called fibrates) are derivatives of fibric acid and  although used clinically since the 1930's were only recently discovered to exert some of their lipid-lowering effects via the activation  of peroxisome proliferation. Specifically, the fibrates were found to be  activators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) class of  proteins that are classified as co-activators. The naturally occurring ligands  for PPAR-α are leukotriene B 4  (LTB 4 , see the  Lipid Synthesis page ),  unsaturated fatty acids and oxidized components of VLDLs and LDLs. The PPARs interact with another  receptor family called the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) that bind 9- cis -retinoic  acid. Activation of PPARs results in modulation of the expression of genes  involved in lipid metabolism. In addition the PPARs modulate carbohydrate  metabolism and adipose tissue differentiation. Fibrates result in the activation of PPAR-α in liver and muscle.  In the liver this leads to increased  β-oxidation of fatty acids, thereby decreasing the liver's secretion of  triacylglycerol- and cholesterol-rich VLDLs, as well as increased  clearance of chylomicron remnants, increased levels of HDLs and increased  lipoprotein lipase activity which in turn promotes rapid VLDL turnover.   Cholestyramine or colestipol (resins):  These compounds are nonabsorbable resins that bind bile acids which are then not reabsorbed by the liver but excreted. The drop in hepatic reabsorption of bile acids releases a feedback inhibitory mechanism that had been inhibiting bile acid synthesis. As a result, a greater amount of cholesterol is converted to bile acids to maintain a steady level in circulation. Additionally, the synthesis of LDL receptors increases to allow increased cholesterol uptake for bile acid synthesis, and the overall effect is a reduction in plasma cholesterol. This treatment is ineffective in homozygous FH patients, since they are completely deficient in LDL receptors.    back to the top     Return to The Medical Biochemistry Page    Michael W.

VLDL is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins ( chylomicrons ,  VLDL ,  IDL ,  LDL ,  HDL ) which enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water based solution of the blood stream. It is assembled in the  liver  from  cholesterol  and  apolipoproteins . It is converted in the bloodstream to  low-density lipoprotein  (LDL). VLDL particles have a diameter of 30-80  nm . VLDL transports endogenous products where  chylomicrons  transport exogenous (dietary) products.           Contents       1   Function   2   Changes during circulation   3   VLDL and disease   4   See also               [ edit ]   Function   VLDL transports endogenous triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. It functions as the body's internal transport mechanism for lipids.     [ edit ]   Changes during circulation   Nascent VLDL circulates in blood and picks up  apolipoprotein C-II  and  apolipoprotein E  donated from  High-Density Lipoprotein  (HDL). At this point, the nascent VLDL becomes a mature VLDL. Once in circulation, the VLDL will come in contact with  lipoprotein lipase  (LPL) in the capillary beds in the body (adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle). The LPL will remove triglycerides from the VLDL for storage or energy production.   The VLDL now meets back up with HDL where apoC-II is transferred back to the HDL (but keeps apoE). In addition to this, the HDL transfers cholesteryl esters to the VLDL in exchange for phospholipids and triglycerides (via  cholesteryl ester transfer protein ).   As more and more triglycerides are removed from the VLDL because of the action of the LPL enzyme, the composition of the molecule changes, and it becomes intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL).   50% of IDL are recognized by receptors in the liver cells (because of the  apoB-100  and apoE they contain) and are  endocytosed .   The other 50% of IDL lose their apoE. When their cholesterol content becomes greater than the triglyceride content, they become low-density lipoprotein (LDL), with the primary apolipoprotein being apoB-100.

VLDL is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins ( chylomicrons ,  VLDL ,  IDL ,  LDL ,  HDL ) which enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water based solution of the blood stream. It is assembled in the  liver  from  cholesterol  and  apolipoproteins . It is converted in the bloodstream to  low-density lipoprotein  (LDL). VLDL particles have a diameter of 30-80  nm . VLDL transports endogenous products where  chylomicrons  transport exogenous (dietary) products.           Contents       1   Function   2   Changes during circulation   3   VLDL and disease   4   See also               [ edit ]   Function   VLDL transports endogenous triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. It functions as the body's internal transport mechanism for lipids.     [ edit ]   Changes during circulation   Nascent VLDL circulates in blood and picks up  apolipoprotein C-II  and  apolipoprotein E  donated from  High-Density Lipoprotein  (HDL). At this point, the nascent VLDL becomes a mature VLDL. Once in circulation, the VLDL will come in contact with  lipoprotein lipase  (LPL) in the capillary beds in the body (adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle). The LPL will remove triglycerides from the VLDL for storage or energy production.   The VLDL now meets back up with HDL where apoC-II is transferred back to the HDL (but keeps apoE). In addition to this, the HDL transfers cholesteryl esters to the VLDL in exchange for phospholipids and triglycerides (via  cholesteryl ester transfer protein ).   As more and more triglycerides are removed from the VLDL because of the action of the LPL enzyme, the composition of the molecule changes, and it becomes intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL).   50% of IDL are recognized by receptors in the liver cells (because of the  apoB-100  and apoE they contain) and are  endocytosed .   The other 50% of IDL lose their apoE. When their cholesterol content becomes greater than the triglyceride content, they become low-density lipoprotein (LDL), with the primary apolipoprotein being apoB-100. The LDL is taken into a cell via the LDL receptor (endocytosis) where the contents are either stored, used for cell membrane structure, or converted into other products (steroid hormones or bile acids).

clueweb09-enwp00-38-00730	"                     Joint          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Articular branches )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          For other uses, see  Joint (disambiguation) .   A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally. [ 2 ]           Contents       1   Classification     1.1   Structural classification   1.2   Functional classification   1.3   Biomechanical classification   1.4   Anatomical       2   Arthritis   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Classification          Depiction of an intervertebral disk, a cartilaginous joint.              Diagram of a synovial (diarthrosis) joint.       Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.   Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis       Main article:  Arthritis       Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

Human iron metabolism  is the set of chemical reactions maintaining  human homeostasis  of  iron . Iron is an essential element for most life on Earth, including  human beings . The control of this necessary but potentially  toxic  substance is an important part of many aspects of human  health  and  disease .  Hematologists  have been especially interested in the system of iron  metabolism  because iron is essential to  red blood cells . Most of the  human body 's iron is contained in red blood cells'  hemoglobin , and  iron deficiency anemia  is the most common type of  anemia .   Understanding this system is also important for understanding diseases of  iron overload , like  hemochromatosis .   Recent discoveries in the field have shed new light on how humans control the level of iron in their bodies and created new understanding of the mechanisms of several diseases.

Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of life, including humans and most  bacterial  species. Because  plants  and  animals  all use iron, iron can be found in a wide variety of food sources.   Iron is essential to life, because of its unique ability to serve as both an  electron donor  and  acceptor .   Iron can also be potentially toxic. Its ability to donate and accept electrons means that if iron is free within the cell, it can  catalyze  the conversion of  hydrogen peroxide  into  free radicals . Free radicals can cause damage to a wide variety of cellular structures, and ultimately kill the cell. To prevent that kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to  proteins . That allows the cells to use the benefits of iron, but also limit its ability to do harm.  [1]   The most important group of iron-binding proteins contain the  heme  molecules, all of which contain iron at their centers. Humans and most bacteria use variants of  heme  to carry out  redox  reactions and  electron transport  processes. These reactions and processes are required for  oxidative phosphorylation . That process is the principal source of energy for human cells; without it, our cells would die.   The  iron-sulfur proteins  are another important group of iron-containing proteins. Some of these proteins are also essential parts of oxidative phosphorylation.   Humans also use iron in the  hemoglobin  of  red blood cells , in order to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to export carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Iron is also an essential component of  myoglobin  to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.   The human body needs iron for oxygen transport. That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.  [2]     [ edit ]   Bacterial protection   A proper iron metabolism protects against  bacterial infection . If bacteria are to survive, then they must get iron from the environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called  siderophores  and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a  metabolic price  they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against bacterial infection. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces  hepcidin  in response to inflammatory  cytokines , hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease , in which not enough iron is available to produce enough  hemoglobin -containing red blood cells.  [4]     [ edit ]   Body iron stores          1918 illustration of blood cell production in the  bone marrow . In iron deficiency, the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells, and as the deficiency gets worse, the cells become smaller.       Most well-nourished people in industrialized countries have 3-4 grams of iron in their bodies. Of this, about 2.5 g is contained in the hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen through the blood. Another 400 mg is devoted to cellular proteins that use iron for important cellular processes like storing oxygen ( myoglobin ), or performing energy-producing  redox  reactions ( cytochromes ). 3-4 mg circulates through the  plasma , bound to  transferrin .  [5]   Since so much iron is required for hemoglobin,  iron deficiency anemia  is the first and primary clinical manifestation of  iron deficiency . Oxygen transport is so important to human life that severe anemia harms or kills people by depriving their organs of enough oxygen. Iron-deficient people will suffer or die from organ damage well before cells run out of the iron needed for intracellular processes like electron transport.   Some iron in the body is stored. Physiologically, most stored iron is bound by  ferritin  molecules; the largest amount of ferritin-bound iron is found in cells of the liver  hepatocytes , the  bone marrow  and the  spleen . The liver's stores of ferritin are the primary physiologic source of reserve iron in the body.   Macrophages  of the  reticuloendothelial system  store iron as part of the process of breaking down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed  red blood cells .   Iron is also stored as a pigment called  hemosiderin  in an apparently pathologic process. This molecule appears to be mainly the result of cell damage. It is often found engulfed by  macrophages  that are scavenging regions of damage. It can also be found among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions.   Men tend to have more stored iron than women, particularly women who must use their stores to compensate for iron lost through  menstruation ,  pregnancy  or  lactation .     [ edit ]   How the body gets its iron   Most of the iron in the body is hoarded and recycled by the  reticuloendothelial system  which breaks down aged  red blood cells . However, people lose a small but steady amount by  sweating  and by shedding cells of the  skin  and the  mucosal  lining of the  gastrointestinal tract . The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of 1 mg a day for men, and 1.52 mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron. They do so via a tightly regulated process that under normal circumstances protects against iron overload.     [ edit ]   Absorbing iron from the diet          Meat contains heme, which is a source of iron.       Like most mineral nutrients, iron from digested food or supplements is almost entirely absorbed in the  duodenum  by  enterocytes  of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body.   To be absorbed, dietary iron must be in its ferrous Fe 2+  form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes'  brush border ,  Dcytb , reduces ferric Fe 3+  to Fe 2+ . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1  DMT1 , which transports all kinds of  divalent  metals into the body, then transports the iron across the enterocyte's  cell membrane  and into the cell.   These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into  feces ) or the cell can move it into the body, using a protein called  ferroportin . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, cells produce more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to  iron deficiency anemia .  [7]   Our bodies' rates of iron absorption appear to respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, the extent to which the  bone marrow  is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. We also absorb less iron during times of  inflammation . Recent discoveries demonstrate that  hepcidin  regulation of ferroportin (see below) is responsible for the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease .   While Dcytb and DMT1 are unique to iron transport across the duodenum,  ferroportin  is distributed throughout the body on all cells which store iron. Thus, regulation of  ferroportin  is the body's main way of regulating the amount of iron in circulation.   Hephaestin , a  ferroxidase  that which can oxidize Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps  ferroportin  transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells.     [ edit ]   Reasons for iron deficiency          Iron is an important topic in  prenatal care  because women can sometimes become iron-deficient from the increased iron demands of pregnancy.       Functional or actual  iron deficiency  can result from a variety of causes, explained in more detail in the article dedicated to this topic. These causes can be grouped into several categories:     Increased demand for iron, which the diet cannot accommodate.   Increased loss of iron (usually through loss of blood).   Nutritional deficiency. This can either be the result of failure to eat iron-containing foods, or eating a diet heavy in food that reduces the absorption of iron, or both.   Inability to absorb iron because of damage to the intestinal lining. Examples of causes of this kind of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like  Crohn's  or  celiac sprue  which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.   Inflammation leading to  hepcidin -induced restriction on iron release from enterocytes (see below).       [ edit ]   The possibility of too much iron   The body is able to substantially reduce the amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not seem to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of  iron intoxication . Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the  liver , the  heart  and other metabolically active organs.   Iron toxicity results when the amount of circulating iron exceeds the amount of  transferrin  available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet overdose [8]  rather than variations in  diet . Iron toxicity is usually the result of more chronic  iron overload  syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes.     [ edit ]   How cells get their iron from the body   Main article:  Iron-responsive element binding protein   As discussed above, most of the iron in the body is located on hemoglobin molecules of red blood cells. When red blood cells reach a certain age, they are degraded and engulfed by specialized scavenging  macrophages . These cells internalize the iron-containing hemoglobin, degrade it, put the iron onto transferrin molecules, and then export the transferrin-iron complexes back out into the blood. Most of the iron used for blood cell production comes from this cycle of hemoglobin recycling.   All cells use some iron, and must get it from the circulating  blood . Since iron is tightly bound to transferrin, cells throughout the body have receptors for transferrin-iron complexes on their surfaces. These receptors  engulf and internalize  both the protein and the iron attached to it. Once inside, the cell transfers the iron to  ferritin , the internal iron storage molecule.   Transferrin receptor production will increase, and ferritin production will decrease.  [9]     [ edit ]   Regulation by location   In summary, regulation of iron levels is a task of the whole body, as well as for individual cells.   When  body  levels of iron are too low, then  hepcidin  in the  duodenal epithelium  is decreased. This causes an increase in  ferroportin  activity, stimulating iron uptake in the  digestive system . Vice versa in iron surplus.   In  individual cells , an iron deficiency causes  responsive element binding protein  to  iron responsive elements  on mRNAs for  transferrin receptors , resulting in increased production of transferrin receptors. These receptors increase binding of  transferrin  to cells, and therefore stimulating iron uptake.          Electron micrograph of  E. coli . All bacteria that cause human disease require iron to live and to multiply.         [ edit ]   Diseases of iron regulation   Main article:  Iron metabolism disorder   The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic  iron overload  disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.

Molecular determinants of fragments in vWF were also   characterized to identify possible sites of cleavage of the subunit.   Unusually large vWF multimers were found in blood of 8 of 10 patients   with recurrent HUS/TTP, both in the acute phase and in remission,   but never in familial and sporadic cases. Instead, all of the   groups showed evidence of enhanced fragmentation of vWF multimers   during the acute phase. Increased fragmentation was also shown   by decrease in native 225-kD vWF subunit. In recurrent and sporadic   HUS/TTP, enhanced fragmentation normalized at remission, but the   abnormality persisted in familial HUS/TTP patients. The latter   findings suggest that patients with familial HUS/TTP may have   a congenital abnormality in vWF processing. Analysis with specific   monoclonal antibodies showed the presence of the normal vWF fragments   with apparent molecular mass of 189, 176, and 140 kD in all patients;   however, in 6 recurrent and in 5 familial cases, novel fragments   that differed in size from normal ones were found. The size of   these abnormal fragments differed from one patient to another   and none of them was ever found in normal plasma. These results   documented, for the first time in HUS/TTP, an abnormal cleavage   of the vWF subunit that might account for the increased fragmentation   observed in these   patients.    © 1999 by The American Society of Hematology.                                                                        INTRODUCTION                TOP     ABSTRACT     INTRODUCTION      MATERIALS AND METHODS     RESULTS     DISCUSSION     APPENDIX     REFERENCES                H EMOLYTIC UREMIC syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are syndromes of hemolytic anemia and   thrombocytopenia, which have in common thrombotic occlusion of   the microvasculature of various organs 1  attributed to platelet   consumption and erythrocyte disruption. 2  The term HUS better   describes a disease of children who mostly have renal insufficiency, 3   whereas TTP is often used for adult cases who predominantly, but   by no means exclusively, suffer neurological symptoms. 2  The   two syndromes have different manifestations given the different   organ distribution of the lesions, but share the same histopathology,   ie, widening of the subendothelial space and intravascular platelet   thrombi, which presumably reflect a massive endothelial damage   as initiating event. 1  Whether the findings given above can   be taken as indicative of a similar sequence of pathogenic events   is still unclear. The classical form of children HUS, which is   mostly sporadic, has remarkably better prognosis 3  than forms   with tendency to recur that often occur in families. 1  Whereas   classical children HUS is strongly linked to  Escherichia coli   infection, 1 , 3  the recurrent form may not have a recognizable   causative agent and a genetically determined condition has been   proposed. 1 , 4-6  Evidence that some cases were cured with plasma   manipulation suggested a genetic abnormality of plasma component(s)   normally modulating endothelial function. After immunohistology   studies showing accumulation of von Willebrand factor (vWF) in   microvascular thrombi, 7  endothelial vWF secretion and handling   were extensively evaluated in these conditions. In normals, vWF   is formed as large multimers (ultra large [UL] multimers) due   to the polymerization in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes   of a native subunit with apparent molecular mass of 225 kD 8   and is stored as such in Weibel-Palade bodies and platelet   granules.   UL multimers do not normally circulate, due to a blood specific   protease 9  that reduces them into smaller multimers soon after   their secretion cleaving the molecule at position 842 Tyr 843   Met of the mature subunit. 10  Evidence that proteolytic cleavage   is involved in the modification of plasma multimers after secretion   has been provided by studies showing that circulating vWF multimers   are heterogeneous oligomers of a native 225-kD subunit and of   proteolytic fragments with apparent molecular masses of 189, 176,   and 140 kD. 10-12  In patients with HUS and TTP, in contrast to healthy   subjects, UL multimers, similar to the ones stored in endothelial   cells and platelets, were occasionally detected in plasma. 13-15   In cases who recovered after a single episode, UL multimers were   found almost exclusively in the acute phase but no longer in remission,   suggesting a massive release from endothelial storage sites 8   that possibly overwhelmed transiently the plasma proteolytic capacity. 16   By contrast, those cases who had a tendency to recur had circulating   UL multimers either in the acute and consistently in the remission   phase of the disease, which was initially taken as evidence of   a state of persistent endothelial perturbation. 13  This has been   recently challenged by findings that circulating UL multimers   in chronic relapsing TTP were associated with a reduced or totally   absent activity of a specific protease that normally cleaves vWF   in smaller multimers. 17 , 18  In two recent large studies, 19 , 20   vWF cleaving protease deficiency was described in patients with   different forms of HUS/TTP. In nonfamilial cases, an inhibitor   of vWF cleaving protease was found, whereas in the familial forms,   the defect seems to be caused by a constitutional deficiency of   the protease. However, in the studies given above, multimeric   analysis has not been performed; thus, no conclusion can be drawn   on the relationship between protease activity and UL   multimers.    Although the findings listed above may explain some of the abnormalities in vWF in the circulating blood of these patients,   circulating UL multimers were found in a patient with recurrent   TTP even in the context of a normal vWF processing activity. 21   On the other hand, we have already documented in previous studies   that the most consistent abnormality in the acute phase of plasma   resistant HUS 22  and recurrent HUS/TTP, 23  rather than the presence   of UL vWF multimers, is an increase of low molecular weight (Lmw)   multimers that would reflect an enhanced proteolytic fragmentation   of the molecule. Exactly the same was observed by Furlan et al 18   in a patient with recurrent TTP. That vWF undergoes excessive   fragmentation in the acute phase of these diseases is remarkably   consistent with previous findings of a relative decrease in the   native 225-kD vWF subunit that only occurs in the acute phase,   accompanied by a relative increase of fragments that can only   derive from the cleavage of the native subunit. 24  Whether enhanced   fragmentation depends on an exuberant activity of the plasma protease(s) 25 , 26   different from that described by Furlan et al 9  or is indeed   favored by an intrinsic modification of vWF molecule itself is   still not fully   clear.    We present here the results of a study that formally addressed the changes in multimeric structures of circulating vWF in   recurrent, familial, and sporadic forms of HUS/TTP to see whether   vWF multimers are or are not actually proteolyzed in vivo in these   patients. Finally, we characterized molecular determinants of   fragments in vWF immunopurified from patient plasma and reduced   to identify possible sites of cleavage of the     "

A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally. [ 2 ]           Contents       1   Classification     1.1   Structural classification   1.2   Functional classification   1.3   Biomechanical classification   1.4   Anatomical       2   Arthritis   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Classification          Depiction of an intervertebral disk, a cartilaginous joint.              Diagram of a synovial (diarthrosis) joint.       Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.   Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis   Main article:  Arthritis   Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

In addition, the disease resulted in bleeding from mucocutaneous sites (typical  skin and mucous membranes) rather than from deep tissues and joints. vWF is  involved in two important reactions of hemostasis ( blood  coagulation ). The first is the interaction of vWF with specific receptors on  the surface of platelets and the subendothelial connective tissue. This  interaction allows platelets to adhere to areas of vascular injury. The second  role of vWF is to bind to and stabilize factor VIII allowing factor VIII to  survive in the blood. As a consequence of these roles for vWF, deficiencies  result in defective platelet adhesion and to secondary deficiencies in factor  VIII. Since factor VIII deficiency results in  hemophilia A, it is not surprising that vWF deficiencies can manifest with  clinical symptoms that appear to be hemophilia A.   The gene for vWF resides at  the tip of the short arm of chromosome 12. The gene spans approximately 180  kilobases (kb) and consists of 52 exons. Numerous molecular alterations have  been identified in vWD including nonsense and missense mutations and gene  deletions. vWD is the most commonly occurring bleeding disorder with clinically  significant forms affecting approximately 1 in 1000 individuals. However,  abnormalities in vWF have been estimated to occur with a frequency of 1 in 100  persons, thus a relatively small fraction of persons harboring mutations in vWF  are actually symptomatic. There are both dominant and recessive forms of vWD.  The most common form of the disease (type 1) is an autosomal dominant disorder  resulting from quantitative deficiency in vWF. Recessive inheritance of a  virtual lack of vWF protein characterizes the clinically severe form of the  disease called type 3 vWD. The inheritance of qualitative defects in vWF  (dysfunctional protein) is characteristic of type 2 vWD. The type 2 category is  further subdivided into four variants that are based upon the functional  characteristics of the mutant protein. In type 2A vWD the residual vWF has  reduced function. In type 2B vWD the mutant vWF has an increased affinity for  the platelet surface protein GPIb (see the   blood coagulation  page for more information on the role of platelet  glycoproteins in hemostasis). In type 2M vWD there is the presence of normal vWF  multimeric complexes but they exhibit reduced platelet-dependent function. In  type 2N vWD there are factor VIII deficiencies that are the result of  mutations in vWF that do not bind to factor VIII.   Clinical Features of von Willebrand  Disease   In patients with type  1 and type 3 vWD (the quantitative deficiencies) the severity of the disease is  related to the degree of functional deficiency in vWF. Clinically, type 1 and 3  vWD patients can manifest from insignificant problems to life threatening  complications. Patients with type 2 vWD (the qualitative deficiencies) may  exhibit symptoms whose severity may be greater than would be expected based upon  a knowledge of the functional defect. Symptoms of vWD often present shortly  after birth. The common symptoms are easy bruising, bleeding from the gums,  cutaneous hematomas and prolonged bleeding from cuts and abrasions. Individuals  with severe forms of vWD can have bleeding complications because they either  lack sufficient vWF to promote platelet adhesion at the site of vascular injury  or they are factor VIII deficient due to the lack of the stabilizing action of  vWF on factor VIII. Therefore, the therapeutic response to vWD requires an  understanding of these distinct functions of vWF. Mucocutaneous and  post-surgical bleeding can be treated by raising the level of factor VIII. In  order to address the platelet adhesion deficit in vWD it is necessary to  increase the level of functional vWF. This can be accomplished using fresh  frozen plasma or cryoprecipitates. The limitation to these approaches is that a  large volume of frozen plasma is needed to deliver sufficient amount of vWF and  cryoprecipitates are known to be associated with possible disease transmission.  Platelet transfusions can be helpful in some patients with vWD, especially those  who are refractory to factor VIII-vWF concentrates.      return to  Blood Coagulation page      back to the Inborn Errors page        Return to The Medical Biochemistry Page     Michael W.

VLDL is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins ( chylomicrons ,  VLDL ,  IDL ,  LDL ,  HDL ) which enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water based solution of the blood stream. It is assembled in the  liver  from  cholesterol  and  apolipoproteins . It is converted in the bloodstream to  low-density lipoprotein  (LDL). VLDL particles have a diameter of 30-80  nm . VLDL transports endogenous products where  chylomicrons  transport exogenous (dietary) products.           Contents       1   Function   2   Changes during circulation   3   VLDL and disease   4   See also               [ edit ]   Function   VLDL transports endogenous triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. It functions as the body's internal transport mechanism for lipids.     [ edit ]   Changes during circulation   Nascent VLDL circulates in blood and picks up  apolipoprotein C-II  and  apolipoprotein E  donated from  High-Density Lipoprotein  (HDL). At this point, the nascent VLDL becomes a mature VLDL. Once in circulation, the VLDL will come in contact with  lipoprotein lipase  (LPL) in the capillary beds in the body (adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle). The LPL will remove triglycerides from the VLDL for storage or energy production.   The VLDL now meets back up with HDL where apoC-II is transferred back to the HDL (but keeps apoE). In addition to this, the HDL transfers cholesteryl esters to the VLDL in exchange for phospholipids and triglycerides (via  cholesteryl ester transfer protein ).   As more and more triglycerides are removed from the VLDL because of the action of the LPL enzyme, the composition of the molecule changes, and it becomes intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL).   50% of IDL are recognized by receptors in the liver cells (because of the  apoB-100  and apoE they contain) and are  endocytosed .   The other 50% of IDL lose their apoE. When their cholesterol content becomes greater than the triglyceride content, they become low-density lipoprotein (LDL), with the primary apolipoprotein being apoB-100. The LDL is taken into a cell via the LDL receptor (endocytosis) where the contents are either stored, used for cell membrane structure, or converted into other products (steroid hormones or bile acids).     [ edit ]   VLDL and disease   VLDL levels have been correlated with accelerated rates of  atherosclerosis , and are elevated in a number of diseases and metabolic states.

ICD - 9   272.0 - 272.4       DiseasesDB   6255       MeSH   D006949       Hyperlipidemia ,  hyperlipoproteinemia  or  dyslipidemia  is the presence of raised or abnormal levels of  lipids  and/or  lipoproteins  in the  blood . Lipids (fatty molecules) are transported in a  protein  capsule, and the density of the lipids and type of protein determines the fate of the particle and its influence on  metabolism .   Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are extremely common in the general population, and are regarded as a highly modifiable risk factor for  cardiovascular disease  due to the influence of  cholesterol , one of the most clinically relevant lipid substances, on  atherosclerosis . In addition, some forms may predispose to  acute pancreatitis .

[ 1 ]  It was later adopted by the  World Health Organization  (WHO). It does not directly account for  HDL , and it does not distinguish among the different  genes  that may be partially responsible for some of these conditions. It remains a popular system of classification, but is considered dated by many.

Lipoprotein lipase is also responsible for the initial breakdown of endogenously made triacylglycerides in the form of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). As such, one would expect a defect in LPL to also result in elevated VLDL. Its prevalence is 0.1% of the population.     [ edit ]   Hyperlipoproteinemia type II   Hyperlipoproteinemia type II, by far the most common form, is further classified into type IIa and type IIb, depending mainly on whether there is elevation in the triglyceride level in addition to LDL cholesterol.     [ edit ]   Type IIa   Main article:  Familial hypercholesterolemia   This may be sporadic (due to dietary factors), polygenic, or truly familial as a result of a mutation either in the  LDL receptor  gene on  chromosome 19  (0.2% of the population) or the  ApoB  gene (0.2%). The familial form is characterized by  tendon xanthoma ,  xanthelasma  and premature cardiovascular disease. The incidence of this disease is about 1 in 500 for heterozygotes, and 1 in 1,000,000 for homozygotes.     [ edit ]   Type IIb   The high VLDL levels are due to overproduction of substrates, including triglycerides, acetyl CoA, and an increase in B-100 synthesis. They may also be caused by the decreased clearance of LDL. Prevalence in the population is 10%.     Familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia (FCH)   Secondary combined hyperlipoproteinemia (usually in the context of  metabolic syndrome , for which it is a diagnostic criterion)       [ edit ]   Treatment   While dietary modification is the initial approach, many patients require treatment with  statins  (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) to reduce cardiovascular risk. If the triglyceride level is markedly raised,  fibrates  may be preferable due to their beneficial effects. Combination treatment of statins and fibrates, while highly effective, causes a markedly increased risk of  myopathy  and  rhabdomyolysis  and is therefore only done under close supervision. Other agents commonly added to statins are  ezetimibe ,  niacin  and  bile acid sequestrants . There is some evidence for benefit of plant sterol-containing products and   3 -fatty acids [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Hyperlipoproteinemia type III   This form is due to high  chylomicrons  and IDL (intermediate density lipoprotein). Also known as  broad beta disease  or  dysbetalipoproteinemia , the most common cause for this form is the presence of  ApoE  E2/E2 genotype. It is due to cholesterol-rich VLDL (-VLDL). Prevalence is 0.02% of the population.     [ edit ]   Hyperlipoproteinemia type IV (type 4 = familial)   This form is due to high  triglycerides . It is also known as  hypertriglyceridemia  (or  pure hypertriglyceridemia ). According to the NCEP-ATPIII definition of high triglycerides (>200 mg/dl), prevalence is about 16% of adult population. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Hyperlipoproteinemia type V (type 5 = endogenous)   This type is very similar to type I, but with high  VLDL  in addition to chylomicrons.   It is also associated with glucose intolerance and hyperuricemia     [ edit ]   Unclassified forms   Non-classified forms are extremely rare:     Hypo-alpha lipoproteinemia   Hypo-beta lipoproteinemia (prevalence 0.01-0.1%)       [ edit ]   References       ^  Frederickson DS, Lee RS.

B lymphocytes are the cells of the immune system that make antibodies to invading pathogens like viruses. They form memory cells that remember the same pathogen for faster antibody production in future infections.       Memory B cells  are a  B cell  sub-type that are formed following primary infection.     [ edit ]   Primary response, paratopes, and epitopes   In wake of first (primary response) infection involving a particular  antigen , the responding nave (ones which have never been exposed to the antigen) cells proliferate to produce a  colony  of cells, most of which differentiate into the  plasma cells  or the effector B cells (which produce the  antibodies ) and clear away with the resolution of infection, and the rest persist as the memory cells that can survive for years, or even a lifetime.   To understand the events taking place, it is important to appreciate that the antibody molecules present on a clone (a group of genetically identical cells) of B cells have a unique  paratope  (the sequence of amino acids that binds to the  epitope  on an antigen).   And, each time these cells are induced to proliferate due to an infection, the genetic region coding for the paratope undergoes spontaneous  mutations  with a frequency of about 1 in every 1600 cell-divisions (this is a very high frequency considering the frequency with which these cells divide; compare with frequency of mutations in other cells--1 in 10 6 ).     [ edit ]   Secondary response and memory   All these events occur in the highly ""eventful"" germinal centers of lymphoid follicles, within the  lymph nodes .   Some of the resulting paratopes (and the cells elaborating them) have a better affinity for the antigen (actually, the  epitope ) and are more likely to proliferate than the others (not unlike  Charles Darwin 's concept of "" natural selection "").   Moreover, with each such exposure to the antigen the number of different clones responding to the same antigen increase ( polyclonal response ), and a greater number of memory cells persist. Thus, a stronger (basically, larger number of antibody molecules) and more specific antibody-production are the hallmarks of secondary antibody response.   The facts that all the cells of a single clone elaborate one and only one paratope, and that the memory cells survive for long periods, are what impart a ""memory"" to the immune response.   This is the principle behind  vaccination  and administration of booster doses.

Latin   articulatio temporomandibularis       Gray's   subject #75       Artery   superficial temporal artery       Nerve   auriculotemporal nerve ,  masseteric nerve       MeSH   Temporomandibular+Joint       The  temporomandibular joint  is the joint of the  jaw  and is frequently referred to as  TMJ . There are two TMJs, one on either side, working in unison. The name is derived from the two bones which form the  joint : the upper  temporal bone  which is part of the  cranium  ( skull ), and the lower jaw bone called the  mandible . The unique feature of the TMJs is the  articular disc . The disc is composed of fibrocartilagenous tissue (like the firm and flexible  elastic cartilage  of the ear) which is positioned between the two bones that form the joint. The TMJs are one of the only  synovial joints  in the human body with an  articular disc , another being the  sternoclavicular joint . The disc divides each joint into two. The lower joint compartment formed by the mandible and the articular disc is involved in  rotational  movement (opening and closing movements). The upper joint compartment formed by the articular disk and the temporal bone is involved in  translational  movements (sliding the lower jaw forward or side to side). The part of the mandible which mates to the under-surface of the disc is the  condyle  and the part of the temporal bone which mates to the upper surface of the disk is the glenoid (or mandibular)  fossa .   Pain or dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint is commonly referred to as ""TMJ"", when in fact, TMJ is really the name of the joint, and  Temporomandibular joint disorder  (or  dysfunction ) is abbreviated TMD. This term is used to refer to a group of problems involving the TMJs and the muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and other tissues associated with them. Some practitioners might include the neck, the back and even the whole body in describing problems with the TMJs.           Contents       1   Articulation   2   Components     2.1   Capsule and articular disc   2.2   Ligaments       3   Innervation and vascularization   4   Jaw movements   5   Disorders   6   External links               [ edit ]   Articulation   The TMJ is a  ginglymoarthrodial joint , referring to its dual compartment structure and function ( ginglymo-  and  arthrodial ).   The condyle articulates with the  temporal bone  in the  mandibular fossa . The mandibular fossa is a concave depression in the  squamous portion of the temporal bone .   These two bones are actually separated by an  articular disc , which divides the TMJ into two distinct compartments. The  inferior compartment  allows for pure  rotation  of the condylar head, which corresponds to the first 20 mm or so of the opening of the mouth. After the mouth is open to this extent, the mouth can no longer open without the  superior compartment  of the TMJ becoming active.   At this point, if the mouth continues to open, not only is the condylar head rotating within the lower compartment of the TMJ, but the entire apparatus (condylar head and articular disc)  translates , or slides, forward in the glenoid fossa and down the articular eminence of the temporal bone, thus incorporating an anterior movement into the further opening of the mouth. This can be demonstrated by placing a resistance fist against the chin and trying to open the mouth more than 20 or so mm.     [ edit ]   Components   There are six main components of the TMJ.     Mandibular condyles   Articular surface of the temporal bone   Capsule   Articular disc   Ligaments   Lateral pterygoid       [ edit ]   Capsule and articular disc   The capsule is a fibrous membrane that surrounds the joint and incorporates the  articular eminence . It attaches to the articular eminence, the articular disc and the neck of the mandibular condyle.   The articular disc is a fibrous extension of the capsule in between the two bones of the joint. The disk functions as articular surfaces against both the temporal bone and the condyles and divides the joint into two sections, as described in more detail below. It is biconcave in structure and attaches to the  condyle  medially and laterally. The anterior portion of the disc splits in the vertical dimension, coincident with the insertion of the superior head of the lateral pterygoid. The posterior portion also splits in the vertical dimension, and the area between the split continues posteriorly and is referred to as the  retrodiscal tissue . Unlike the disc itself, this piece of connective tissue is vascular and innervated, and in some cases of  anterior disc displacement , the pain felt during movement of the mandible is due to the condyle pressing on this area.     [ edit ]   Ligaments   There are three ligaments associated with the TMJ: one major and two minor ligaments.     The major ligament, the  temporomandibular ligament , is really the thickened lateral portion of the capsule, and it has two parts: an  outer oblique portion  ( OOP ) and an  inner horizontal portion  ( IHP ).       The minor ligaments, the stylomandibular and sphenomandibular ligaments are accessory and are not directly attached to any part of the joint.    The  stylomandibular ligament  separates the infratemporal region (anterior) from the  parotid  region (posterior), and runs from the  styloid process  to the  angle of the mandible .   The  sphenomandibular ligament  runs from the  spine of the sphenoid bone  to the  lingula of mandible .         These ligaments are important in that they define the border movements, or in other words, the farthest extents of movements, of the mandible. However, movements of the mandible made past the extents functionally allowed by the muscular attachments will result in painful stimuli, and thus, movements past these more limited borders are rarely achieved in normal function.     [ edit ]   Innervation and vascularization   Sensory innervation of the temporomandibular joint is derived from the  auriculotemporal  and  masseteric  branches of  V 3  (otherwise known as the mandibular branch of the  trigeminal nerve ). These are only sensory innervation, recall that motor is to the muscles.   Its arterial blood supply is provided by branches of the  external carotid artery , predominately the  superficial temporal branch . Other branches of the external carotid artery namely: the  deep auricular artery ,  anterior tympanic artery ,  ascending pharyngeal artery , and  maxillary artery - may also contribute to the arterial blood supply of the joint.   The specific mechanics of proprioception in the temporomandibular joint involve four receptors.  Ruffini endings  function as static  mechanoreceptors  which position the mandible.  Pacinian corpuscles  are dynamic mechanoreceptors which accelerate movement during reflexes.  Golgi tendon organs  function as static mechanoreceptors for protection of ligaments around the temporomandibular joint.  Free nerve endings  are the pain receptors for protection of the temporomandibular joint itself.   In order to work properly, there is neither innervation nor vascularization within the central portion of the articular disc. Had there been any nerve fibers or blood vessels, people would bleed whenever they moved their jaws; however, movement itself would be too painful.     [ edit ]   Jaw movements          Sagittal section of the articulation of the mandible.       During  jaw  movements, only the mandible moves.   Normal movements of the mandible during function, such as  mastication , or chewing, are known as excursions. There are two lateral excursions (left and right) and the forward excursion, known as protrusion. The reversal of protrusion is retrusion.   When the mandible is moved into protrusion, the mandibular  incisors , or front teeth of the mandible, are moved so that they first come edge to edge with the maxillary (upper) incisors and then surpass them, producing a temporary underbite. This is accomplished by translation of the condyle down the articular eminence (in the upper portion of the TMJ) without any more than the slightest amount of rotation taking place (in the lower portion of the TMJ), other than that necessary to allow the mandibular incisors to come in front of the maxillary incisors without running into them. (This is all assuming an ideal  Class I  or  Class II occlusion , which is not entirely important to the lay reader.)   During chewing, the mandible moves in a specific manner as delineated by the two TMJs. The side of the mandible that moves laterally is referred to as either the working or rotating side, while the other side is referred to as either the balancing or orbiting side. The latter terms, although a bit outdated, are actually more precise, as they define the sides by the movements of the respective condyles.   When the mandible is moved into a lateral excursion, the working side condyle (the condyle on the side of the mandible that moves outwards) only performs rotation (in the horizontal plane), while the balancing side condyle performs translation. During actual functional chewing, when the teeth are not only moved side to side, but also up and down when biting of the teeth is incorporated as well, rotation (in a vertical plane) also plays a part in both condyles.   The mandible is moved primary by the four muscles of mastication: the  masseter ,  medial pterygoid , lateral pterygoid and the  temporalis . These four muscles, all innervated by  V 3 , or the mandibular division of the  trigeminal nerve , work in different groups to move the mandible in different directions. Contraction of the lateral pterygoid acts to pull the disc and condyle forward within the glenoid fossa and down the articular eminence; thus, action of this muscle serves to open the mouth. The other three muscles close the mouth; the masseter and the medial pterygoid by pulling up the angle of the mandible and the temporalis by pulling up on the  coronoid process .     [ edit ]   Disorders     See  Temporomandibular joint disorder  for more details     The most common disorder of the TMJ is  disc displacement . In essence, this is when the articular disc, attached anteriorly to the superior head of the lateral pteygoid muscle and posteriorly to the retrodiscal tissue, moves out from between the condyle and the fossa, so that the mandible and temporal bone contact is made on something other than the articular disc. This, as explained above, is usually very painful, because unlike these adjacent tissues, the central portion of the disc contains no sensory innervation.   In most instances of disorder, the disc is displaced anteriorly upon translation, or the anterior and inferior sliding motion of the condyle forward within the fossa and down the articular eminence. On opening, a ""pop"" or ""click"" can sometimes be heard and usually felt as well, indicating the condyle is moving back onto the disk, known as ""reducing the joint"" ( disc displacement with reduction ). Upon closing, the condyle will slide off the back of the disc, hence another ""click"" or ""pop"" at which point the condyle is posterior to the disc. Upon clenching, the condyle compresses the bilaminar area, and the nerves, arteries and veins against the temporal fossa, causing pain and inflammation.   In  Disc displacement without reduction  the disc stays anterior to the condylar head upon opening. Mouth opening is limited and there is no ""pop"" or ""click"" sound on opening.   TMJ pain is generally due to one of three reasons.     The most common cause of TMJ pain is  myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome , primarily involving the muscles of mastication.   Internal derangements is defined as an abnormal relationship of the disc to any of the other components of the TMJ. Disc displacement is an example of internal derangement.   Degenerative joint disease, otherwise known as  osteoarthritis  is the organic degeneration of the articular surfaces within the TMJ.   TMJ pain remains one of the most reliable diagnostic criteria for  temporal arteritis .       [ edit ]   External links     Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMJD).

A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally. [ 2 ]           Contents       1   Classification     1.1   Structural classification   1.2   Functional classification   1.3   Biomechanical classification   1.4   Anatomical       2   Arthritis   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Classification          Depiction of an intervertebral disk, a cartilaginous joint.              Diagram of a synovial (diarthrosis) joint.       Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.   Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis       Main article:  Arthritis       Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

clueweb09-enwp01-17-00487	"                     Lipoprotein          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Lipid cycle )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                  Lipoprotein structure (chylomicron)   ApoA, ApoB, ApoC, ApoE  ( apolipoproteins );  T  ( triacylglycerol );  C  ( cholesterol ); green ( phospholipids )       A  lipoprotein  is a  biochemical  assembly that contains both  proteins  and  lipids . The lipids or their derivatives may be covalently or non-covalently bound to the proteins. Many  enzymes ,  transporters , structural proteins,  antigens ,  adhesins  and  toxins  are lipoproteins. Examples include the  high density  and  low density  lipoproteins which enable fats to be carried in the  blood  stream, the  transmembrane proteins  of the  mitochondrion  and the  chloroplast , and bacterial lipoproteins  [1] .           Contents       1   Function     1.1   Transmembrane lipoproteins       2   Classification     2.1   By density   2.2   Alpha and beta   2.3   Lipoprotein(a)       3   Metabolism     3.1   Exogenous pathway   3.2   Endogenous pathway       4   References   5   See also   6   External links               [ edit ]   Function   The function of lipoprotein particles is to transport lipids (fats) and cholesterol around the body in the aqueous blood, in which they would not normally dissolve.   All  cells  use and rely on  fats  and, for all  animal  cells,  cholesterol  as building blocks to create the multiple  membranes  which cells use to both control internal water content, internal water soluble elements and to organize their internal structure and protein enzymatic systems.   The lipoprotein particles have  hydrophilic  groups of phospholipids, cholesterol and apoproteins directed outward; this makes them soluble in the salt water based blood pool. Triglyceride-fats and cholesterol esters are carried internally, shielded from the water by the phospholipid monolayer and the apoproteins.   The interaction of the proteins forming the surface of the particles with (a) enzymes in the blood, (b) with each other and (c) with specific proteins on the surfaces of cells, determine whether triglycerides and cholesterol will be added to or removed from the lipoprotein transport particles.   Regarding  atheroma  development and progression vs. regression, the key issue has always been cholesterol transport patterns, not cholesterol concentration itself.     [ edit ]   Transmembrane lipoproteins   The lipids are often an essential part of the complex, even if they seem to have no catalytic activity themselves. To isolate transmembrane lipoproteins from their associated  membranes ,  detergents  are often needed.     [ edit ]   Classification     [ edit ]   By density   General categories of lipoproteins, listed in order from larger and less dense (more fat than protein) to smaller and denser (more protein, less fat):     Chylomicrons  - carry  triacylglycerol  (fat) from the  intestines  to the  liver ,  skeletal muscle , and to  adipose tissue .   Very low density lipoproteins  (VLDL) - carry (newly synthesised)  triacylglycerol  from the liver to adipose tissue.   Intermediate density lipoproteins  (IDL) - are intermediate between VLDL and LDL. They are not usually detectable in the blood.   Low density lipoproteins  (LDL) - carry cholesterol from the liver to cells of the body. Sometimes referred to as the ""bad cholesterol"" lipoprotein.   High density lipoproteins  (HDL) - collects cholesterol from the body's tissues, and brings it back to the liver. Sometimes referred to as the ""good cholesterol"" lipoprotein.

This terminology is sometimes used in describing lipid disorders such as  Abetalipoproteinemia .     [ edit ]   Lipoprotein(a)   Lipoprotein(a) - Lp(a), Cardiology diagnostic tests     < 14 mg/dL : Normal   14-19 mg/dL : ?   > 19 mg/dL : High risk     How to lower:  aerobic exercise ,  niacin ,  aspirin ,  guggulipid .  [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Metabolism   The handling of lipoproteins in the body is referred to as lipoprotein metabolism. It is divided into two pathways, exogenous and endogenous, depending in large part on whether the lipoproteins in question are composed chiefly of dietary (exogenous) lipids or whether they originated in the liver (endogenous).     [ edit ]   Exogenous pathway   Epithelial cells  lining the  small intestine  readily absorb lipids from the diet. These lipids, including triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol, are assembled with  apolipoprotein B-48  into  chylomicrons . These nascent chylomicrons are secreted from the intestinal epithelial cells into the  lymphatic circulation  in a process that depends heavily on apolipoprotein B-48. As they circulate through the lymphatic vessels, nascent chylomicrons bypass the liver circulation and are drained via the thoracic duct into the bloodstream.   In the bloodstream, HDL particles donate  apolipoprotein C-II  and  apolipoprotein E  to the nascent chylomicron; the chylomicron is now considered mature. Via apolipoprotein C-II, mature chylomicrons activate  lipoprotein lipase  (LPL), an enzyme on  endothelial cells  lining the blood vessels. LPL catalyzes a  hydrolysis  reaction that ultimately releases  glycerol  and  fatty acids  from the chylomicrons. Glycerol and fatty acids can be absorbed in peripheral tissues, especially  adipose  and  muscle , for energy and storage.   The hydrolyzed chylomicrons are now considered chylomicron remnants. The chylomicron remnants continue circulating until they interact via apolipoprotein E with  chylomicron remnant receptors , found chiefly in the liver. This interaction causes the  endocytosis  of the chylomicron remnants, which are subsequently hydrolyzed within  lysosomes . Lysosomal hydrolysis releases glycerol and fatty acids into the cell, which can be used for energy or stored for later use.     [ edit ]   Endogenous pathway   The liver is another important source of lipoproteins, principally VLDL. Triacylglycerol and cholesterol are assembled with  apolipoprotein B-100  to form VLDL particles. Nascent VLDL particles are released into the bloodstream via a process that depends upon apolipoprotein B-100.   As in chylomicron metabolism, the  apolipoprotein C-II  and  apolipoprotein E  of VLDL particles are acquired from HDL particles. Once loaded with apolipoproteins C-II and E, the nascent VLDL particle is considered mature.   Again like chylomicrons, VLDL particles circulate and encounter LPL expressed on endothelial cells. Apolipoprotein C-II activates LPL, causing hydrolysis of the VLDL particle and the release of glycerol and fatty acids. These products can be absorbed from the blood by peripheral tissues, principally adipose and muscle. The hydrolyzed VLDL particles are now called VLDL remnants or  intermediate density lipoproteins  (IDLs). VLDL remnants can circulate and, via an interaction between apolipoprotein E and the remnant receptor, be absorbed by the liver, or they can be further hydrolyzed by  hepatic lipase .   Hydrolysis by hepatic lipase releases glycerol and fatty acids, leaving behind IDL remnants, called  low density lipoproteins  (LDL), which contain a relatively high cholesterol content. LDL circulates and is absorbed by the liver and peripheral cells. Binding of LDL to its target tissue occurs through an interaction between the  LDL receptor  and apolipoprotein B-100 or E on the LDL particle. Absorption occurs through  endocytosis , and the internalized LDL particles are hydrolyzed within lysosomes, releasing lipids, chiefly cholesterol.

In  human anatomy , the  subtalar joint , also known as the  talocalcaneal joint , is a  joint  of the  foot . It occurs at the meeting point of the  talus  and the  calcaneus .           Contents       1   Motion   2   Relation of bones   3   Ligaments and membranes   4   Sources   5   Additional images   6   External links               [ edit ]   Motion   The joint allows  inversion  and  eversion  of the foot, but plays no role in  dorsiflexion  or  plantarflexion  of the foot. [ 1 ]   It is considered a plane synovial joint  [ 2 ] , also commonly referred to as uniaxial hinge joint.     [ edit ]   Relation of bones   The talus is oriented slightly obliquely on the anterior surface of the calcaneus.   There are two points of articulation between the two bones: one anteriorly and one posteriorly:     At the  anterior talocalcaneal articulation , a  convex  area of the talus fits on a  concave  surface of the calcaneus.   The  posterior talocalcaneal articulation  is formed by a concave surface of the talus and a convex surface of the calcaneus.     The subtalar joint contributes to 10% of dorsiflexion of the ankle.     [ edit ]   Ligaments and membranes   The main  ligament  of the joint is the  interosseous talocalcaneal ligament , a thick, strong band of two partially joined fibers that bind the talus and calcaneus. It runs through the  sinus tarsi , a canal between the articulations of the two bones.   There are four additional ligaments that form weaker connections between the talus and calcaneus.     The  anterior talocalcaneal ligament  (or anterior interosseous ligament) attaches at the neck of the talus on the front and lateral surfaces to the superior calcaneus.       The short band of the  posterior talocalcaneal ligament  extends from the lateral tubercle of the talus to the upper medial calcaneus.       The short, strong  lateral talocalcaneal ligament  connects from the lateral talus under the fibular facet to the lateral calcaneus, and runs parallel to the  calcaneofibular ligament .       The  medial talocalcaneal ligament  extends from the medial tubercle of the talus to the  sustentaculum tali  on the medial surface of the calcaneus.     A  synovial membrane  lines the capsule of the joint, and the joint is wrapped in a capsule of short fibers that are continuous with the talocalconeonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints of the foot.

A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally. [ 2 ]           Contents       1   Classification     1.1   Structural classification   1.2   Functional classification   1.3   Biomechanical classification   1.4   Anatomical       2   Arthritis   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Classification          Depiction of an intervertebral disk, a cartilaginous joint.              Diagram of a synovial (diarthrosis) joint.       Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.   Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis       Main article:  Arthritis       Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

For example, the joint that allows humans to  rotate  their heads on their necks is a pivot joint.           Contents       1   Biology   2   Mechanics   3   References   4   External links               [ edit ]   Biology   Pivot joints are found in humans in the  neck , fore arms ,  knees , and other parts of the  skeletal system  that are able to  rotate .   A pivot joint in biology is composed of a bone and ligament ring rotating around another bone.     [ edit ]   Mechanics   Pivot joints are used in  mechanics  for things such as windshield wipers. They are useful for machines that have to rotate in order to complete their job.

A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally.

Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.   Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis       Main article:  Arthritis       Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

VLDL is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins ( chylomicrons ,  VLDL ,  IDL ,  LDL ,  HDL ) which enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water based solution of the blood stream. It is assembled in the  liver  from  cholesterol  and  apolipoproteins . It is converted in the bloodstream to  low-density lipoprotein  (LDL). VLDL particles have a diameter of 30-80  nm . VLDL transports endogenous products where  chylomicrons  transport exogenous (dietary) products.           Contents       1   Function   2   Changes during circulation   3   VLDL and disease   4   See also               [ edit ]   Function   VLDL transports endogenous triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. It functions as the body's internal transport mechanism for lipids.     [ edit ]   Changes during circulation   Nascent VLDL circulates in blood and picks up  apolipoprotein C-II  and  apolipoprotein E  donated from  High-Density Lipoprotein  (HDL). At this point, the nascent VLDL becomes a mature VLDL. Once in circulation, the VLDL will come in contact with  lipoprotein lipase  (LPL) in the capillary beds in the body (adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle). The LPL will remove triglycerides from the VLDL for storage or energy production.   The VLDL now meets back up with HDL where apoC-II is transferred back to the HDL (but keeps apoE). In addition to this, the HDL transfers cholesteryl esters to the VLDL in exchange for phospholipids and triglycerides (via  cholesteryl ester transfer protein ).   As more and more triglycerides are removed from the VLDL because of the action of the LPL enzyme, the composition of the molecule changes, and it becomes intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL).   50% of IDL are recognized by receptors in the liver cells (because of the  apoB-100  and apoE they contain) and are  endocytosed .   The other 50% of IDL lose their apoE. When their cholesterol content becomes greater than the triglyceride content, they become low-density lipoprotein (LDL), with the primary apolipoprotein being apoB-100. The LDL is taken into a cell via the LDL receptor (endocytosis) where the contents are either stored, used for cell membrane structure, or converted into other products (steroid hormones or bile acids).     [ edit ]   VLDL and disease   VLDL levels have been correlated with accelerated rates of  atherosclerosis , and are elevated in a number of diseases and metabolic states.   The uniqueness of this correlation is disputed by Harchaoui and Boekholdt  http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/551425     [ edit ]   See also     Combined hyperlipidemia                   v    d    e     Lipids :  lipoprotein  metabolism             General     Chylomicron  -  HDL  -  LDL  -  IDL  -  VLDL  -  Lp(a)               Apolipoproteins     APOA ( 1 ,  2 ,  5 ) -  APOB  - APOC ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ) -  APOD  -  APOE  -  APOH               Other     Lipoprotein lipase  - HDL ( Cholesterylester transfer protein ,  Acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase ,  LCAT ) -  LDL receptor  -  Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein  -  ABCA1                 see also  disorders                                       Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low-density_lipoprotein ""      Categories :  Lipoproteins                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                                                Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                   Languages                Deutsch       Suomi       Franais              Nederlands              Trke                                                    This page was last modified on 24 November 2008, at 00:00.

Here are pictures taken of a  dissected knee and hip from a deer  (thanks to Kathy and Andy):   Here are  images of recently purchased joint models .     SYNOVIAL JOINT FEATURES:     These are common to all synovial joints: (Martini's 6th, p 266)                             synovial capsule         A collagenous structure which encloses, supports and protects the joint.                 It often incorporates ligaments into its walls.                     synovial membrane         Forms the inner lining of capsule, secretes synovial fluid                     articular cartilage         Hyaline cartilage padding on the articulating surfaces of joined bones                     synovial fluid         A lubricating, nourishing fluid rich in mucopolysaccharide.

A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally.

Diagram of a synovial (diarthrosis) joint.       Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.   Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis   Main article:  Arthritis   Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally.

Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones.

Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis       Main article:  Arthritis       Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally.

Diagram of a synovial (diarthrosis) joint.       Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.   Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis   Main article:  Arthritis   Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally.

Diagram of a synovial (diarthrosis) joint.       Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.   Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis   Main article:  Arthritis   Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

Lipids (fatty molecules) are transported in a  protein  capsule, and the density of the lipids and type of protein determines the fate of the particle and its influence on  metabolism .   Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are extremely common in the general population, and are regarded as a highly modifiable risk factor for  cardiovascular disease  due to the influence of  cholesterol , one of the most clinically relevant lipid substances, on  atherosclerosis . In addition, some forms may predispose to  acute pancreatitis .

[ 1 ]  It was later adopted by the  World Health Organization  (WHO). It does not directly account for  HDL , and it does not distinguish among the different  genes  that may be partially responsible for some of these conditions. It remains a popular system of classification, but is considered dated by many.

Lipoprotein lipase is also responsible for the initial breakdown of endogenously made triacylglycerides in the form of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). As such, one would expect a defect in LPL to also result in elevated VLDL. Its prevalence is 0.1% of the population.     [ edit ]   Hyperlipoproteinemia type II   Hyperlipoproteinemia type II, by far the most common form, is further classified into type IIa and type IIb, depending mainly on whether there is elevation in the triglyceride level in addition to LDL cholesterol.     [ edit ]   Type IIa   Main article:  Familial hypercholesterolemia   This may be sporadic (due to dietary factors), polygenic, or truly familial as a result of a mutation either in the  LDL receptor  gene on  chromosome 19  (0.2% of the population) or the  ApoB  gene (0.2%). The familial form is characterized by  tendon xanthoma ,  xanthelasma  and premature cardiovascular disease. The incidence of this disease is about 1 in 500 for heterozygotes, and 1 in 1,000,000 for homozygotes.     [ edit ]   Type IIb   The high VLDL levels are due to overproduction of substrates, including triglycerides, acetyl CoA, and an increase in B-100 synthesis. They may also be caused by the decreased clearance of LDL. Prevalence in the population is 10%.     Familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia (FCH)   Secondary combined hyperlipoproteinemia (usually in the context of  metabolic syndrome , for which it is a diagnostic criterion)       [ edit ]   Treatment   While dietary modification is the initial approach, many patients require treatment with  statins  (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) to reduce cardiovascular risk. If the triglyceride level is markedly raised,  fibrates  may be preferable due to their beneficial effects. Combination treatment of statins and fibrates, while highly effective, causes a markedly increased risk of  myopathy  and  rhabdomyolysis  and is therefore only done under close supervision. Other agents commonly added to statins are  ezetimibe ,  niacin  and  bile acid sequestrants . There is some evidence for benefit of plant sterol-containing products and   3 -fatty acids [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Hyperlipoproteinemia type III   This form is due to high  chylomicrons  and IDL (intermediate density lipoprotein). Also known as  broad beta disease  or  dysbetalipoproteinemia , the most common cause for this form is the presence of  ApoE  E2/E2 genotype. It is due to cholesterol-rich VLDL (-VLDL). Prevalence is 0.02% of the population.     [ edit ]   Hyperlipoproteinemia type IV (type 4 = familial)   This form is due to high  triglycerides . It is also known as  hypertriglyceridemia  (or  pure hypertriglyceridemia ). According to the NCEP-ATPIII definition of high triglycerides (>200 mg/dl), prevalence is about 16% of adult population. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Hyperlipoproteinemia type V (type 5 = endogenous)   This type is very similar to type I, but with high  VLDL  in addition to chylomicrons.   It is also associated with glucose intolerance and hyperuricemia     [ edit ]   Unclassified forms   Non-classified forms are extremely rare:     Hypo-alpha lipoproteinemia   Hypo-beta lipoproteinemia (prevalence 0.01-0.1%)       [ edit ]   References       ^  Frederickson DS, Lee RS.
