The  American Civil War  (18611865) was a  civil war  between the  United States of America  (the "" Union "") and the  Southern   slave states  of the newly-formed  Confederate States of America  under  Jefferson Davis . The Union included all of the  free states  and the five slaveholding  border states  and was led by  Abraham Lincoln  and the  Republican Party . Republicans opposed the expansion of  slavery  into territories owned by the United States, and their victory in the  presidential election of 1860  resulted in seven Southern states declaring their  secession  from the Union even before Lincoln took office. [ 1 ]  The Union rejected secession, regarding it as  rebellion .

Battle of Gettysburg - Day One The Battle of Gettysburg was the costliest battle of the Civil War in terms of overall casualties. It was also a major victory for the North. Read about the first day of the battle, July 1, 1863.   Chronological list of Civil War Battles This informative list from Don & Lois Harvey lists each battles and casualty totals for every battle where there was at least one casualty. I have started you off on the 1861 section, from which easy access to the other years is available.   Civil War Battles by State The first page you come to is an overall map pinpointing the individual battles that occurred in the U.S. Civil War.  Under Civil War State Battle Maps you can find all of the battles broken down by state with detailed information concerning participants, casualties, outcomes and more.   Altoona Pass The percentage of participants/casualties was unusually high for the late 1864 Georgia battle. Another nice piece of work from Randy Golden for the ""Welcome to North Georgia"" site.   Battle of Brandy Station--Culpepper, Virginia Some 19,000 mounted men were engaged in this, the greatest cavalry battle ever to take place in the western hemisphere. For the first time in the Civil War, Union cavalry matched the Confederate horsemen in skill and determination.   Chancellorsville: Rumble On the Rappahannok Andrew Dehart's excellent site on this important 1863 battle during which the South suffers a devastating loss with the death of Stonewall Jackson.   Chattanooga Here is the National Park service site on Chattanooga and Chickamauga.   Chickamauga The site of this costly battle ironically translates to ""River of Blood"". Another one of the great ""Blue and Grey Trail"" articles for the North Georgia web site. With nice photos and user-friendly maps.   Battle of Second Manassas The Battle of Second Manassas in August 1862, covering three days, produced 3,399 killed, and brought the Confederacy to the height of its power. The work done on this site by civilwarhome.com gives a brief background, and various articles and reports from those who were there.   The Battle of Olustee The largest Civil War battle in Florida, in proportion to the number of troops involved, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War.   Siege of Petersburg Jim Epperson's monumental web site about this massive assault on this crucial site in the Confederacy. I have linked to the ""Petersburg--Why?"" as the intro to the other sections. Includes pictures and maps.   Shiloh Shiloh is a Hebrew word meaning ""place of peace"". It was anything but that in April 1862. More men died in this battle than at the Battle of Waterloo, and was a decisive battle in the war. This brief summary of the battle is from Lee Bruce.                       Free American History Newsletter!

McClellan confronted Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia at Sharpsburg, Maryland. At dawn September 17, Hooker’s corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee’s left flank that began the single bloodiest day in American military history. Attacks and counterattacks swept across Miller’s cornfield and fighting swirled around the Dunker Church. Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center, but the Federal advantage was not followed up. Late in the day, Burnside’s corps finally got into action, crossing the stone bridge over Antietam Creek and rolling up the Confederate right. At a crucial moment, A.P. Hill’s division arrived from Harpers Ferry and counterattacked, driving back Burnside and saving the day. Although outnumbered two-to-one, Lee committed his entire force, while McClellan sent in less than three-quarters of his army, enabling Lee to fight the Federals to a standstill. During the night, both armies consolidated their lines. In spite of crippling casualties, Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout the 18th, while removing his wounded south of the river. McClellan did not renew the assaults. After dark, Lee ordered the battered Army of Northern Virginia to withdraw across the Potomac into the Shenandoah Valley.

Lee renewed his attacks against Porter’s V Corps, which had established a strong defensive line behind Boatswain’s Swamp north of the Chickahominy River. Porter’s reinforced V Corps held fast for the afternoon against disjointed Confederate attacks, inflicting heavy casualties. At dusk, the Confederates finally mounted a coordinated assault that broke Porter’s line and drove his soldiers back toward the river. The Federals retreated across the river during the night.

Overview of the Battle :  During the Atlanta Campaign, Sherman maneuvered Johnston's Confederate army out of several successive defensive positions in Cobb County. This strategy spared the Union army from making costly frontal attacks on the well-situated Confederates.  Sherman first found Johnston's army entrenched in the Marietta area on June 9. The Confederate's had established defensive lines along Brushy, Pine, and Lost Mountains. Sherman extended his forces beyond the Confederate lines, causing a partial Rebel withdrawal to another line of positions. After further pressure and skirmishing from Union forces, Johnston withdrew to an arc-shaped position centered on Kennesaw Mountain on June 18 and 19. Sherman made some unsuccessful attacks on this position but eventually extended the line on his right and forced Johnston to withdrawal from the Marietta area on July 2-3.

clueweb09-en0002-04-33228	"                     Gettysburg Address          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 The Gettysburg Address at the  Lincoln Memorial  in  Washington, D.C.       The  Gettysburg Address  is a  speech  given by  U.S. President   Abraham Lincoln . It was delivered at the  Soldiers' National Cemetery  in  Gettysburg ,  Pennsylvania , on November 19, 1863, during the  American Civil War , about four months after the North defeated the South at the  Battle of Gettysburg .     [ change ]   The speech   These are the actual words to the Gettysburg Address:     Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.       Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.       But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicatewe can not consecratewe can not hallowthis ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us  that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion  that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain  that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom  and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.       [ change ]   What the Gettysburg Address means   This is a simple version of the Gettysburg Address:     Eighty-seven (87) years ago , the European settlers on  this continent  created  a new nation , created in liberty, and dedicated to the idea that all people are created equal.       At this time , our country is involved in  a big internal war , which will find out if this nation (or any other nation which was created for the same reasons and dedicated to the same ideas) gets to survive. A great battle of that war occurred in the area where we are meeting here today. We are here to dedicate a part of it as a cemetery for the soldiers who died so that our nation could continue to live. It is right and good for us to do this.       But, when you think about it, we cannot dedicate or bless this ground. The brave people, living and dead, who fought here, have already blessed this place more than we will ever be able to. The world might not care about or remember what we say here, but it will never forget what they did here.       Instead, it is the job of us who are still alive to support the unfinished work which those who fought here honorably continued. Here, inspired by their example, we must dedicate ourselves to keeping the ideals this nation began with.       We resolve:     that our soldiers shall not have died in vain   that our nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and   that our government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not vanish from this earth           [ change ]   See also     http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address               Retrieved from "" http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address ""      Categories :  American Civil War  |  1863                                   Views                   Page        Talk        Change this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Getting around                Main Page       Community portal       Simple talk       New changes       Show any page       Help       Give to Wikipedia                    Search                                                Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Special pages       Page for printing      Permanent link Cite this page                   In other languages                J;30@A:8       Catal       Cymraeg       Dansk       Deutsch       English       Espaol       Esperanto       A'13       Franais       Gaeilge       \m       Interlingua       Italiano                     Latvieau       Nederlands       ,       *Norsk (bokml),       Polski       Portugus       Romn        CAA:89       Suomi       Svenska       Ting Vit       -                                                    This page was last changed on 5 January 2009, at 03:06.

clueweb09-en0009-71-23796	"                   Gettysburg Address             by Darrielle       On November 19, 1863, President Lincoln gave a speech at     Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The speech was given at the place where the Battle of Gettysburg     took place. People had gathered at the battlefield to dedicate part of it to the men who     had been killed in battle.       Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is remembered as one of the     best speeches ever given. It was short and simple. People could understand it. It was very     moving. The first part of Lincoln's speech is familiar to most people. He began his speech     by saying:                         "" Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought         forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the         proposition that all men are created equal.""                     Lincoln's Gettysburg Address says that our ancestors created     a new country in North America. They believed in the idea that people are created equal.     Now that there is a great war, we are setting apart some of the battlefield as a cemetery.     The soldiers who fought here have made it holy. Their sacrifice makes us firm in our     struggle. We must make sure that the deaths of the soldiers accomplish something.       Government by the people is for the good of the people and     it will continue.

clueweb09-en0010-27-06729	                     Four score and seven years ago  our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation,   conceived in liberty   and dedicated to the proposition   that all men are created equal.           Now we are engaged in a great civil war,   testing whether that nation   or any nation so conceived and so dedicated   can long endure.      We are met on a great battlefield of that war.      We have come to dedicate a portion of that field   as a final resting-place   for those who here gave their lives   that that nation might live.      It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.   But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate,   we cannot consecrate,   we cannot hallow this ground.      The brave men, living and dead   who struggled here have consecrated it   far above our poor power to add or detract.   The world will little note   nor long remember what we say here,   but it can never forget what they did here.      It is for us the living rather   to be dedicated here to the unfinished work   which they who fought here   have thus far so nobly advanced.      It is rather for us to be here   dedicated to the great task remaining before us  that from these honored dead   we take increased devotion to that cause   for which they gave the last full measure of devotion  that we here highly resolve   that these dead shall not have died in vain,   that this nation   under God   shall have a new birth of freedom,     and that government of the people,   by the people,   for the people   shall not perish from the earth.

Exact  numbers have been impossible to  ascertain in many  instances, but over  the years historians have come to agree  on general  estimates:        More than 2,000,000 soldiers and  sailors  fought for the North during the Civil  War, while  fewer than 750,000  men fought for the South.    Union deaths during the war totaled  more than  360,000 men, fewer than a third of which  were combat  related. Most  of the dead succumbed to diseases, of  which  diarrhea was the most deadly, accounting  for more  than 44,500 deaths.    Figures for the almost 200,000  Northern black  soldiers are even more startling. More  than 29,000  died of disease,  while only 2,751 succumbed to combat  related  causes.    Confederate deaths have been  calculated as  somewhat fewer than 260,000 men, with  164,000  estimated to have been  caused by disease.    Of the South's 425 generals, 82  percent survived  the war; 92 percent of the North's 583  generals  survived.    More than 30,000 Union soldiers died  while  incarcerated in Confederate  prisons.    More than 26,000 Southerners died in  Union  prisons.    Only 4,084 of the 132,554 Union  sailors died  during the war. Only 1,084 died in  combat, with the  rest killed by  disease or accident. The combat deaths  include 342  scalded to death when their ships'  boilers were  struck by enemy fire  and 308 sailors who drowned. Five  thousand soldiers  in the Union armies drowned during the  war.             There were more than 10,000  battles,  engagements, skirmishes, and other  military events.  In descending order,  the number in each state were recorded  as  follows:           Virginia    2,154 Kentucky  453   Tennessee   1,462 Alabama  336   Missouri    1,162 N.Carolina  313   Arkansas      771 S.Carolina  239   W.Virginia    632 Maryland  203   Louisiana     566 Florida  168   Georgia  549        [Source:  Atlas Editions; Civil War Cards ]                                   E-mail Me At:  w5www@yahoo.com          CLICK HERE TO RETURN TO MAIN PAGE

Plot B'Elanna Torres  is in a good mood, until she arrives at work in Engineering and almost faints.  Icheb  scans her and panics when he thinks she has a parasite within her.  Seven of Nine  also scans Torres and comes up with a different diagnosis: B'Elanna is pregnant. The Doctor  confirms Seven's diagnosis. The fetus is perfectly healthy, except for a genetic defect that causes abnormal spine curvature in  Klingon  females. B'Elanna, who is half Klingon, had surgery as a baby to correct this defect. The Doctor says that nowadays genetic resequencing is the preferred treatment. He performs the procedure the next day. B'Elanna reminisces back to her childhood as a Klingon girl on the colony which she grew up. She blames herself, especially her Klingon half, for her human father leaving her, and resolves to not let the same happen to her daughter. She proposes further genetic resequencing to delete various Klingon genes, but the Doctor and  Tom Paris , B'Elanna's husband, disagree.  During one of the couple's arguments, Torres mentions Voyager has 140 humans on board. This is not intended as a full crew count as other aliens, such as Vulcans, Bolians and Bajorans are also part of the crew. When the Doctor suddenly changes his mind, Tom seeks a second opinion from Icheb (his aptitude for genetics was first referenced in "" Child's Play ""). Icheb disagrees with the Doctor's new assessment and discovers that the EMH's program has been tampered with. Tom stops the procedure in the nick of time, and he and B'Elanna have an argument. She tearfully admits what she fears will happen to her daughter, and Tom reaffirms his commitment to his growing family.   B'Elanna asks the Doctor to be the godfather.   Notes  The doctor's willingness to perform genetic manipulation on the unborn child would seem to be in conflict with the Federation's prohibition on genetic enhancements mentioned in "" Doctor Bashir, I Presume? .""Although in that DS9 episode it is stated the genetic manipulation is only to be used to cure birth defects, which is what this condition is. Also, when the Doctor was going to perform the procedure purging all the Klingon DNA from the child, his programming had been altered so he probably wouldn't have done it if he had been operating normally.

From July 1 to July 3, 1863, Union and Confederate forces clashed in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Battle of Gettysburg, a bloody battle that halted Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North, was a turning point in the Civil War.                   After the dust settled, more than 7,500 soldiers — over three times the population of Gettysburg itself — lay dead on the battlefield. Authorities decided to turn a section of the battleground into a national cemetery in which to inter and honor the Union dead.      The famed orator and politician Edward Everett was invited to speak at the dedication. Almost as an afterthought, President Lincoln was also invited to offer a few poignant remarks, following Everett's main speech.      On November 19, after Everett delivered a two-hour-long oration, President Lincoln stood and offered his Gettysburg Address, a mere 272 words, which began like this:        Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.        A  score,  like a  dozen,  describes a particular quantity — in this case, 20. So ""four score and seven years"" translates to 87 years. This speech was delivered in 1863; 87 years earlier was 1776, the year that the signing of the Declaration of Independence officially declared U.S. independence and ""brought forth on this continent a new nation.""      The remainder of Lincoln's opening paragraph reminds listeners of the creation of the United States, noting that its government was based on the idea of freedom (liberty), and quoting the Preamble to the Declaration of Independence: ""...all men are created equal."" With his opening lines, Lincoln frames his speech in a historical and philosophical perspective.        Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.        Keep in mind that, in 1776, the United States was a new kind of country with a different kind of political philosophy. Its formation was known as ""the Great Experiment"" because it ventured into new ground, and no one knew if such a government could survive. That is the idea Lincoln refers to in this section of the speech: The Civil War was testing whether the United States, which was founded on liberty and equality, could survive. Thus, Lincoln succinctly expressed the magnitude of the Civil War: What was at stake was not simply lives, or money, or government control, but the very foundations upon which the United States was founded.        But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.        This last paragraph is the most important part. In the first three sentences, Lincoln acknowledges that anything he or anyone else says at this ceremony are just words, and those words are nothing compared to what the soldiers gave during that battle. He and others came to Gettysburg to dedicate the cemetery ground, but Lincoln turns it around, stating that by struggling and spilling blood and dying on that battlefield, the soldiers themselves have already  dedicated ,  hallowed , and  consecrated  (which all essentially mean ""make something sacred or honored"") the area.      So instead of coming to dedicate the ground, Lincoln says that the people are there to  be dedicated  to ""the unfinished work"" of the devoted soldiers — that is, the preservation of the Union and its ideals of liberty and equality. If the Union were to give up on the Civil War — and many people supported making concessions to the South to end the war — then these soldiers' deaths would be ""in vain,"" or meaningless. This is both a call to action and a justification for continuing the war.      Lincoln's Gettysburg Address became a rallying cry that easily ushered Lincoln into his second term in office and reinforced Union resolve to win the war.

The impassioned defense of the Blackburns by Canada's lieutenant governor set precedents for all future fugitive-slave cases                  Great Maps of the Civil War: Pivotal Battles and Campaigns Featuring 32 Removable Maps        Fifteen chapters in Great Maps of the Civil War each contain two or three maps that can be pulled out of a pocket. Ten of the maps are 18"" x 24""; others are smaller. In addition to a discussion of the battles and the roles of the maps, the book tells about Civil War mapmakers and the methods they used.                  The Gettysburg Gospel: The Lincoln Speech That Nobody Knows        Reconstructs what really happened in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on November 19, 1863.                          Gettysburg Expedition Guide         The CD-ROM is packed with battle map animations, history movies, virtual tours and quiz games. The guidebook and audio tour take you on a tour of the battlefield, complete with battle maps, illustrations and famous photographs.                  Desperate Engagement: How a Little-Known Civil War Battle Saved Washington, D.C., and Changed American History           A full-field engagement between 12,000 battle-hardened Confederate troops led by Early, and some 5,800 Union troops, many of them untested in battle                  A Very Violent Rebel: The Civil War Diary of Ellen Renshaw House         The Siege of Knoxville (November 1863) is covered and Sutherland's footnotes make for good history                  A Battlefield Atlas of the Civil War           Informative text enhanced 24 three-color maps and 30 black/white historical photographs. Compact, comprehensive, ""user friendly"", and providing a narrative history along with a complete cartographic display of the famed American Civil War battle of Gettysburg                            The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era         Published in 1988 to universal acclaim, this single-volume treatment of the Civil War quickly became recognized as the new standard in its field. James M. McPherson, who won the Pulitzer Prize for this book, impressively combines a brisk writing style with an admirable thoroughness. He covers the military aspects of the war in all of the necessary detail, and also provides a helpful framework describing the complex economic, political, and social forces behind the conflict. Perhaps more than any other book, this one belongs on the bookshelf of every Civil War buff.                 The Civil War a Narrative         This beautifully written trilogy of books on the American Civil War is not only a piece of first-rate history, but also a marvelous work of literature. Shelby Foote brings a skilled novelist's narrative power to this great epic. Many know Foote for his prominent role as a commentator on Ken Burns's PBS series about the Civil War. These three books, however, are his legacy. His southern sympathies are apparent: the first volume opens by introducing Confederate President Jefferson Davis, rather than Abraham Lincoln. But they hardly get in the way of the great story Foote tells. This hefty three volume set should be on the bookshelf of any Civil War buff.                 Clara Barton         Civil War Nurse          Comments in Barton's own words from her thoughts and diaries. There were little known facts to keep the interest of the young adult reader, and these facts tied Barton to the historical background.                  Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri During the American Civil War            The state of Missouri witnessed the most widespread, prolonged, and destructive guerrilla fighting in American history. A horrific combination of robbery, arson, torture, murder, and swift and bloody raids on farms and settlements.                American Civil War Book Titles                           Shades of Blue and Gray: An Introductory Military History of the Civil War            The Civil War with an emphasis on contemporary advances in military technology and their effects on behavior in the field. Ulysses Grant was speaking nearly literally when he wrote, ""the iron gauntlet must be used more than the silken glove to destroy the Confederacy""                  The Battle of the Wilderness May 5-6, 1864           Fought in a tangled forest fringing the south bank of the Rapidan River, the Battle of the Wilderness marked the initial engagement in the climactic months of the Civil War in Virginia, and the first encounter between Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee                  Black Confederates and Afro-Yankees in Civil War Virginia           African American life in Virginia, both slave and free, during the civil war, from soldiers who fought in the Confederate and Union armies to those who acted as spies                  Black Masters: A Free Family of Color in the Old South           This book focuses on biracial persons of white/black ancestry. Persons who tend to be dark complected often consider themselves to be black and because the laws of antebellum South Carolina clearly differentiated between whites and free persons who did not fall into the white category                           Small Arms at Gettysburg: Infantry and Cavalry Weapons in America's Greatest Battle         Here we learn that the smoothbore musket, although beloved by some who carried it, sang its swan song, the rifle-musket began to come into its own, and the repeating rifle, although tactically mishandled, gave a glimpse of future promise. This is the story of the weapons and men who carried them into battle during three days in July 1863                 Gettysburg--The First Day           A detailed tactical description of the first day's fighting. The engagements in McPherson Woods, at the Railroad Cuts, on Oak Ridge, on Seminary Ridge, and at Blocher's Knoll, and the retreat of Union forces through Gettysburg                  Courage on Little Round Top: A Historical Novel                   Selected Letters of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, 1865-1914           Known as the hero of Little Round Top and the commanding officer who accepted the Confederates' surrender at Appomattox.                             The Confederate Housewife           Receipts & Remedies, Together with Sundry Suggestions for Garden, Farm, & Plantation             T his receipt book provides for the first time a comprehensive, grass roots picture of what many Confederate housewives faced during those tumultuous years. Substitutes abound, as do ways to preserve food, care for crops and animals, make straw hats and squirrel-skin shoes, and cure everything from cancer to small pox to ingrown toenails                  To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War           Thousands of former slaves flocked to southern cities in search of work, they found the demands placed on them as wage-earners disturbingly similar to those they had faced as slaves: seven-day workweeks, endless labor, and poor treatment                  Mothers of Invention: Women of the Slaveholding South in the American Civil War           When Confederate men marched off to battle, southern women struggled with the new responsibilities of directing farms and plantations, providing for families, and supervising increasingly restive slaves                  She Went to the Field:          Women Soldiers of the Civil War           several substantiated cases of female soldiers during the American Civil War, including Sarah Rosetta Wakeman (aka Private Wakeman, Union); Sarah Emma Edmonds (aka Private Thompson, Union); Loreta Janeta Velazquez (aka Lieutenant Buford, Confederate); and Jennie Hodgers (aka Private Cashier, Union).                            Shiloh and the Western Campaign of 1862         The Battle of Shiloh was one of the most critical battles in American History. Some of the biggest figures of the Civil War - Grant, Sherman, Johnston, Bragg, Beauregard, Buell - they all fought there. As Grant would write in his memoirs, before Shiloh, Americans on both sides of the Mason Dixon line believed that the war could still be a short limited affair.                    Shilol: A Novel by Shelby Foote         One of the best novels of the American Civil War. Foote is able to capture not only the sense of the battle, but the spirit of the soldiers who fought there. A study of the human condition and how it deals with the horrors of war                   Rose O'Neale Greenhow, Civil War Spy      Fearless spy for the Confederacy, glittering Washington hostess, legendary beauty and lover, Rose Greenhow risked everything for the cause she valued more than life itself                Perryville: This Grand Havoc of Battle           On October 8, 1862, Union and Confederate forces clashed near Perryville, Kentucky, in what would be the largest battle ever fought on Kentucky soil.                            Reign of Iron: The Story of the First Battling Ironclads, the Monitor and the Merrimack           The first ironclad ships to fight each other, the Monitor and the Virginia (Merrimack), were the unique products of American design genius                  Wade Hampton: Confederate Warrior to Southern Redeemer           General Wade Hampton was for a time the commander of all Lee's cavalry and at the end of the war was the highest-ranking Confederate cavalry officer                  The Mutiny at Brandy Station: The Last Battle of the Hooker Brigade           The character and actions of men who served the United States Army of the Potomac in 1864                    Brandy Station, Virginia, June 9, 1863: The Largest Cavalry Battle of the Civil War           Major General Joseph ""Fighting Joe"" Hooker. Relieving the disgraced and outmatched Burnside, Hooker reorganized his troops, establishing regular drills, procuring adequate rations and instituting company colors, thereby giving his soldiers back their fighting spirit.                            The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government           Whether we agree with Jefferson Davis or not, knowledge of his point of view is essential to understanding the causes of the Civil War. The forward by McPherson helps to give balance and explanation.                  Jefferson Davis: Unconquerable Heart         Shades of Blue and Gray         No scholar can fail to appreciate Allen's exhaustive research,, nor any layman fail to be amazed at her mass of fact and significant detail                 First Manassas         The soilders story of the battle in their own words rather then hearing the historians perspective of battle we read the privates letter home or the Colonels battle report this book examines Bull Run, the battle for West Virginia, and the battle of Big Bethel                  The Official Virginia Civil War Battlefield Guide           Virginia was host to nearly 1/3rd of all Civil War engagements. This guide covers them all like a mini-history of the war. This guide organizes battles chronologically. Each campaign has a detailed overview, followed by concise descriptions of the individual engagements                            Tainted Breeze: The Great Hanging at Gainesville, Texas, 1862           October 1, 1862, state militia arrested more than two hundred Unionists from five northern counties . At least forty-four prisoners were hanged, others were lynched in neighboring communities                  Sabine Pass: The Confederacy's Thermopylae           Confederate president Jefferson Davis made the claim: ""That battle at Sabine Pass was more remarkable than the battle at Thermopylae."" Sabine Pass was the site of one of the most decisive Civil War battles                  Horse Sweat and Powder Smoke: The First Texas Cavalry in the Civil War           Regimental history from the time the regiment was raised by Colonel McCulloch to defend against indian warriors tor the time the regiment was part of the Confederate Army under the Colonels Buchel and Yager until the end of the Civil War                  Only a Private: A Texan Remembers the Civil War : The Memoirs of William J. Oliphant           A first-hand account of the common soldier's point of view. No colonel or general, William Oliphant was, ""only a private."" His perspective provides a window into Texas during the first days of the Civil War, and first-hand descriptions of battles                            Battle on the Bay:          The Civil War Struggle for Galveston           Civil War history of Galveston is one of the last untold stories from America's bloodiest war, despite the fact that Galveston was a focal point of hostilities throughout the conflict. Galveston emerged as one of the Confederacy's only lifelines to the outside world.                  Naval Strategies of the Civil War: Confederate Innovations and Federal Opportunism          Compare and contrast the strategies of the Southern Secretary of the Navy, Mallory, against his rival in the North, Welles. Mallory used technological innovation and the skill of individuals to bolster the South's seapower against the Union Navy's superior numbers                  The Last Battle of the Civil War: Palmetto Ranch           May 12-13, the last battle of the Civil War had been fought at the southernmost tip of Texasesulting in a Confederate victory. Although Palmetto Ranch did nothing to change the war's outcome, it added the final irony to a conflict replete with ironies                  The Final Fury: Palmito Ranch, the Last Battle of the Civil War           There was no formal, final surrender; Lee's color-striking at Appomattox Court House only ended the war for one Confederate fighting force. While the government moved out of Richmond, other Rebel forces remained, dormant but unbowed.

Blunt    Confederate :Major General Sterling Price Outcome:  Union Victory. 650 casualties of which 400 were Union soldiers. Overview of the Battle :  Price’s force was in full retreat following its expedition into Missouri. On October 28, 1864, it stopped to rest about two miles south of Newtonia, Missouri. Soon afterward, Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt’s Union troops surprised the Confederates and began to drive them. Brig. Gen. Joe Shelby’s division, including his Iron Brigade, rode to the front, dismounted, and engaged the Yankees while the other Rebel troops retreated towards Indian Territory. Brig. Gen. John B. Sanborn later appeared with Union reinforcements which convinced Shelby to retire. The Union troops forced the Confederates to retreat but failed to destroy or capture them.

Total casualties unknown  200 Indians. Overview of the Battle :  Scattered Indian raids had caused much ill-will between the white settlers and the Native Americans. In the autumn, Territorial (Colorado) officers had offered a vague amnesty if Indians reported to army forts. Black Kettle with many Cheyennes and a few Arapahos, believing themselves to be protected, established a winter camp about 40 miles from Fort Lyon. On November 29, Col. John Chivington, who advocated Indian extermination, arrived near the camp, having marched there from Fort Lyon. In spite of the American flag and a white flag flying over the camp, the troops attacked, killing and mutilating about 200 of the Indians, two-thirds of whom were women and children..

Stone and Colonel Edward Baker    Confederate :Brigadier General Nathan G. Evans Outcome:  Confederate Victory. 1,070 casualties of which 921 were Union soldiers. Overview of the Battle :  Confederate Brig. Gen. Nathan “Shanks” Evans stopped a badly coordinated attempt by Union forces under Brig. Gen. Charles P. Stone to cross the Potomac at Harrison’s Island and capture Leesburg. A timely Confederate counterattack drove the Federals over the bluff and into the river. More than 700 Federals were captured. Col. Edward D. Baker (a U.S. Senator) was killed. This Union rout had severe political ramifications in Washington and led to the establishment of the Congressional Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War.

He was one of the first historians to fully understand the impact that California had on the war as he gives an accounting of the Federal raid on the Dan Showalter Ranch in San Bernadino on October 5, 1861.                  The Battle of the Wilderness May 5-6, 1864           Fought in a tangled forest fringing the south bank of the Rapidan River, the Battle of the Wilderness marked the initial engagement in the climactic months of the Civil War in Virginia, and the first encounter between Ulysses S.

The Camden Expedition of 1864 and the Opportunity Lost by the Confederacy to Change the Civil War      The Confederacy had a great opportunity to turn the Civil War in its favor in 1864, but squandered this chance when it failed to finish off a Union army cornered in Louisiana because of concerns about another Union army coming south from Arkansas. The Confederates were so confused that they could not agree on a course of action to contend with both threats, thus the Union offensive advancing from Arkansas saved the one in Louisiana and became known to history as the Camden Expedition.                  A Stranger And a Sojourner: Peter Caulder, Free Black Frontiersman in Antebellum Arkansas      An illiterate free black man, defied all generalizations about race as he served with distinction as a marksman in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812, repeatedly crossed the color line, and became an Arkansas yeoman farmer, thriving and respected by white neighbors until he fell victim of new discriminatory legislation on the eve of the Civil War                           The Indians and the Civil War - Effects of the American Civil War on the Native American History          Native American  history has always been a study full of ambiguous points. Nowadays, when the outlived tribes still live on poor circumstances and try to keep step with our running world despairingly, their unique culture deserves more attention than used to.                  Civil War in the Indian Territory         When the war broke out, both sides wanted  the Five Civilized Tribes, led by the Cherokees, and each got around half. The Confederacy sent Brigadier General Albert Pike to recruit them, and he did a pretty good job. A strange, brilliant, man, Pike's career as a General is a minor footnote in his long life                  The Cherokee Nation in the Civil War          The Cherokee people, who had only just begun to recover from the ordeal of removal, faced an equally devastating upheaval in the Civil War. The Cherokee Nation, with its sovereign status and distinct culture, had a wartime experience unlike that of any other group of people                 Black Flag: Guerrilla Warfare on the Western Border, 1861-1865: A Riveting Account of a Bloody Chapter in Civil War History         The guerilla warfare along the Kansas-Missouri boarder brought forth some of the bloodiest incidents of the Civil War                         The Constitution of the Confederate States of America      The original document consisted of five vellum sheest pasted together to form a scroll over twelve feet long. The original document was found at a train station in 1865 by Felix DeFontaine. In 1883, he sold the manuscript to Mrs. George Wymberley Jones DeRenne. In 1939, the DeRenne family sold the document to the University of Georgia                  Shiloh and Corinth: Sentinels of Stone            The brave deeds performed by soldiers of the North and South.

Substitutes abound, as do ways to preserve food, care for crops and animals, make straw hats and squirrel-skin shoes, and cure everything from cancer to small pox to ingrown toenails                  To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War           Thousands of former slaves flocked to southern cities in search of work, they found the demands placed on them as wage-earners disturbingly similar to those they had faced as slaves: seven-day workweeks, endless labor, and poor treatment                  Mothers of Invention: Women of the Slaveholding South in the American Civil War           When Confederate men marched off to battle, southern women struggled with the new responsibilities of directing farms and plantations, providing for families, and supervising increasingly restive slaves                  She Went to the Field:          Women Soldiers of the Civil War           several substantiated cases of female soldiers during the American Civil War, including Sarah Rosetta Wakeman (aka Private Wakeman, Union); Sarah Emma Edmonds (aka Private Thompson, Union); Loreta Janeta Velazquez (aka Lieutenant Buford, Confederate); and Jennie Hodgers (aka Private Cashier, Union).                            Ironclads and Big Guns of the Confederacy : The Journal and Letters of John M. Brooke          Information about the Confederate Navy's effort to supply its fledgling forces, the wartime diaries and letters of John M. Brooke tell the neglected story of the Confederate naval ordnance office, its innovations, and its strategic vision.                  Six Years of Hell: Harpers Ferry During the Civil War           While Harpers Ferry was an important location during the Civil War, in most Civil War books it's a sideshow of something larger. John Brown's raid, Lee's invasions of 1862 & 1863 as well as Early's 1864 raid are all covered in depth                 Struggle for the Heartland: The Campaigns from Fort Henry to Corinth            The military campaign that began in early 1862 with the advance to Fort Henry and culminated in late May with the capture of Corinth, Mississippi.

Not doing so provided a retreat for A. S. Johnston to move his men to Corinth and then to Shiloh                   Lee's Cavalrymen: A History of the Mounted Forces of the Army of Northern Virginia, 1861-1865      The cavalry of the Army of Northern Virginia its leadership, the military life of its officers and men as revealed in their diaries and letters, the development of its tactics as the war evolved, and the influence of government policies on its operational abilities. All the major players and battles are involved                 War in Kentucky: From Shiloh to Perryville           Union gains in the Mississippi Valley and in Tennessee and Kentucky had brought the Confederacy to a point of crisis. This addition to the literature on the Civil War in the West tells how the Union then failed to press home its advantage while the Confederacy failed to force Kentucky into the Confederacy                            The Battle of the Wilderness May 5-6, 1864           Fought in a tangled forest fringing the south bank of the Rapidan River, the Battle of the Wilderness marked the initial engagement in the climactic months of the Civil War in Virginia, and the first encounter between Ulysses S.

Grant's Secret Service: The Intelligence War from Belmont to Appomattox          The first scholarly examination of the use of military intelligence under Ulysses S. Grant's command during the Civil War. Feis makes the new and provocative argument that Grant's use of the Army of the Potomac's Bureau of Military Information played a significant role in Lee's defeat                  Men of Fire: Grant, Forrest, and the Campaign That Decided the Civil War            In the winter of 1862, on the border between Kentucky and Tennessee, two extraordinary military leaders faced each other in an epic clash that would transform them both and change the course of American history forever                            The Longest Raid of the Civil War: Little-Known & Untold Stories of Morgan's Raid into Kentucky, Indiana & Ohio          Kentucky, a slave state, did not secede. Many were pro Confederate however. Jefferson Davis was from Kentucky, Lincoln was also born there.                  Charles W. Quantrell         A True History Of His Guerilla Warfare On The Missouri And Kansas Border During The Civil War Of 1861-1865           This book was written just as Captain Harrison Trow told it to John P. Burch, giving accounts of fights that he participated in, narrow escapes experienced, dilemmas it seemed almost impossible to get out of, and also other battles                  Secret Six: The True Tale of the Men Who Conspired with John Brown           The story of how Brown was covertly aided by a circle of prosperous and privileged Northeasterners who supplied him with money and weapons, and, before the raid, even hid him in their homes while authorities sought Brown on a murder charge. These men called themselves the Secret Six.

Davis           Everything You Need to Know About America's Greatest Conflict but Never Learned         This fresh look at America's greatest conflict will dispel all those misconceptions you acquired by watching ""Gone With the Wind"". Davis has a genius for bringing history to life, sorting out the players, the politics and the key events -- Harpers Ferry, Shiloh, Gettysburg, Emancipation, Reconstruction -- in a way that will enlighten even the most dedicated back-of-the-class napper. A brilliant crash course, this book vividly brings to life the people -- from Dred Scott to Abraham Lincoln -- and the everyday details that make up History with a capital H.                                          The Civil War : A Narrative           by  Shelby Foote         Fort Sumter to Perryville         Fredericksburg to Meridian         Red River to Appomattox         This beautifully written trilogy of books on the American Civil War is not only a piece of first-rate history, but also a marvelous work of literature. Shelby Foote brings a skilled novelist's narrative power to this great epic. Many know Foote for his prominent role as a commentator on Ken Burns's PBS series about the Civil War. These three books, however, are his legacy. His southern sympathies are apparent: the first volume opens by introducing Confederate President Jefferson Davis, rather than Abraham Lincoln. But they hardly get in the way of the great story Foote tells. This hefty three volume set should be on the bookshelf of any Civil War buff.                           The Railroads of the Confederacy         by:  Robert C. Black, Robert C. III Black           The Railroads of the Confederacy tells the story of the first use of railroads on a major scale in a major war. Robert Black presents a complex tale, with the railroads of the American South playing the part of tragic hero in the Civil War: at first vigorous though immature; then overloaded, driven unmercifully, starved for iron; and eventually worn out - struggling on to inevitable destruction in the wake of Sherman's army, carrying the Confederacy down with them. With maps of all the Confederate railroads and contemporary photographs and facsimiles of such documents as railroad tickets, timetables, and soldiers' passes, the book will captivate railroad enthusiasts as well as readers interested in the Civil War.                              The American Heritage New History of the Civil War  : by  Bruce Catton, James M. McPherson         Hardcover - 640 pages Book & Cd edition (October 1996)                              Photographic History of the Civil War         by  William C. Davis,         Vicksburg to Appomattox          Fighting for Time          The South Besieged         The End of an Era         This picture and reference book provides many of the often searched for pictures that have previously been lost in the Library of Congress                                 Grant Rises in the West          by  Kenneth P. Williams         From Iuka to Vicksburg, 1862-1863         Paperback - 654 pages         University of Nebraska June 1997                             'The Damned Red Flags of the Rebellion'          by Richard Rollins          The Confederate Battle Flag at Gettysburg         This is the first and foremost book on the subject of the Confederate battle flags. Not only does it provide a very detailed look at the flags lost at Gettysburg but, it also gives a true relationship of the men and their flags and what it meant to them. It is a book all people, who look at the Condeferate Flag either as a symbol of hate or one of a heritage long past, should read. It places the flag and the people surrounding it in their proper light. It tells the concise story of how the flag came to be, it military as well as social place in the American Civil War and in this country's heritage.                              After Appomattox           by  Stetson Kennedy         How the South Won the War         ""A fascinating study of the failure of Reconstruction. . . . This lively and compelling account of the tragedy of Reconstruction is a useful volume which clearly makes its point and deserves to be read by novices as well as those familiar with the subject. Kennedy uses a variety of sources and successfully argues that although the South lost on the battlefield, they won the war during Reconstruction.""                              Escape from Slavery         by:  Frederick Douglass, Michael McCurdy           The Boyhood of Frederick Douglass in His Own Words         With the power of his words and the truth of his own experience, Frederick Douglass dramatized the abomination of slavery and the struggle of a young man to break free. In this shortened version of Douglass' 1845 autobiography, McCurdy has done a splendid job of bringing the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass to middle-grade readers.                              Frederick Douglass         by:  David B. Chesebrough         Oratory from Slavery          Great American Orators, No. 26         Frederick Douglass, once a slave, was one of the great 19th century American orators and the most important African American voice of his era. This book traces the development of his rhetorical skills, discusses the effect of his oratory on his contemporaries, and analyzes the specific oratorical techniques he employed.                                Battle on the Bay:          The Civil War Struggle for Galveston              First detailed study of a Texas city during the Civil War. At the end of the war, Galveston was the last major port in Confederate hands. Its story is dramatic and one of the great untold stories of the war. A must for anyone interested in the Trans-Mississippi department as well as the serious collector.           Civil War history of Galveston is one of the last untold stories from America's bloodiest war, despite the fact that Galveston was a focal point of hostilities throughout the conflict. Galveston emerged as one of the Confederacy's only lifelines to the outside world.                                Antietam The Soldiers Battle            Synopsis  : A historian tells of this bloody Civil War battle from an entirely new point of view: that of the common enlisted man. Seventy-two detailed maps describe the battle in both hourly and quarter-hourly formats. 37 rare photos.         As the book runs from anectdote to anectdote, the reader is able to get a clearer picture of the battle and what happened there. As a Civil War Reenactor, my unit fought at Antietam, and the anectdotes helped me to be more realistic in my impression.                              Days of Defiance         by  Maury Klein         Sumter, Secession, and the Coming of the Civil War          Military History Editor's Recommended Book         Maury Klein's knack for words shows up on the first page of this book: ""How could the oldest, deadliest, most divisive conflict of a proud nation come down, after decades of bitter strife, to a dispute over an insignificant fort squatting on a hunk of rock in the harbor of the South's oldest and most defiant city?"" Klein, a history professor at the University of Rhode Island, goes on to answer this question in lively prose. The Fort Sumter saga, of course, has been told well by others, but Klein makes the tale worth reading again.                             The Alabama and the Kearsarge           by  William Marvel          The Sailor's Civil War         Civil War America                                          American Realities           by  J. William T. Youngs, Cecly Moon         Historical Episodes :         From the First Settlements to the Civil War          Paperback - 322 pages         Addison-Wesley 1996         4th edition                     Harriet Beecher Stowe           by  Suzanne M. Coil         Impact Books          Impact Biographies          Grade 7-12. Coil's admiring biography of Harriet Beecher Stowe creates a portrait of the celebrated author as a dutiful daughter; a committed abolitionist; a loving wife devoted to an often brilliant but ineffectual husband. The biography will be a useful addition to any collection, but it will be particularly helpful to students needing information about the years leading up to the Civil War, the work of the abolitionists, and the novel that ""moved the world.""                     Uncle Tom's Cabin         by  Harriet Beecher Stowe           An international bestseller that sold more than 300,000 copies when it first appeared in 1852, Uncle Tom's Cabin was dismissed by some as abolitionist propaganda; yet Tolstoy deemed it a great work of literature ""flowing from love of God and man."" Today, however, Harriet Beecher Stowe's stirring indictment of slavery is often confused with garish dramatizations that flourished for decades after the Civil War: productions that relied heavily on melodramatic simplifications of character totally alien to the original. Thus ""Uncle Tom"" has become a pejorative term for a subservient black, whereas Uncle Tom in the book is a man who, under the most inhumane of circumstances, never loses his human dignity. ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is the most powerful and most enduring work of art ever written about American slavery,"" said Alfred Kazin.                                The Mutiny at Brandy Station: The Last Battle of the Hooker Brigade              THE MUTINY AT BRANDY STATION  presents, in microcosm, the character and actions of men who served the United States Army of the Potomac in 1864. The story follows key players through the reorganization, the courts martial, and into the Wilderness using direct quotes from their diaries, memoirs, and reports as well as original transcripts of the trials. 78 b&w illustrations.

Battle at Bull Run          by  William C. Davis         A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War          This new and revised edition of the original 1977 book offers the reader a splendid narrative of the first major battle of the American Civil War. On the 21st of July 1861, 60,000 American soldiers from the North and South met along the banks of Bull Run. In the fighting that followed the Union forces lost 2,900 out of the 20,000 men engaged while the Confederates lost 2,000 out of about 17,000 engaged.         This book is an enjoyable and easy to read story and is well presented by a number of photographs taken at the time of the battle or shortly after. The author has included 8 small, but easy to read maps that help you follow the outline of events during the battle. This book is recommended to any body who has a love for this period of history or to the general reader who likes a good story.                     The Abolitionists and the South, 1831-1861  : by  Stanley Harrold            Stanley Harrold well-written work is an important contribution to antislavery historiography. Taking to task those historians who see antislavery as primarily a movement to reform Northern society, Harrold demonstrates that Northern and Southern abolitionists were active in the South up until the Civil War. Furthermore, Harrold makes a convincing case that the very real abolitionist presence in the Upper South was a ""precipitative cause of secession and the Civil War."" For Harrold, the Southern response to the abolitionist threat was neither irrational or exaggerated. I commend Harrold work to any student of antislavery or the antebellum South.                                Allen Jay and the Underground Railroad           Allen Jay and the Underground Railroad is the retelling of a man's recollections of his first experience helping an escaped slave. The book brings the underground railroad down to the level primary students can comprehend. This book makes for wonderful discussions regarding overcoming one's fears, going against the norm and doing what you believe to be morally correct.                              Above a Common Soldier   : by  Charles Francis Clarke         Darlis A. Miller         Frank and Mary Clarke in the American West and Civil War          First published as TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION in 1941, this rare volume of Civil War-era letters relates the poignant experiences of an English immigrant in the service of the United States Army. After Frank Clarke's tragic death in 1862, his wife Mary corresponded with his English mother, detailing the daily struggles of a military widow and her five sons in frontier Kansas. 12 halftones .

He is portrayed as an  archetypical   American  hero. In the chain of command of the Special Forces, he is  Sonya Blade 's direct superior and clearly the counterbalancing force of Sonya's impulsiveness. Jax is clear-headed, careful, and always keeping a watch on what his men are doing. He unscrupulously makes use of the most advanced technology to improve both himself and his unit.     [ edit ]   Storyline             The plot summary in this article  is too long or detailed compared to the rest of the content . Please  edit the article  to  focus on discussing the work  rather than merely  reiterating the plot .  (September 2008)         [ edit ]   Pre- Mortal Kombat   Jax made his first appearance in  Mortal Kombat II , though, in terms of the fictional chronology, his first adventure is depicted in  Mortal Kombat: Special Forces . This game opened depicting a prison break at Special Forces' detention facility. Jax, driving along a highway, received a transmission from his fellow Special Forces operative  Gemini  detailing the escape and the escapees:  No Face ,  Tasia ,  Jarek  and  Tremor . She informed him that they had escaped to a warehouse on the town's south side, likely receiving assistance from an outside source. Jax surmised that source to be  Kano . He received another transmission from one Lieutenant Sanchez, whose squad had arrived at the warehouse. After the transmission was cut off at the source, Jax arrived at the scene to find the squad destroyed. For this, he swore he would achieve vengeance against Kano. Using prototype bionic implants on his arms in order to enhance his strength, Jax set out to find his enemy.   Infiltrating the warehouse, Jax confronted No-Face and dispatched him. Proceeding into the sewers, he did likewise to Tasia. At this point, Gemini contacted Jax again and informed him that the Black Dragon were using a corporate building as a front for their base of operations. At the building, Jax confronted and defeated Jarek. His investigation then led him to the town of the lost city of Sin Kiang. There, he defeated Tremor and discovered a portal to Outworld. Surmising that the portal was linked to Kano's plans of global domination, he entered. Jax caught up with Kano, who had acquired an artifact called the Eye of Shitian. Through this artifact, Kano could acquire great power. After an exchange of words, the two fought and Jax emerged the victor. He used the Eye's power to bring them both back to Earthrealm and brought Kano into custody, only to have the criminal escape at a later date. At this point, Jax ceased using his bionic implants.     [ edit ]   Mortal Kombat II   Jax's first appearance on a fighting game was in  Mortal Kombat II . Jax first came across the Earthrealm warriors when he found  Johnny Cage  in the waters close to the Special Forces Agency. Jax began interrogating him. Cage explains his story and although is not trusted at first, is eventually set free. Jax doesn't believe Johnny's story until he receives a video signal from Sonya, who is temporarily working with Kano to escape the Outworld. As an apology for Jax not believing Cage, he visits him at a commercial shoot where Johnny is being attacked. Jax participates in a short battle with  Kintaro  here. The battle is interrupted when the Earthrealm warriors arrive to help. After they save Johnny from the intruders, they travel into Outworld to compete in the tournament and save Sonya.     [ edit ]   Mortal Kombat 3   Soon Jax came to learn of the Emperor's dark plans for Earthrealm. As soon as he had freed Sonya (and inadvertently Kano), he headed back home to warn his government of the impending danger. He would find himself frustrated, however, as not only did Kano escape back into Outworld, but the government did not believe the major.   Jax began to prepare for war covertly and once more outfitted his arms with bionic implants. After helping foil Shao Kahn's attempt to permanently claim Earth as his own, Jax became the commanding officer of the Outer World Investigation Agency (OIA). They operated from an underground bunker and had scouts in various realms. Not only did they explore and map these realms, but they also looked for and destroyed inter-realm portals that could lead to Earth.     [ edit ]   Mortal Kombat 4   After he discovered that  Jarek  was hiding in Edenia, he started looking for him. When the Fallen Elder God  Shinnok  invaded Edenia, Jax went into action. He made a brief alliance with Raiden and his forces to defeat Shinnok, which Jarek was apart of. After Shinnok's defeat, Jarek tried to kill Jax's ally, Sonya, but Jax killed Jarek before he could do anything. After these events, he and Sonya found the Lin Kuei cyborg  Cyrax , malfunctioning and trapped in a desert. Returning with him to their home base, they reversed the automation process, restored his humanity, and gained a new ally.     [ edit ]   Deadly Alliance   Years later, trouble would occur again. Not only were his agents  Kenshi  and Cyrax lost in Outworld, but the OIA underground facility was nuked into oblivion by the traitor  Hsu Hao . Soon after, when Raiden summoned the Earthrealm warriors to the abandoned island of Shang Tsung and asked them to travel with him to Outworld to bring down the Deadly Alliance, Jax didn't hesitate. He used this trip as a cover to track down Hsu Hao and kill him by tearing out his artificial heart.   During the final attack on the Deadly Alliance, Jax along with the other Earthrealm warriors are killed by the Deadly Alliance's Tarkatan warriors. After  Onaga  defeats Raiden and the Alliance, he resurrects the Earthrealm heroes as his slaves. Their mind control is later broken by  Ermac  and the spirit of  Liu Kang .     [ edit ]   Armageddon   During the events of  Mortal Kombat: Armageddon , Jax is sent by Sonya to investigate the remains of a Tekunin Warship. When he does not return, she assumes Jax has been captured, noting strange readings from his bio-scanners.   In his ending for  Mortal Kombat: Armageddon , Jax becomes a full cyborg after defeating Blaze, and leaves the Special Forces. He then takes control of the Tekunin by defeating  Sektor , an act of revenge after discovering a neural control chip implanted in his brain by Sektor himself. The ending also states that, after this, it is unknown if Jax would ever return to the Special Forces. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Appearances in other media           Lynn ""Red"" Williams  as Jax in  Mortal Kombat: Annihilation         [ edit ]   Film   Jax (misspelled in the closing credits as  Jaxx ) makes a brief appearance in the first  Mortal Kombat  film, in which he advises Sonya not to board  Shang Tsung 's ship after accompanying her on the raid on Kano's club near the beginning of the movie. He was played by Gregory McKinney.   In  Mortal Kombat: Annihilation , Jax was played by former  American Gladiators  actor  Lynn ""Red"" Williams . He fought alongside Sonya and her friends against Shao Kahn, and though his  ambiguous  relationship with his cybernetic enhancements he uses was explored a bit, Jax was overall a comic relief and tough-talking African American  stock character .     [ edit ]   Television   Jax appeared in the animated series  Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm  as one of the leading characters, and was voiced by  Dorian Harewood . He was portrayed as a cool-minded character and almost always in an amiable mood, despite occasional clashes with Raiden.     [ edit ]   Comic books   Jax makes his first appearance in the  Malibu Comics  series in  Goro: Prince of Pain  1st issue. He's unchanged from his game's story, being the Major of the Special Forces and Sonya's friend. He has a tendency to make jokes and puns during fights, but remains mostly faithful to his game characterization. During Goro's miniseries, Jax sets out to find Sonya, who disappeared while chasing Kano to Shang Tsung's island. Shang Tsung uses him to find the missing Goro, falsely telling him that Sonya was held hostage by Goro in Outworld. In the series' epilogue, he reunites with Sonya and captures Kano.   During the second miniseries,  Battlewave , Jax is attacked by Goro and left in a coma. He later foils Jade and Smoke's attempt on his life, and joins Johnny Cage in Outworld after Sonya went missing while investigating Shang Tsung's island. In the epilogue, Jax's arms are injured by Baraka, which set up the plot for his receiving his cybernetic implants, but a third miniseries was never created after Malibu ended the series completely in 1995.   Jax, alongside Sonya and a team of exclusively-created Special Forces agents, featured in a two-issue miniseries entitled  U.S. Special Forces , in which the team engages Black Dragon member Rojack in his attempt to get treasures from a dimensional gate to another dimension.     [ edit ]   Character development   Before Sonya existed, Jax was originally conceived as a character and possessed her scenario for the first  Mortal Kombat . However, since there were no female characters in the original roster at the time, Sonya was created and she inherited his story line of pursuing Kano and entrapment on Shang Tsung's island.   His original name was going to be  Kurtis Stryker . Midway later recycled that name to create a new character in  Mortal Kombat 3 . Jax was also originally conceived as simply a  kickboxer , but the idea was scrapped due to potential similarities to  Balrog  and  Sagat  from the  Street Fighter  series. Then he was given a yellow  martial arts   gi  and big metal hands that clanged upon impact. However, the outfit concealed much of the impressive physique of actor/bodybuilder John Parrish, so he simply went shirtless with long black tights. Game footage was actually shot with Jax wearing the yellow costume, and Parrish accidentally split the pants during filming. He had the bionic implants painted onto his arms for  MK3.   In the very early screenshots of  Deadly Alliance , Jax was seen in his classic  MK3  attire, however, it is later decided to give Jax a new look. [1]  His alternate costume in  Deadly Alliance  and  Armageddon  confirmed that his implants were removable. However, the game programmers mistakenly outfitted Jax with a red beret instead of a green one; a red beret represents  Army Airborne  units like the 82nd Airborne or  101st Screaming Eagles , whereas green is worn by the members of Army  Special Forces .

[ 1 ]       Garet Jax  is a  fictional character  from  Terry Brooks '  epic fantasy [ 2 ]  novel  The Wishsong of Shannara . He is known as the ""Weapons Master"", [ 1 ]  and it is said that no matter what weapon you choose, even your hands and feet, Garet Jax is better with it. He claims to have never lost a fight, and all who have seen him fight stand by that statement. He is seeking the one opponent who can finally defeat him in a battle.           Contents       1   Biography     1.1   The Wishsong of Shannara   1.2   Dark Wraith of Shannara       2   Is he Stee Jans?   3   References   4   External links               [ edit ]   Biography     [ edit ]   The Wishsong of Shannara   Garet first appears when he rescues  Jair Ohmsford  from a band of nine  Gnome  Hunters, defeating eight of them single-handedly--he killed six, knocked out their leader, and one fled. The ninth,  Slanter , doesn't even attempt to fight, saying that he was only working with them because he had to, and he has heard stories about the fighting prowess of Garet. When Jair asked Garet why he rescued him, Garet says that Jair interests him, something that ""few things do anymore"". [ 3 ]  The three travel together to the  Eastland , to  Culhaven .   Along the way Garet receives a vision of himself fighting a creature of flame, and he knew that this was the one creature who could give him a 'run for his money' in battle. This is the main reason that convinces him on to join Jair in his quest to journey to Heaven's Well [ 1 ]  to save his sister  Brin  and to save the Silver River. Though he did agree to accompany Jair to Cullhaven before he received the aforementioned vision, this may have been from an influence from the  King of the Silver River . [ 4 ]       Garet Jax led the charge, darting through the Gnomes that rushed to bar his passage, swift, and fluid as he killed them. He was like a black-clad dancer, all grace, power, and seemingly effortless motion. Gnome hunters, gnarled and worn from countless battles, threw themselves in front of him with frenzied determination, their weapons hacking and cutting with lethal force. They might as well have been trying to contain quicksilver. None could touch the Weapons Master, and those who came close enough to try found in him the black shadow of death come to claim their lives. [ 5 ]       At the Croagh leading to  Heaven's Well , where Brin will be found, Garet, Jair and Slanter are stopped by a  Jachyra , a lethal creature from the Old World. Garet realizes that this fiery-red monster is the battle promised him in his vision, and orders Jair and Slanter to go ahead and save Brin while he fights the Jachyra.   When Jair and Slanter return, having saved Brin, they find Garet Jax sitting against a wall, his sword still held in his hand and looking like he might even be sleeping, but on closer inspection they realize the Weapons Master is dead. [ 1 ]  Of the Jachyra there is no sign [ 1 ]  --the magic that brought it to the  Four Lands  has been destroyed--but Jair is convinced the Weapons Master slew his foe before succumbing to his wounds. When asked who it was that won, Terry Brooks responded with ""What do you think?"" [ 6 ]  Because of the collapse of the Croagh, Garet Jax's body was never recovered. However, Jair thought that this seemed appropriate, that Garet Jax should be where no other mortal could go, that he should be no different in death than in life.     [ edit ]   Dark Wraith of Shannara   Garet Jax himself does not make a true appearance in  Dark Wraith of Shannara , but is still a main character.  Jair Ohmsford  uses the Wishsong in the book in order to meld him and his memories of Garet Jax into one sentient being. Jair still thinks like himself, but moves and fights as though he were the weapons master.   First, Jair used the Wishsong to become Garet Jax when he is confronted by  Mwellrets  while attempting to steal the last page of the  Ildatch . He uses the Wishsong to appear as though he is Garet Jax. But when his life is actually threatened, he succumbs to the power lust and truly combines his spirit with Garet Jax's.   The next time we see Jair use the Wishsong to become Garet Jax is when he is confronted by a  Koden  while traversing the  Charnal region . He doesn't want to use the Wishsong, because of the promise he made to his sister Brin. But once again succumbs and becomes Garet Jax once more.   The third and final time Jair uses the wishsong to become Garet Jax is near the end of his journey when he is locked in combat with numerous  Mwellrets  and the dreaded  Croton Witch . Jair initially prevails, and talks about how easy it would have been for him to fully give in, and just become Garet Jax forever.   The appearance of Garet Jax in  Dark Wraith of Shannara  is much different than it is described in  The Wishsong of Shannara --in that novel, he has almost white hair and flint gray eyes, but in  Dark Wraith , he appears to have brown hair, and darker (possibly green) eyes. [ citation needed ]   Terry Brooks expressed his desire in the beginning of  Dark Wraith  to further explore the relationship between Jair and Garet Jax. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Is he Stee Jans?             This article  does not  cite  any  references or sources . Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (July 2008)       Many rumors [ who? ]  have been discussed about the possibility of Garet Jax actually being  Stee Jans , the ""Iron Man"" from  The Elfstones of Shannara . This can most likely be attributed to the talk of it in the book  World of Shannara . [ citation needed ]  However, this is dubious, as Stee Jans has ""rust-colored hair"" [ 8 ]  and a beard, and Garet Jax was described as having hair almost silver in color with no beard. [ citation needed ]  While there is a possibility of his hair turning white with age, there is no mention of how old Garet Jax is and Jair's initial impression of him mentioned nothing about him looking old enough to have a full head of gray hair. The one feature that almost conclusively proves [ citation needed ]  that they are not the same person, is that the books mention that Garet Jax has ""flint gray eyes"" [ 9 ]  while Stee Jans's are described as ""hazel"". [ 8 ]   Some people believe [ who? ]  that Garet Jax may be the son of Stee Jans, a rumor that holds more credibility [ citation needed ]  but ultimately is unprovable either way.

clueweb09-en0005-02-07131	"                    Xi'an, Part 2: The Ancient City Wall                                    Overview         The first landmark visitors will encounter in Xi'an is the ancient city   wall, which stretches round the old city. The northern side runs parallel to the railway. Xi'an was originally a   walled city, and even today the wall is considered a landmark dividing the city   into the inner part and the outer part. The city wall is massive -  tall, long and thick. The South Gate and   North Gate are the two main entrances to the inner city. The city itself is   neatly arranged along the city wall.               History                               Xi'an City Wall was  erected in the 14th century  Ming Dynasty, under the regime of Emperor   Zhu Yuanzhang. When Zhu Yuanzhang captured   Huizhou, long before the establishment of the Ming Dynasty, he was admonished by   a hermit named Zhu Sheng, who told him to ""build high walls, store abundant   provisions and take your time in proclaiming yourself emperor."" This advice Zhu Yuanzhang heeded. Once the whole country was unified, he sent orders to the   local governments to build city walls on a large scale. Zhu assured that ""out of   all the mountains and rivers in the world, the area of Central Qin is the most strongly   fortified and strategically impregnable."" The current city wall  is an enhancement of the old Tang Dynasty structure, as   a result of the emperor's wall building campaign.                The Structure of the City Wall       The first city wall of Xi'an was built of earth, rammed layer upon layer. The   base layer was made of earth, quick lime, and glutinous rice extract, tamped   together. It made the wall extremely strong and firm. Later, the wall was   totally enclosed with bricks. A moat,   wide and deep, ran around the city. Over the moat, there used to be a huge   drawbridge, which would cut off the way in and out of the city, once   lifted.       Xi'an's city wall, after its enlargement   in the Ming Dynasty, stands 12 meters high. It is 12-14 meters across the top,   15-18 meters thick at bottom, and 13.7 kilometers in length. There is a rampart   every 120 meters. The ramparts are towers that extend out from the main wall. The   ramparts were built to allow soldiers to see enemies  trying to climb the   wall. The distance between the ramparts is  within the range of arrows fired   from either side. This allowed soldiers to protect the entire wall without   exposing themselves to the enemy.There are altogether 98 ramparts; each has a sentry building on   top of it.                 The Gates       The gates of the city   wall were the only way to go into and out of town. Therefore, these gates were   important, strategic points, that the feudal rulers racked their brains to try   to defend. In Xi'an's case, the north, south, east and west gates, each consist   of three gate towers: the gate   tower, which holds the drawbridge,  the narrow tower and the main tower. The gate tower proud of the wall. It is used to lift and lower the drawbridge. The narrow tower is in the middle. Its inner walls have square windows to shoot arrows from. The main tower is the   innermost one. It is the main entrance to the city.                Tunnels       The narrow tower and the main tower are   connected by tunnels, called Wengcheng, in which soldiers could be stationed.   From the Wengcheng there are also horse passages leading to the top of the wall.   There are gradually ascending steps, made so that it was easy for war horses to   ascend and descend. There are all together 11 horse passages around the city.                Watch Towers       A   watch tower is located on each of the four corners of the wall. The one at the   southwestern corner is round, probably after the model of the imperial city wall   of the Tang Dynasty, but the other three are square-shaped. On top of the watch   towers there is a corner rampart, higher and larger than the ordinary ramparts.   This shows the strategic importance of the corners of the city wall in war   times.                          Battlements       Along the outer crest of the city wall there are   crenellations or battlements. Under each of the 5,984 crenels there is a square   hole, from which arrows were shot and watch was kept. The lower, inner walls are   called parapets. They were used  to prevent soldiers   from falling off the wall, when traveling back and forth on top of the wall.                                                                           "
clueweb09-en0005-92-16815	"                                                                           Great Wall of China                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The Great Wall of China (literally ""long city wall"") or is a series of stone and earthen fortifications in China, built between 5th century BC and the 17th century to protect the northern borders of the Chinese Empire during the rule of successive dynasties.                      Several walls, referred to as the Great Wall of China, were built since the 5th century BC, the most famous being the one built between 220 BC and 200 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang; this wall was located much further north than the current wall built during the Ming Dynasty, and little of it remains.                     The Great Wall is the world's longest man-made structure, stretching over 6,352 km (3,948 miles) from Shanhai Pass in the east to Lop Nur in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia.                                           History                     The Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building by time of the Spring and Autumn Period, which began around 8th century BC. During the Warring States Period from 5th century BC to 221 BC, the states of Qi, Yan and Zhao all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders. Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were mostly made by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.                     Qin Shi Huang conquered all opposing states and unified China in 221 BC, establishing the Qin Dynasty. Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the wall sections that divided his empire along the former state borders. To protect the empire against intrusions by the Xiongnu people from the north, he ordered the building of a new wall that connects the remaining fortifications along the empire's new northern frontier. Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin Dynasty walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today.                     The Great Wall concept was revived during the Ming Dynasty, following the Ming army's defeat by the Mongols in the Battle of Tumu in 1449. The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper-hand over the Mongols after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire. The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the Mongols out, by constructing walls along the northern border of China. Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the Ordos Desert, the wall followed the desert's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the Huang He.                     Unlike the earlier Qin fortifications, the Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of bricks and stone instead of rammed earth. As Mongol raids continued periodically over the years, the Ming devoted considerable resources to repair and reinforce the walls. The sections near the Ming capital of Beijing were especially strengthened.                     Towards the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the Manchu invasions that began around 1600. Under the military command of Yuan Chonghuan, the Ming army held off the Manchus at the heavily fortified Shanhai Pass, thus preventing the Manchus from entering the Liaodong Peninsula and the Chinese heartland. The Manchus were finally able to cross the Great Wall in 1644, when the gates of Shanhai Pass were opened by Wu Sangui, a rebel Ming border general. The Manchus quickly seized the Ming capital of Beijing, and subsequently defeated the remaining Ming resistance to establish the Qing Dynasty.                     Construction and repairs of the Great Wall were discontinued under the Qing rule, as China's borders extended beyond the walls and Mongolia was annexed into the empire.                                           Notable areas                     The following three sections are located in Beijing Province where reconstruction has taken place and which are regularily visited by modern tourists:                     "" The North Pass of Juyongguan pass, known as the Badaling. When used by the Chinese to protect their land, this wall was well-manned by guards so as to guard Chinas capital, Beijing. Made out of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8 meters high and 5 meters wide.                     "" One of the most striking sights of the Ming Great Wall, is where the wall climbs extremely steep slopes. It runs 11 kilometers long, ranges from 5 to 8 meters in height, and 6 meters across the bottom, narrowing up to 5 meters across the top. Wangjinglou is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, rising 980 meters above sea level.                     "" South East of Jinshanling, is the Mutianyu Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for approximately 2.25 kilometers (about 1.3 miles). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east.                     Another notable section lies near the eastern extremity of the wall where the first pass of the Great Wall was located on the Shanhaiguan (known as the Number One Pass Under Heaven), the first mountain the Great Wall climbs. Jia Shan, is also located here, as is the Jiumenkou, which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge. Shanhaiguan Great Wall is referred to as the Museum of the Construction of the Great Wall, because of a temple, the Meng Jiang-Nu Temple, built during the Song Dynasty.                                           Characteristics                                            Before the use of bricks, the Great Wall was mainly built from earth, stones and wood.                     Bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall during the Ming Dynasty, as well as materials such as tiles, lime, and stone. Bricks were easier to work with than earth and stone as their small size and light weight made them convenient to carry and augmented construction speed. Additionally, they could bear more weight and retain their integrity better than rammed earth. Stone, though more difficult to use, can better hold well under its own weight than brick. Consequently, stones cut in rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer brims, and gateways of the wall.                     The steps that form the Great Wall of China are very steep and tall in some areas of the wall. Tourists often become exhausted climbing the wall and traverse no more than a mile because of this reason. Along the wall on either side, are holes where the builders of the Great Wall didnt place any bricks. They are a little over a foot tall, and about 9 inches in width. These holes were used to shoot arrows out of when being attacked.                                           Condition                                             While some portions near tourist centers have been preserved and even reconstructed, in many locations the Wall is in disrepair, serving as a playground for some villages and a source of stones to rebuild houses and roads. Sections of the Wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism. Parts have been destroyed because the Wall is in the way of construction sites. Intact or repaired portions of the Wall near developed tourist areas are often plagued with hawkers of tourist kitsch.                                       After one of the many runs for charity along the Great Wall, H.J.P Arnold questioned several runners about the status of the wall. A typical response was ""The wall was clearly discernible and only moderately eroded along 22% of the run. The Wall was usually discernible but frequently broken/eroded 41% of the run, and scarcely discernible and almost totally eroded 37% of the run""                                           Watchtowers and barracks                                            The wall also has watch towers at regular intervals, which were used to store weapons, house troops, and send smoke signals. Barracks and administrative centers are located at larger intervals.                     Communication between the army units along the length of the Great Wall, including the ability to call reinforcements and warn garrisons of enemy movements, was of high importance. Signal towers were built upon hill tops or other high points along the wall for their visibility.                                         Recognition                                          The Wall was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987.                     Mao Zedong had a saying, ""You're not a real man if you haven't climbed the Great Wall"". Originally this saying was used to bolster his revolution in trekking north. But due to the erosion of time the saying has been reduced to a promotional slogan for the Great Wall of China. In Badaling (north of Beijing) the 'real man stone' can be found with the saying engraved in it.                                           From outer space                                            Ripley's Believe It or Not! cartoon from May 1932 makes the claim that the wall is ""the mightiest work of man, the only one that would be visible to the human eye from the moon"" and Richard Halliburton's 1938 book Second Book of Marvels makes a similar claim. This belief has persisted, assuming urban legend status, sometimes even entering school textbooks. Arthur Waldron, author of the most authoritative history of the Great Wall, has speculated that the belief might go back to the fascination with the ""canals"" once believed to exist on Mars. (The logic was simple: If people on Earth can see the Martians' canals, the Martians might be able to see the Great Wall.)                     The Great Wall is a maximum 30 feet wide and is about the same color as the soil surrounding it. Based on the optics of resolving power (distance versus the width of the iris: a few millimetres for the human eye, metres for large telescopes) an object of reasonable contrast to its surroundings some four thousand miles in diameter (such as the Australian land mass) would be visible to the unaided eye from the moon. But the Great Wall is of course not a disc but more like a thread, and a thread a foot long would not be visible from a hundred yards away, even though a human head is. Not surprisingly, no lunar astronaunt has ever claimed he could see the Great Wall from the moon.                     A different question is whether it is visible form near-Earth orbit i.e at an altiude of less than 500 km - 0.1% of the distance of the moon. The consensus here is that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other manmade objects.                     Astronaut William Pogue thought he had seen it from Skylab but discovered he was actually looking at the Grand Canal of China near Beijing. He spotted the Great Wall with binoculars, but said that ""it wasn't visible to the unaided eye."" US Senator Jake Garn claimed to be able to see the Great Wall with the naked eye from a space shuttle orbit in the early 1980s, but his claim has been disputed by several US astronauts. Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei said he could not see it at all.                     Veteran US astronaut Gene Cernan has stated: ""At Earth orbit of 160 km to 320 km high, the Great Wall of China is, indeed, visible to the naked eye."" Ed Lu, Expedition 7 Science Officer aboard the International Space Station, adds that, ""it's less visible than a lot of other objects. And you have to know where to look.""                     Neil Armstrong stated about the view from Apollo 11: ""I do not believe that, at least with my eyes, there would be any man-made object that I could see. I have not yet found somebody who has told me they've seen the Wall of China from Earth orbit. ... I've asked various people, particularly Shuttle guys, that have been many orbits around China in the daytime, and the ones I've talked to didn't see it.""                     Leroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the state-run China Daily newspaper concluded that the Great Wall can be seen from space with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look                     These inconsistent results suggest the visibility of the Great Wall from near earth orbit depends greatly on the seeing conditions, and also the direction of the light (oblique lighting widens the shadow). Features on the moon that are dramatically visible at times can be undetectable at other times due to changes in lighting direction; the same would be true of the Great Wall.

The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the space is 'blown-up' by moving the action to the corresponding battleboard type.  After lots of dice are tossed, the victor is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.  The points mean little in and of themselves, but they are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment one small character in the game.  That particular character is the leader of the player's legions: the  Titan .  This is the player's alter-ego, and the Titan's fate and the player's fate are one and the same.    Titan is #2 in the  Valley Games Classic Line

AVERY    December 8, 2008              CHURCHVILLE, VAA North China cave stalagmite just produced an amazingly precise record of Chinas rainfall over the past 1800 years, proving that variations in the suns activitythrough weaker monsoons and poor rice cropshelped bring down three historic Chinese dynasties (the Tang, Yuan, and Ming dynasties).       In contrast, the sun sent abundant rainfall for the Song Dynasty, producing rich rice harvests, social stability, and population growth through the 10 th -13 th  centuriesa period known to the world as the Medieval Warming. The Chinese recorded the Song abundance in both historic documents and cave-wall paintings.      Paleoclimatologists used uranium-thorium dating of the layered deposits in the stalagmite, linking them to the rainfall records within a remarkable 2.5 yearsthus permitting the rainfall-dynastic analysis. Lawrence Edwards of the University of Minnesota was a lead author of the study, published in the journal  Science  November 7, 2008.       The China study found that the cave stalagmite rainfall record followed solar variability even more closely than it followed the northern hemispheres temperatures. A strong correlation was also found between the weak monsoons of the Late Tang Period in China and a Swiss record of Alpine glaciers advancing during the cold temperatures of the 9 th  century. The European glacier advance was followed by Alpine glacial retreat from the late 9 th  to 14 th  centuries, correlating with the Medieval Warming and the Song Dynastys prosperity.       Half a world away, the decline of the Roman Empire is reflected in the layers of a stalagmite from Soreq Cave near Jerusalem. The stalagmite, analyzed with an Ion Mass Spectrometer at the University of Wisconsin, shows the Eastern Mediterranean becoming drier as Roman and Byzantine power waned from 200 AD to 700 AD. The stalagmite record shows especially sharp drops in precipitation about 100 and 400 AD.       Hunger, produced by the extended droughts of the late Roman Warming may have driven the barbarian tribes from Eastern Europe and the Near East to the gates of Rome seeking food. But Rome itself may then have had grain shortages, since the Roman granary in North Africa also tends to get less rainfall as the warm periods wane and the tropical rain belts move back to the south. Without steady supplies of grain, the Roman hold on its Mediterranean Empire was probably doomed.        The stalagmite cores look sort of like tree rings in the cross-section, says co-author Ian Orland, Only instead of looking at the ring widths, were looking at the geochemical composition of each ring.   Oxygen isotopes in the calcium layers and organic matter flushed into the cave by surface rainand trapped in the mineral layerscontain the climate information.      This is a relatively recent way of looking at world history. Scientists have only known about the moderate, solar-driven 1,500-year climate cycle since 1984. Evidence found in ice cores, seabed sediments, ancient tree rings and fossil pollen as well as in cave stalagmites from every continent show it has produced seven previous global warmings since the last Ice Age ended 12,000 years ago. Maureen Raymo of Boston   University found the cycle extending more than one million years in the microfossils of the North Atlantic seabed south of Iceland. ( Nature : 392, 1998)      Researchers are still working to link the physical evidence of warming/cooling shifts to the events of world history while the rest of us watch the unfolding story with awe and anticipation      DENNIS T.

Mao led a small army of peasants to fight the  Kuomintang  and the landlords of Hunan. The uprising was defeated by Kuomintang forces and Mao was forced to retreat to the Jinggang Mountains on the border between  Hunan  and  Jiangxi  province, where emerged an army of  miners . This was the first armed uprising by the Communists, and it marked a significant change in their strategy. Mao and Red Army founder  Zhu De  went on to develop a rural based strategy that centered on guerrilla tactics, paving the way to the  Long March  of 1934.           v      d      e     Chinese Civil War       Main events pre-1945   Main events post-1945   Specific articles           First United Front  (1924)   Shanghai massacre of 1927           Nanchang Uprising   Autumn Harvest Uprising   Guangzhou Uprising           Encirclement Campaigns  (19301934)   Chinese Soviet Republic  (19311934)   Long March  (19341936)   Xi'an Incident  (1936)   Second United Front  (19371946)         Part of the  Cold War       Full-scale Civil War  (19461949)   First Taiwan Strait Crisis  (1955)   Second Taiwan Strait Crisis  (1958)   Third Taiwan Strait Crisis  (1996)   Pan-Blue visits to mainland China  (2005-)           Political status of Taiwan   Legal status of Taiwan   Chinese reunification   Taiwan independence   Cross-Strait relations     Primary participants       Kuomintang of China     Communist Party of China                    This article related to the  History of China  is a  stub .

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that          nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.                                                                                                                                                    We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to          dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who          here gave their lives that the nation might live. It is altogether          fitting and proper that we should do this.                                                                                                                                           But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not          consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living          and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor          power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember          what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for          us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which          they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.                                                                                                                                            It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task          remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased          devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of          devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have          died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of          freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the          people, shall not perish from the earth.                                                        I f          you enjoyed  The Gettysburg Address,            please share this email audio greeting card with your friends.                                                                       click here                               The History of the          Gettysburg Address                     In June of 1863, the United States was involved in a civil war.           Confederate General Robert E. Lee invaded the North and met the Union          troops in the bloodiest battle of the Civil War at Gettysburg.            The battle lasted for three days, and the Union troops did not yield.           Without sufficient troops to continue the battle, General Lee retreated          to Virginia, leaving behind more than 3,000 dead.  Union losses          were almost as heavy, numbering 2,500.  Most of the bodies were          buried where they fell.           A few weeks after the battle, the governor of Pennsylvania walked          over the battlefield and saw where rains had washed away the earth          covering many of the fallen soldiers. He said the men who died so          bravely should have a better resting place.            The governor said a new cemetery should be built for the bodies of          the Union soldiers. He asked the northern states to help raise money.          Within a month, there was money and work began almost immediately.                     The governor planned a ceremony to dedicate the Gettysburg cemetery.          He invited governors and congressmen from each state in the Union and          asked a former senator and governor of Massachusetts, Edward Everett, to          give the dedication speech.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Abraham Lincoln                                 An invitation was also sent to President Lincoln asking him to come          and say a few words.             Lincoln agreed to do so. He felt it was his duty to go.  Perhaps          his words might ease the sorrow over the loss of the soldiers and lift          the spirit of the nation.            Lincoln did not have much time to work on his speech, and he left          Washington by train on November eighteenth.  The train stopped in          Baltimore and an old man came up and told the president that he had lost          a son at Gettysburg.            Extending his sympathy, Lincoln responded: ""When I think of the          sacrifices of life still to be offered, and the hearts and homes to be          made lonely before this terrible war is over, my heart is like lead. I          feel at times like hiding in a deep darkness.""           Lincoln arrived at Gettysburg at sundown and had dinner. Then he went          to his room and worked for several hours to complete his speech.            The next morning, riding a horse, Lincoln led the parade to the new          cemetery where there was a huge crowd..              The ceremonies began with a prayer. Then Edward Everett rose to          speak.                                                      Everett stood                silent for a moment. He looked out across the battlefield and the                crowds that now covered it. He began to talk about the Civil War                and what had caused it. He told how northern cities would have                fallen had Lee not been stopped at Gettysburg. He praised the men                who had given their lives in the great battle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Edward Everett                                                                                                                     Everett spoke for almost two hours and closed his speech with the          hope that the nation would come out of the war with greater unity than          ever before.            Then Lincoln stood up. He looked out over the Gettysburg valley and          then down at the papers in his hand. He began to read his address.           After he concluded, the crowd applauded for several minutes and then          began to leave.            Lincoln turned to a friend and said his speech had been a failure. He          said he should have prepared it more carefully.                                                      Edward Everett did not agree.                He said the president's speech was perfect. According to Everett,                the president had said more in two minutes than he, Everett, had                said in two hours.                Newspapers and other publications also praised Lincoln's                address. One publication said: ""The few words of the president                were from the heart, to the heart. They cannot be read without                emotion.""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Abraham Lincoln went back to Washington that night feeling quite          tired. Within a week, his secretary announced that he was suffering from          smallpox.

It's been a bit of a wait, but Children of the Nile™ - Enhanced Edition is  now available for purchase on Steam !  We're thrilled to be able to bring CotN directly to gamers in this way, and to be able to maintain the kind of connection with our audience that has always been at the heart of the PC gaming experience. If you already own the original CotN, you can get the enhancements for free via  the updates page .   We've also created a  new game demo  that features a ""quick start"" learning scenario, allowing new users to jump right in and start building Egyptian cities, while also showing the new features of the enhanced edition ( see full list of enhancement features ).    Tilted Mill remains committed to the CotN franchise, and will continue to develop the series in the coming months. Until then, enjoy the enhanced edition!    July 3rd, 2008   Gamasutra Interview  Gamasutra has posted  an interview  with Chris Beatrice regarding the reacquisition of Children of the Nile, its future, and the state of the PC gaming industry.    May 28th, 2008   News Update  Tilted Mill is humbled by, and grateful for, the feedback we have gotten from our fans on this site and other venues, and therefore we'd like to share some exciting news with you.   The studio is currently in the process of enhancing the original CotN game for re-release very soon, and these enhancements will of course be made available to existing players free of charge. We don't want to overstate the scope of these enhancements - at this stage we are primarily focused on improving accessibility, and feedback issues, but a few new buildings / decorations have also been included (such as the 'Brickyard,' which allows you to quickly and easily place large amounts of bricks near construction sites, greatly accelerating the speed with which you can build your city). Part of this free update will be a new demo which we feel does a much better (and faster!) job of representing what is fun and unique about CotN, as well as showcasing the new enhancements, so for those of you who have not tried the game, please wait until the new demo is released.   We believe in supporting our products as best we can post release, and are therefore also in the process of creating a series of content packs for CotN that will always be well worth the loaf of bread to barter for. Depending on demand we will expand or contract this series going forward.   Thank you all for being part of our journey!   -Chris Beatrice    April 16th, 2008   Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile Update  Tilted Mill believes passionately in Children of the Nile and remains committed to developing the Immortal Cities series further. To that end, the company is going to be supporting existing fans with some new goodies, and will also be bringing the game and series as a whole to new players who may not have gotten a chance to partake of what we continue to feel is a unique and refreshing city building experience.    We'll be providing more information on specific products and timing in the coming weeks, so please check back!    April 3rd, 2008   Children of the Nile is Back!  Like Osiris returning from the land of the dead, the Official Children of the Nile website has returned!
