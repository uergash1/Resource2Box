He moved to the United States in 1852 and founded a settlement at Gum Pond after living in Ohio. In 1880, he opened a post office and had thus to name the village. In memory of his native home he called it  Stuttgart  after  Stuttgart  in  Germany . In 1882, the railroad was opened. Stuttgart became a city in 1884, and in 1904, rice farming was first introduced in the Stuttgart area.     [ edit ]   2008 Tornado   On  May 10 ,  2008  at about 10:30 pm ET,  a large EF3 tornado  struck Stuttgart and destroyed several homes and buildings and injured 9 people. The tornado was featured on an episode of  Storm Chasers  on  November 9 ,  2008 .

[ 4 ]   According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 6.2 square miles (16.0 km), none of which is covered by water. Hard  clay  underlying the area's  topsoil  is what makes Stuttgart a good place to grow rice, which grows best in flooded fields made possible by the clay. The geography is mainly flat with no outstanding mountainous features with the exception of ""WBA Mountain"", a small artificial mound located west of the city.     [ edit ]   Demographics   As of the  census [ 5 ]  of 2000, there were 9,745 people, 3,994 households, and 2,731 families residing in the city.

Additionally, the city gained a bit of attention during the  sixth cycle  of  America's Next Top Model  in the spring of 2006 when Stuttgart resident Furonda Brasfield was featured among the contestants.   A tornado that struck Stuttgart was featured on the November 9th, 2008 episode of  Storm Chasers  on the  Discovery Channel  when the DOW-6 and TornadoVideos.net teams chase a storm into the town.

[ edit ]   History   The Harrisonville area was originally inhabited by the ""Dhegilha"" Indians subgroup. Being of Siouan linguistic stock, the  Osage ,  Quapaw ,  Omaha ,  Ponca  and  Kansa  tribes comprise this subgroup.   The Kansa tribal range extended southward from the Kansas-Missouri River junction as far as the northern edge of Bates County, Missouri, taking in the sites of modern Pleasant Hill, Garden City, Archie and Drexel. On their southeastern border they were neighbors of the Osage, although there is no evidence that either of these tribes ever had a truly permanent settlement in the territory of Cass County.   At early camp meetings southwest of Harrisonville after Americans came, as many as five hundred Indians were often in attendance and seemed to enjoy religious services as much as the whites [ citation needed ] , with whom they mingled on such occasions. These Indians were reportedly  Shawnees  and  Delawares , both of  Algonquian  linguistic stock.   In 1818 a grant of land in southern Missouri was made to some Delawares, but it was re-ceded by them in 1825, and most of them moved to a reservation in Kansas, while others had previously gone to Texas. Those who remained in the Harrisonville area were close relatives of the  Sauk ,  Fox  and  Kickapoo  tribes.   The first American settler on the site of modern Harrisonville was James Lackey, in 1830. Others early settlers were Humphrey Hunt, John Blythe and Dr. Joseph Hudspeth. Lackey was considered a ""squatter"", as he built a cabin and enclosed a small field on the tract of public land taken for county seat purposes.   Site of the town was fixed under an act of the Missouri General Assembly in 1835, by David Waldo of Lafayette County and Samual Hink and William Brown, both of Jackson County. In the same year, the first court met for the county, known as Van Buren County. The Justices James McClellan and William Savage, met in McClellan's residence about three miles (5 km) southeast of Peculiar on September 14, 1835. William Lyon was appointed clerk of the court and county government was organized , included the setting up of Grand River Township.   In the spring of 1837 the town of Harrisonville was located by Enoch Rice, Francis Prine and Welcome Scott, who had been appointed commissioners by the state legislature in the winter of 1836. These commissioners in company with Matin Rice, the county surveyor, met at the home of John Cook on April 3, 1837 and finally decided on Lackey's pre-emption claim. In May they laid off the town in lots 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the northeast and northwest quarters of Section 4, Township 44N., Range 31W. Within these 160 acres (0.65 km 2 ) there were to be four streets: Wall and Pearl running east to west, Lexington and Independence going north and south, each less than forty feet wide. Fleming Harris was appointed as town commissioner on April 8, 1837. The first town lots were sold on June 12 of that year; those facing the public square sold at $20 each, the others at $10.   ""Democrat"" was strongly urged as a name for the new town but was finally rejected. Instead, the town was named after Albert G. Harrison, a U.S. representative from Missouri.   On October 8, 1835 the first Harrisonville church was organized in the county two miles southwest of town known as Hopewell or New Hope Baptist.   The first house within the town was erected by Jason L. Dickey in 1836.   The first jail in Harrisonville and second for the county was established in 1838. Its site was 312 S. Independence. One of its successors is listed among the state's historic sites.   Harrisonville eventually was served by railroad lines presently known as the Missouri Pacific and the Frisco. Railroad construction was responsible for the notorious ""Gunn City Massacre"", the background of which began in 1857. Cass County approved a large stock subscription for the Pacific Railroad Company. This corporation later surrendered the bonds to the new Saint Louis and Santa Fe Railroad, from whence they were still later assigned to the Land Grant Railroad & Construction Company of New York. Citizens of Cass County sought by injunction to prevent the funding of these bonds, but by legal maneuvering and collusion, a new set of bonds was issued secretly. Basically the outraged populace viewed this development as a sophisticated maneuver to benefit the holders of bonds that had become worthless by re-obligating the county to pay those same bonds. Three men who helped to perpetrate this swindle, including the county attorney and a judge of the county court, were shot and killed on April 24, 1872 while on board a Katy railroad spur between Bryson, Missouri and Paola, Kansas (in or near what is now known as Gunn City). Forty-one men were arrested and brought to trial for these killings, but there were no convictions. At the time of the shootings, a Republican newspaper, belonging to Mr. Porter J. Coston, in Harrisonville, Missouri, was burned by the same mob. [ 3 ]   [ 4 ]   The year before the Civil War, twelve cities in Missouri had population of approx. 2500 or more. Harrisonville ranked 37th with a population of 675. In 1863 the town was depopulated, and most of the buildings burned, the jail among them . Fort Harrisonville was a Union stronghold for a brief period in 1863 and provided protection for loyal Union families.

The  Census Bureau  estimated its population at 81,913 in 2006, [ 3 ]  making it the sixth-largest city in the  Kansas City Metropolitan Area  and the sixth-largest city in Missouri. In 2006 CNN/Money and  Money  magazine ranked Lee's Summit 44th on its list of the 100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.

From the  1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri .       Founded as the ""Town of Strother"", by William B. Howard for his wife, Maria D. Strother (daughter of William D. Strother formally of  Bardstown, Kentucky ). Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from  Kentucky , married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had 833 acres (3.37 km 2 ) and a homestead five miles (8 km) north of town. He was arrested for being a  Confederate  in October of 1862, near the beginning of the  Civil War , and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the  Missouri Pacific Railroad  was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with 70 acres (280,000 m 2 ) in the fall of 1865. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   In 1865 the town changed it's name for early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who moved to Jackson County in 1849, from  Bradley County, Tennessee . Lea was listed as the postmaster of Big Cedar in the 1855  United States Official Postal Guide . [ 7 ]  Dr. Lea was killed in August of 1862 by  Kansas Jayhawkers  (or Redlegs). [ 8 ]   When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of ""Lea's Summit"", the ""summit"" portion to reflect its relatively highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. [ 5 ]  But they misspelled the name ""Lees Summit"" (with two ""e's""; ""Lee"" instead of ""Lea""; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, [ 9 ]  then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. [ 10 ]  Also the named was misspelled on the stone culvert near the station, on the side of the Missouri Pacific depot, but on the other side it was spelled correctly, accordingly the railroad used this spelling, as did travelers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Others, those with Southern sympathies, claim that the town was named after famed Civil War General  Robert E. Lee  after Southerners began moving north into Missouri after the war. [ 5 ]  Attributed to a misquote in the  Louisville Journal , January 3, 1866. [ 10 ]   Since the name was already being circulated and published with two ""e's"", the town petitioned the state capitol and incorporated its name in 1868 as: ""Town of Lee's Summit"". [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Lee's Summit in the early 20th century       In 1912, R.A. Long, the owner of a  lumber  company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of  Kansas City . When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the 1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ). The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary, and the site of Longview Community College. The church and mansion are on the  National Register of Historic Places . Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. [ 5 ]   In March 2006, a new City Hall was dedicated replacing one that was considered insufficient for the size of the city. The downtown city hall construction had closed portions of 2nd street, Main Street, and Green Street. Currently, the city is working on a streetscaping project for downtown called ""Diggin It"".

The  Census Bureau  estimated its population at 81,913 in 2006, [ 3 ]  making it the sixth-largest city in the  Kansas City Metropolitan Area  and the sixth-largest city in Missouri. In 2006 CNN/Money and  Money  magazine ranked Lee's Summit 44th on its list of the 100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.

From the  1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri .       Founded as the ""Town of Strother"", by William B. Howard for his wife, Maria D. Strother (daughter of William D. Strother formally of  Bardstown, Kentucky ). Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from  Kentucky , married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had 833 acres (3.37 km 2 ) and a homestead five miles (8 km) north of town. He was arrested for being a  Confederate  in October of 1862, near the beginning of the  Civil War , and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the  Missouri Pacific Railroad  was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with 70 acres (280,000 m 2 ) in the fall of 1865. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   In 1865 the town changed it's name for early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who moved to Jackson County in 1849, from  Bradley County, Tennessee . Lea was listed as the postmaster of Big Cedar in the 1855  United States Official Postal Guide . [ 7 ]  Dr. Lea was killed in August of 1862 by  Kansas Jayhawkers  (or Redlegs). [ 8 ]   When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of ""Lea's Summit"", the ""summit"" portion to reflect its relatively highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. [ 5 ]  But they misspelled the name ""Lees Summit"" (with two ""e's""; ""Lee"" instead of ""Lea""; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, [ 9 ]  then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. [ 10 ]  Also the named was misspelled on the stone culvert near the station, on the side of the Missouri Pacific depot, but on the other side it was spelled correctly, accordingly the railroad used this spelling, as did travelers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Others, those with Southern sympathies, claim that the town was named after famed Civil War General  Robert E. Lee  after Southerners began moving north into Missouri after the war. [ 5 ]  Attributed to a misquote in the  Louisville Journal , January 3, 1866. [ 10 ]   Since the name was already being circulated and published with two ""e's"", the town petitioned the state capitol and incorporated its name in 1868 as: ""Town of Lee's Summit"". [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Lee's Summit in the early 20th century       In 1912, R.A. Long, the owner of a  lumber  company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of  Kansas City . When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the 1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ). The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary, and the site of Longview Community College. The church and mansion are on the  National Register of Historic Places . Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. [ 5 ]   In March 2006, a new City Hall was dedicated replacing one that was considered insufficient for the size of the city. The downtown city hall construction had closed portions of 2nd street, Main Street, and Green Street. Currently, the city is working on a streetscaping project for downtown called ""Diggin It"".

The  Census Bureau  estimated its population at 81,913 in 2006, [ 3 ]  making it the sixth-largest city in the  Kansas City Metropolitan Area  and the sixth-largest city in Missouri. In 2006 CNN/Money and  Money  magazine ranked Lee's Summit 44th on its list of the 100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.

From the  1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri .       Founded as the ""Town of Strother"", by William B. Howard for his wife, Maria D. Strother (daughter of William D. Strother formally of  Bardstown, Kentucky ). Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from  Kentucky , married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had 833 acres (3.37 km 2 ) and a homestead five miles (8 km) north of town. He was arrested for being a  Confederate  in October of 1862, near the beginning of the  Civil War , and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the  Missouri Pacific Railroad  was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with 70 acres (280,000 m 2 ) in the fall of 1865. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   In 1865 the town changed it's name for early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who moved to Jackson County in 1849, from  Bradley County, Tennessee . Lea was listed as the postmaster of Big Cedar in the 1855  United States Official Postal Guide . [ 7 ]  Dr. Lea was killed in August of 1862 by  Kansas Jayhawkers  (or Redlegs). [ 8 ]   When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of ""Lea's Summit"", the ""summit"" portion to reflect its relatively highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. [ 5 ]  But they misspelled the name ""Lees Summit"" (with two ""e's""; ""Lee"" instead of ""Lea""; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, [ 9 ]  then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. [ 10 ]  Also the named was misspelled on the stone culvert near the station, on the side of the Missouri Pacific depot, but on the other side it was spelled correctly, accordingly the railroad used this spelling, as did travelers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Others, those with Southern sympathies, claim that the town was named after famed Civil War General  Robert E. Lee  after Southerners began moving north into Missouri after the war. [ 5 ]  Attributed to a misquote in the  Louisville Journal , January 3, 1866. [ 10 ]   Since the name was already being circulated and published with two ""e's"", the town petitioned the state capitol and incorporated its name in 1868 as: ""Town of Lee's Summit"". [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Lee's Summit in the early 20th century       In 1912, R.A. Long, the owner of a  lumber  company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of  Kansas City . When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the 1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ). The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary, and the site of Longview Community College. The church and mansion are on the  National Register of Historic Places . Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. [ 5 ]   In March 2006, a new City Hall was dedicated replacing one that was considered insufficient for the size of the city. The downtown city hall construction had closed portions of 2nd street, Main Street, and Green Street. Currently, the city is working on a streetscaping project for downtown called ""Diggin It"".

Contents       1   History   2   Geography   3   Demographics   4   Trivia   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   History   French Lick was originally a  French   trading post . A fortified ranger post was established near the springs in 1811. On an 1835 map of Indiana, the community was known as Salt Spring. The town was founded in 1857.   The  sulfur  springs were commercially exploited for medical benefits starting in 1840. By the later half of the 19th century, French Lick was famous in the United States as a  spa town . In the early 20th century it also featured  casinos  attracting celebrities like boxer  Joe Louis , composer  Irving Berlin  and gangster  Al Capone .   In 1943, the  Chicago Cubs  held  Spring Training  camp in French Lick. In order to conserve rail transport during  World War II , the 1943  Spring Training  was limited to an area east of the  Mississippi River  and north of the  Ohio River .  [ 3 ]   The  French Lick Resort Casino  was the focal point of most of the entertainment; the hotel remained open well after the casinos were closed down and the heyday of the town was well past. The resort closed for renovation in 2005.   Pluto Water , a best selling  laxative  of the first half of the 20th century, was bottled here. It was also home to a large  7-Up  bottling facility, which ceased operation in the mid-20th century.   Franklin D. Roosevelt  announced his intention to run for president at a National Governors' Convention held at the French Lick Springs Hotel.   Ever since his professional basketball career took off, the town has been best known for being the hometown of  NBA  great  Larry Bird . French Lick is also the  hometown  of former  Sacramento Kings   head coach   Jerry Reynolds , who currently works as the team's  color commentator  on its television broadcasts and is the Kings' director of player personnel.

The  Census Bureau  estimated its population at 81,913 in 2006, [ 3 ]  making it the sixth-largest city in the  Kansas City Metropolitan Area  and the sixth-largest city in Missouri. In 2006 CNN/Money and  Money  magazine ranked Lee's Summit 44th on its list of the 100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.

From the  1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri .       Founded as the ""Town of Strother"", by William B. Howard for his wife, Maria D. Strother (daughter of William D. Strother formally of  Bardstown, Kentucky ). Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from  Kentucky , married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had 833 acres (3.37 km 2 ) and a homestead five miles (8 km) north of town. He was arrested for being a  Confederate  in October of 1862, near the beginning of the  Civil War , and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the  Missouri Pacific Railroad  was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with 70 acres (280,000 m 2 ) in the fall of 1865. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   In 1865 the town changed it's name for early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who moved to Jackson County in 1849, from  Bradley County, Tennessee . Lea was listed as the postmaster of Big Cedar in the 1855  United States Official Postal Guide . [ 7 ]  Dr. Lea was killed in August of 1862 by  Kansas Jayhawkers  (or Redlegs). [ 8 ]   When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of ""Lea's Summit"", the ""summit"" portion to reflect its relatively highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. [ 5 ]  But they misspelled the name ""Lees Summit"" (with two ""e's""; ""Lee"" instead of ""Lea""; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, [ 9 ]  then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. [ 10 ]  Also the named was misspelled on the stone culvert near the station, on the side of the Missouri Pacific depot, but on the other side it was spelled correctly, accordingly the railroad used this spelling, as did travelers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Others, those with Southern sympathies, claim that the town was named after famed Civil War General  Robert E. Lee  after Southerners began moving north into Missouri after the war. [ 5 ]  Attributed to a misquote in the  Louisville Journal , January 3, 1866. [ 10 ]   Since the name was already being circulated and published with two ""e's"", the town petitioned the state capitol and incorporated its name in 1868 as: ""Town of Lee's Summit"". [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Lee's Summit in the early 20th century       In 1912, R.A. Long, the owner of a  lumber  company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of  Kansas City . When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the 1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ). The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary, and the site of Longview Community College. The church and mansion are on the  National Register of Historic Places . Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. [ 5 ]   In March 2006, a new City Hall was dedicated replacing one that was considered insufficient for the size of the city. The downtown city hall construction had closed portions of 2nd street, Main Street, and Green Street. Currently, the city is working on a streetscaping project for downtown called ""Diggin It"".

In 2006 CNN/Money and  Money  magazine ranked Lee's Summit 44th on its list of the 100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.

From the  1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri .       Founded as the ""Town of Strother"", by William B. Howard for his wife, Maria D. Strother (daughter of William D. Strother formally of  Bardstown, Kentucky ). Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from  Kentucky , married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had 833 acres (3.37 km 2 ) and a homestead five miles (8 km) north of town. He was arrested for being a  Confederate  in October of 1862, near the beginning of the  Civil War , and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the  Missouri Pacific Railroad  was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with 70 acres (280,000 m 2 ) in the fall of 1865. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   In 1865 the town changed it's name for early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who moved to Jackson County in 1849, from  Bradley County, Tennessee . Lea was listed as the postmaster of Big Cedar in the 1855  United States Official Postal Guide . [ 7 ]  Dr. Lea was killed in August of 1862 by  Kansas Jayhawkers  (or Redlegs). [ 8 ]   When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of ""Lea's Summit"", the ""summit"" portion to reflect its relatively highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. [ 5 ]  But they misspelled the name ""Lees Summit"" (with two ""e's""; ""Lee"" instead of ""Lea""; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, [ 9 ]  then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. [ 10 ]  Also the named was misspelled on the stone culvert near the station, on the side of the Missouri Pacific depot, but on the other side it was spelled correctly, accordingly the railroad used this spelling, as did travelers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Others, those with Southern sympathies, claim that the town was named after famed Civil War General  Robert E. Lee  after Southerners began moving north into Missouri after the war. [ 5 ]  Attributed to a misquote in the  Louisville Journal , January 3, 1866. [ 10 ]   Since the name was already being circulated and published with two ""e's"", the town petitioned the state capitol and incorporated its name in 1868 as: ""Town of Lee's Summit"". [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Lee's Summit in the early 20th century       In 1912, R.A. Long, the owner of a  lumber  company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of  Kansas City . When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the 1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ). The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary, and the site of Longview Community College. The church and mansion are on the  National Register of Historic Places . Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. [ 5 ]   In March 2006, a new City Hall was dedicated replacing one that was considered insufficient for the size of the city. The downtown city hall construction had closed portions of 2nd street, Main Street, and Green Street. Currently, the city is working on a streetscaping project for downtown called ""Diggin It"".

[ edit ]   History   The Harrisonville area was originally inhabited by the ""Dhegilha"" Indians subgroup. Being of Siouan linguistic stock, the  Osage ,  Quapaw ,  Omaha ,  Ponca  and  Kansa  tribes comprise this subgroup.   The Kansa tribal range extended southward from the Kansas-Missouri River junction as far as the northern edge of Bates County, Missouri, taking in the sites of modern Pleasant Hill, Garden City, Archie and Drexel. On their southeastern border they were neighbors of the Osage, although there is no evidence that either of these tribes ever had a truly permanent settlement in the territory of Cass County.   At early camp meetings southwest of Harrisonville after Americans came, as many as five hundred Indians were often in attendance and seemed to enjoy religious services as much as the whites [ citation needed ] , with whom they mingled on such occasions. These Indians were reportedly  Shawnees  and  Delawares , both of  Algonquian  linguistic stock.   In 1818 a grant of land in southern Missouri was made to some Delawares, but it was re-ceded by them in 1825, and most of them moved to a reservation in Kansas, while others had previously gone to Texas. Those who remained in the Harrisonville area were close relatives of the  Sauk ,  Fox  and  Kickapoo  tribes.   The first American settler on the site of modern Harrisonville was James Lackey, in 1830. Others early settlers were Humphrey Hunt, John Blythe and Dr. Joseph Hudspeth. Lackey was considered a ""squatter"", as he built a cabin and enclosed a small field on the tract of public land taken for county seat purposes.   Site of the town was fixed under an act of the Missouri General Assembly in 1835, by David Waldo of Lafayette County and Samual Hink and William Brown, both of Jackson County. In the same year, the first court met for the county, known as Van Buren County. The Justices James McClellan and William Savage, met in McClellan's residence about three miles (5 km) southeast of Peculiar on September 14, 1835. William Lyon was appointed clerk of the court and county government was organized , included the setting up of Grand River Township.   In the spring of 1837 the town of Harrisonville was located by Enoch Rice, Francis Prine and Welcome Scott, who had been appointed commissioners by the state legislature in the winter of 1836. These commissioners in company with Matin Rice, the county surveyor, met at the home of John Cook on April 3, 1837 and finally decided on Lackey's pre-emption claim. In May they laid off the town in lots 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the northeast and northwest quarters of Section 4, Township 44N., Range 31W. Within these 160 acres (0.65 km 2 ) there were to be four streets: Wall and Pearl running east to west, Lexington and Independence going north and south, each less than forty feet wide. Fleming Harris was appointed as town commissioner on April 8, 1837. The first town lots were sold on June 12 of that year; those facing the public square sold at $20 each, the others at $10.   ""Democrat"" was strongly urged as a name for the new town but was finally rejected. Instead, the town was named after Albert G. Harrison, a U.S. representative from Missouri.   On October 8, 1835 the first Harrisonville church was organized in the county two miles southwest of town known as Hopewell or New Hope Baptist.   The first house within the town was erected by Jason L. Dickey in 1836.   The first jail in Harrisonville and second for the county was established in 1838. Its site was 312 S. Independence. One of its successors is listed among the state's historic sites.   Harrisonville eventually was served by railroad lines presently known as the Missouri Pacific and the Frisco. Railroad construction was responsible for the notorious ""Gunn City Massacre"", the background of which began in 1857. Cass County approved a large stock subscription for the Pacific Railroad Company. This corporation later surrendered the bonds to the new Saint Louis and Santa Fe Railroad, from whence they were still later assigned to the Land Grant Railroad & Construction Company of New York. Citizens of Cass County sought by injunction to prevent the funding of these bonds, but by legal maneuvering and collusion, a new set of bonds was issued secretly. Basically the outraged populace viewed this development as a sophisticated maneuver to benefit the holders of bonds that had become worthless by re-obligating the county to pay those same bonds. Three men who helped to perpetrate this swindle, including the county attorney and a judge of the county court, were shot and killed on April 24, 1872 while on board a Katy railroad spur between Bryson, Missouri and Paola, Kansas (in or near what is now known as Gunn City). Forty-one men were arrested and brought to trial for these killings, but there were no convictions. At the time of the shootings, a Republican newspaper, belonging to Mr. Porter J. Coston, in Harrisonville, Missouri, was burned by the same mob. [ 3 ]   [ 4 ]   The year before the Civil War, twelve cities in Missouri had population of approx. 2500 or more. Harrisonville ranked 37th with a population of 675. In 1863 the town was depopulated, and most of the buildings burned, the jail among them . Fort Harrisonville was a Union stronghold for a brief period in 1863 and provided protection for loyal Union families.

The population was 3,890 at the  2000 census . It is part of the  Bangor ,  Maine   Metropolitan Statistical Area . It is located at  450127N   691723W  /  45.02417N 69.28972W  /  45.02417; -69.28972  (45.0242, -69.2899) [ 1 ] , beside Lake Wassookeag at the intersection of Routes  7  and  23 .

When incorporated as a town in 1816, it named itself after  Samuel Dexter , who was then running for  governor of Massachusetts  (which Maine was a territory of). The town of  Brooks ,  Maine  in nearby  Waldo County , was incorporated the same year and named for the opposing candidate,  John Brooks . Brooks won the election. The town of Dexter, however, achieved the greater prosperity.   The town grew because of its location on the East Branch of the Sebasticook River, which provided excellent  water power  for mills. In 1818, Jonathan Farrar constructed a grist mill at the falls. The  Dexter Historical Society  today uses the building which replaced it in 1854 as part of its museum complex. The stream would also power 5 woolen mills, the oldest and largest of which was established by Amos and Jeremiah Abbott in 1836.  Amos Abbott & Company  , which closed in 1975, was the only textile mill in the  United States  to be owned by one family for such a long period.   Dexter's downtown is dominated by the  Memorial Building , designed by John Morrison. At its top is the community's largest clock, named ""Nancy"" after the architect's wife. The tallest building in town is the  Unitarian Universalist  Church. It is also Dexter's oldest house of worship, built in 1826, but given a new steeple and vestibule by  Boston  architect  Thomas W. Silloway  in 1869. Five buildings in Dexter are listed on the  National Register of Historic Places , including the  Grist Mill ;  Universalist Church ;  The Abbott Memorial Library  by  Boston  architect J. William Beal;  The Bank Block  by  Bangor  architect George W. Orff; and  Zion's Hill , the  Ralph Owen Brewster  House by  Portland  architectural firm  Stevens and Stevens .   In 1848 the town was visited by a  tornado  which tore large trees out by their roots and destroyed even the strongest buildings.

When incorporated as a town in 1816, it named itself after  Samuel Dexter , who was then running for  governor of Massachusetts  (which Maine was a territory of). The town of  Brooks ,  Maine  in nearby  Waldo County , was incorporated the same year and named for the opposing candidate,  John Brooks . Brooks won the election. The town of Dexter, however, achieved the greater prosperity.   The town grew because of its location on the East Branch of the Sebasticook River, which provided excellent  water power  for mills. In 1818, Jonathan Farrar constructed a grist mill at the falls. The  Dexter Historical Society  today uses the building which replaced it in 1854 as part of its museum complex. The stream would also power 5 woolen mills, the oldest and largest of which was established by Amos and Jeremiah Abbott in 1836.  Amos Abbott & Company  , which closed in 1975, was the only textile mill in the  United States  to be owned by one family for such a long period.   Dexter's downtown is dominated by the  Memorial Building , designed by John Morrison. At its top is the community's largest clock, named ""Nancy"" after the architect's wife. The tallest building in town is the  Unitarian Universalist  Church. It is also Dexter's oldest house of worship, built in 1826, but given a new steeple and vestibule by  Boston  architect  Thomas W. Silloway  in 1869. Five buildings in Dexter are listed on the  National Register of Historic Places , including the  Grist Mill ;  Universalist Church ;  The Abbott Memorial Library  by  Boston  architect J. William Beal;  The Bank Block  by  Bangor  architect George W. Orff; and  Zion's Hill , the  Ralph Owen Brewster  House by  Portland  architectural firm  Stevens and Stevens .   In 1848 the town was visited by a  tornado  which tore large trees out by their roots and destroyed even the strongest buildings.

The population was 3,890 at the  2000 census . It is part of the  Bangor ,  Maine   Metropolitan Statistical Area . It is located at  450127N   691723W  /  45.02417N 69.28972W  /  45.02417; -69.28972  (45.0242, -69.2899) [ 1 ] , beside Lake Wassookeag at the intersection of Routes  7  and  23 .

When incorporated as a town in 1816, it named itself after  Samuel Dexter , who was then running for  governor of Massachusetts  (which Maine was a territory of). The town of  Brooks ,  Maine  in nearby  Waldo County , was incorporated the same year and named for the opposing candidate,  John Brooks . Brooks won the election. The town of Dexter, however, achieved the greater prosperity.   The town grew because of its location on the East Branch of the Sebasticook River, which provided excellent  water power  for mills. In 1818, Jonathan Farrar constructed a grist mill at the falls. The  Dexter Historical Society  today uses the building which replaced it in 1854 as part of its museum complex. The stream would also power 5 woolen mills, the oldest and largest of which was established by Amos and Jeremiah Abbott in 1836.  Amos Abbott & Company  , which closed in 1975, was the only textile mill in the  United States  to be owned by one family for such a long period.   Dexter's downtown is dominated by the  Memorial Building , designed by John Morrison. At its top is the community's largest clock, named ""Nancy"" after the architect's wife. The tallest building in town is the  Unitarian Universalist  Church. It is also Dexter's oldest house of worship, built in 1826, but given a new steeple and vestibule by  Boston  architect  Thomas W. Silloway  in 1869. Five buildings in Dexter are listed on the  National Register of Historic Places , including the  Grist Mill ;  Universalist Church ;  The Abbott Memorial Library  by  Boston  architect J. William Beal;  The Bank Block  by  Bangor  architect George W. Orff; and  Zion's Hill , the  Ralph Owen Brewster  House by  Portland  architectural firm  Stevens and Stevens .   In 1848 the town was visited by a  tornado  which tore large trees out by their roots and destroyed even the strongest buildings.

When incorporated as a town in 1816, it named itself after  Samuel Dexter , who was then running for  governor of Massachusetts  (which Maine was a territory of). The town of  Brooks ,  Maine  in nearby  Waldo County , was incorporated the same year and named for the opposing candidate,  John Brooks . Brooks won the election. The town of Dexter, however, achieved the greater prosperity.   The town grew because of its location on the East Branch of the Sebasticook River, which provided excellent  water power  for mills. In 1818, Jonathan Farrar constructed a grist mill at the falls. The  Dexter Historical Society  today uses the building which replaced it in 1854 as part of its museum complex. The stream would also power 5 woolen mills, the oldest and largest of which was established by Amos and Jeremiah Abbott in 1836.  Amos Abbott & Company  , which closed in 1975, was the only textile mill in the  United States  to be owned by one family for such a long period.   Dexter's downtown is dominated by the  Memorial Building , designed by John Morrison. At its top is the community's largest clock, named ""Nancy"" after the architect's wife. The tallest building in town is the  Unitarian Universalist  Church. It is also Dexter's oldest house of worship, built in 1826, but given a new steeple and vestibule by  Boston  architect  Thomas W. Silloway  in 1869. Five buildings in Dexter are listed on the  National Register of Historic Places , including the  Grist Mill ;  Universalist Church ;  The Abbott Memorial Library  by  Boston  architect J. William Beal;  The Bank Block  by  Bangor  architect George W. Orff; and  Zion's Hill , the  Ralph Owen Brewster  House by  Portland  architectural firm  Stevens and Stevens .   In 1848 the town was visited by a  tornado  which tore large trees out by their roots and destroyed even the strongest buildings.

It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the district  Gro-Gerau  ( Hesse ), the city of  Worms  and the districts of  Bad Drkheim ,  Donnersbergkreis ,  Bad Kreuznach  and  Mainz-Bingen .           Contents       1   History   2   Geography   3   Coat of arms   4   Towns and municipalities   5   External links               [ edit ]   History   The territory was in  Roman  times part of the province of  Germania Superior . The towns of Worms and Alzey go both back to Roman  military camps . In medieval times the region was part of the  Palatine . After the  French occupation  (1797-1814) it was incorporated into the  Grand Duchy of Hesse  and formed a part of its province  Rhenish Hesse .   Two districts named Alzey and Worms were established in 1835. In the reorganisation of the districts of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1969 the new district of Alzey-Worms was formed by merging parts of the former districts.     [ edit ]   Geography   The district is named after the city of Worms (which is neighboring, but not belonging to the district) and the city of  Alzey  (which is the capital of the district). The  Rhine  forms the eastern border. From there the land gently rises to the  Alzey Uplands  ( Alzeyer Hgelland ) in the west, which is the northernmost extension of the  Palatinate forest . The westernmost portion of the district is crossed by several brooks and covered with forests; it is called the  Rheinhessische Schweiz  ( Rhine-Hessian Switzerland ).     [ edit ]   Coat of arms         The coat of arms displays a dragon and the fiddle. The  dragon  is the heraldic symbol of the city of  Worms , while the fiddle stands for  Alzey . Both themes occur in the  Nibelungenlied , the old German epos playing in the region. The hero  Siegfried  killed  Fafnir  the dragon and gained wisdom from drinking its blood. The fiddle belongs to Volker the minstrel, another character of the Nibelungenlied, who allegedly had lived in Alzey.

When incorporated as a town in 1816, it named itself after  Samuel Dexter , who was then running for  governor of Massachusetts  (which Maine was a territory of). The town of  Brooks ,  Maine  in nearby  Waldo County , was incorporated the same year and named for the opposing candidate,  John Brooks . Brooks won the election. The town of Dexter, however, achieved the greater prosperity.   The town grew because of its location on the East Branch of the Sebasticook River, which provided excellent  water power  for mills. In 1818, Jonathan Farrar constructed a grist mill at the falls. The  Dexter Historical Society  today uses the building which replaced it in 1854 as part of its museum complex. The stream would also power 5 woolen mills, the oldest and largest of which was established by Amos and Jeremiah Abbott in 1836.  Amos Abbott & Company  , which closed in 1975, was the only textile mill in the  United States  to be owned by one family for such a long period.   Dexter's downtown is dominated by the  Memorial Building , designed by John Morrison. At its top is the community's largest clock, named ""Nancy"" after the architect's wife. The tallest building in town is the  Unitarian Universalist  Church. It is also Dexter's oldest house of worship, built in 1826, but given a new steeple and vestibule by  Boston  architect  Thomas W. Silloway  in 1869. Five buildings in Dexter are listed on the  National Register of Historic Places , including the  Grist Mill ;  Universalist Church ;  The Abbott Memorial Library  by  Boston  architect J. William Beal;  The Bank Block  by  Bangor  architect George W. Orff; and  Zion's Hill , the  Ralph Owen Brewster  House by  Portland  architectural firm  Stevens and Stevens .   In 1848 the town was visited by a  tornado  which tore large trees out by their roots and destroyed even the strongest buildings.

Dexter is drained by the  East Branch  of the  Sebasticook River , which flows from  Lake Wassookeag .   Dexter is half-way (almost exactly) between  Bangor  and  Waterville .

When incorporated as a town in 1816, it named itself after  Samuel Dexter , who was then running for  governor of Massachusetts  (which Maine was a territory of). The town of  Brooks ,  Maine  in nearby  Waldo County , was incorporated the same year and named for the opposing candidate,  John Brooks . Brooks won the election. The town of Dexter, however, achieved the greater prosperity.   The town grew because of its location on the East Branch of the Sebasticook River, which provided excellent  water power  for mills. In 1818, Jonathan Farrar constructed a grist mill at the falls. The  Dexter Historical Society  today uses the building which replaced it in 1854 as part of its museum complex. The stream would also power 5 woolen mills, the oldest and largest of which was established by Amos and Jeremiah Abbott in 1836.  Amos Abbott & Company  , which closed in 1975, was the only textile mill in the  United States  to be owned by one family for such a long period.   Dexter's downtown is dominated by the  Memorial Building , designed by John Morrison. At its top is the community's largest clock, named ""Nancy"" after the architect's wife. The tallest building in town is the  Unitarian Universalist  Church. It is also Dexter's oldest house of worship, built in 1826, but given a new steeple and vestibule by  Boston  architect  Thomas W. Silloway  in 1869. Five buildings in Dexter are listed on the  National Register of Historic Places , including the  Grist Mill ;  Universalist Church ;  The Abbott Memorial Library  by  Boston  architect J. William Beal;  The Bank Block  by  Bangor  architect George W. Orff; and  Zion's Hill , the  Ralph Owen Brewster  House by  Portland  architectural firm  Stevens and Stevens .   In 1848 the town was visited by a  tornado  which tore large trees out by their roots and destroyed even the strongest buildings.

The  Town of Milan  is in the northern part of the county.           Contents       1   History   2   Geography   3   Demographics   4   Communities and locations in Milan   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   History   The area that comprises Milan today was the western part of the  Little Nine Partners Patent  of 1706. The area was first settled around 1760 when Johannes Rowe, the son of a  Palatine  immigrant, bought 911 acres (3.69 km 2 ) from  Robert Livingston . He built a stone house around 1766 which remained just under 200 years and is now gone (see photo to right and external links).          1766 Johannes Rowe House, photographed 1940, now gone. Formerly on Rowe Road       Milan was established from part of the  Town of North East  on March 6 (sometimes shown as March 10) 1818. The session laws stated that the first town meeting would be held the first Tuesday of April and was at the home of Stephen Thorne who was elected  Town Supervisor  along with John F. Bartlett,  Town Clerk .   Milan was largely a farming and mill town giving birth to its name today [ citation needed ] . Known by many as the ""Mill Lands"" for its rolling farmland and numerous gristmills. The main thoroughfare for the community ran from the  Hudson River  to  Salisbury, CT . and travelers referred to the road as the "" turnpike "" it later became recognized as the Salisbury Turnpike and sections of the road still exist today and bear that name.   The early population peaked in 1840 at 1,745 residents and went into decline until 1930 with only 622 residents. It was the influence of the railroad and the move to river cities and the west that caused the decline. Also, Milan's soil was hilly and rocky and tough to farm. During the  Great Depression , these poor farming conditions led to instances of starvation and disease in the town. The town was quarantined for six months in 1934 due to an outbreak of  smallpox , which was exacerbated by the difficulty of a small community in obtaining the  vaccine  during this period. Then following the 1930s the population grew again, due in part to the construction of the  Taconic Parkway  which ended in Milan at the time, and then the post  World War II  boom. The 1840 population level was reached again in 1980, some 140 years later.   From the 1980s to the turn of the new century population has had moderate growth.

Lafayetteville 1918         [ edit ]   Geography   According to the  United States Census Bureau , the town has a total area of 36.3 square miles (94.0 km), of which, 36.1 square miles (93.5 km) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.5 km) of it (0.52%) is water.   The north town line is the border of  Columbia County ,  New York .   The  Taconic State Parkway  passes along the eastern part of the town.     [ edit ]   Demographics   The 2000 Census was corrected due to an error in the total population count of Milan. Corrected population counts result from a process called the Count Question Resolution Program. Milan's total population in 2000 was 2,356, not 4,559 as originally reported. Due to the original error in total population, The US Census Bureau corrected four categories; Total Population, Total Housing Units, Vacant Housing Units and Group Quarters Population. They failed to correct any other data rendering the 2000 Census useless for demographic study. The resulting demographic data cited below is from the 2000 Census with almost all of it being incorrect.   As of the  census [ 1 ]  of 2000, there were 4,559 people, 882 households, and 612 families residing in the town. The  population density  was 126.3 people per square mile (48.8/km). There were 1,090 housing units at an average density of 30.2/sq mi (11.7/km). The racial makeup of the town was 60.63%  White , 27.22%  African American , 0.66%  Native American , 0.75%  Asian , 0.04%  Pacific Islander , 9.87% from  other races , and 0.83% from two or more races.  Hispanic  or  Latino  of any race were 15.68% of the population.   There were 882 households out of which 35.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.5% were  married couples  living together, 6.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.6% were non-families. 23.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.62 and the average family size was 3.14.   In the town the population was spread out with 14.2% under the age of 18, 7.7% from 18 to 24, 49.8% from 25 to 44, 21.7% from 45 to 64, and 6.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 299.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 364.2 males.   The median income for a household in the town was $54,491, and the median income for a family was $65,250. Males had a median income of $26,473 versus $27,500 for females. The  per capita income  for the town was $19,002. About 2.8% of families and 4.6% of the population were below the  poverty line , including 4.6% of those under age 18 and 6.3% of those age 65 or over.

[ edit ]   History   The Town of Archie was founded in 1880, being platted in July of that year, the town owes its existence to the railroad that was being constructed through the middle of Cass County. The Archie Town Company and R.T. Railey, the agent for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, sold lots through their trustee, William H. Barrett. The railroad superintendent, H.C. Talmage, named the depot and town for his youngest son, Archie Talmage.   The railroad reached the new town in August 1880, and the town boomed with new construction and new businesses. H. T. Carr had the first store open and was the  postmaster . In August there was a grocery store, drug store, lumber yard and 2 saloons. The lumber yard sold a large quantity of lumber for, by September, a restaurant, livery stable, drug store, harness shop, grain elevator blacksmith shop 2 dry goods stores and 2 grocery stores.   Two towns, Austin and Everett, had previously served the farming community of the south central Cass County. A few of the merchants and townsmen of these two towns moved to Archie, but Austin maintained a viable economy for a number of years.   The population of the town grew amid a boom in the mid 1880s but by the 1890 census had fallen to 278 and remained in that range for decades. The population in the1960 census shows moderate growth to 348. Steady growth since that time has led to the population of 799.   The early Postmasters combined their government jobs with ownership of a store where the post office was located. The post office moved about depending on which merchant was awarded the political plum.   The churches of Archie have played an important role in the history of the community. Four Churches have a long histories in the town.   Archie began as a trade point, connecting by means of the railroad, the outside world with the local farmers in south Cass County. The town did not grow substantially beyond this initial purpose. In the early 1800s two businesses existed in town that gave some hope for more substantial growth: a steam powered flour mill and a coal mine. The town did see economic and demographic growth in the mid 1880s, but the two businesses ceased to exist later in the decade and the boom died.   There have been very few manufacturing businesses in Archie that could have led to more complex and viable economy. As transportation technology allowed easier travel, the number and profitability of local businesses declined, and the town became a bedroom community. As the business community declined in importance, the school had become the focus of the community.     [ edit ]   Education   Archie is home to Archie High School. The school mascot is the Whirlwinds. The school website is available here.  [1]     [ edit ]   References     ^  a   b   ""American FactFinder"" .

The population of the town grew amid a boom in the mid 1880s but by the 1890 census had fallen to 278 and remained in that range for decades. The population in the1960 census shows moderate growth to 348. Steady growth since that time has led to the population of 799.   The early Postmasters combined their government jobs with ownership of a store where the post office was located. The post office moved about depending on which merchant was awarded the political plum.   The churches of Archie have played an important role in the history of the community. Four Churches have a long histories in the town.   Archie began as a trade point, connecting by means of the railroad, the outside world with the local farmers in south Cass County. The town did not grow substantially beyond this initial purpose. In the early 1800s two businesses existed in town that gave some hope for more substantial growth: a steam powered flour mill and a coal mine. The town did see economic and demographic growth in the mid 1880s, but the two businesses ceased to exist later in the decade and the boom died.   There have been very few manufacturing businesses in Archie that could have led to more complex and viable economy. As transportation technology allowed easier travel, the number and profitability of local businesses declined, and the town became a bedroom community. As the business community declined in importance, the school had become the focus of the community.     [ edit ]   Education   Archie is home to Archie High School. The school mascot is the Whirlwinds. The school website is available here.  [1]     [ edit ]   References     ^  a   b   ""American FactFinder"" .

It incorporated on  2003 - 09-03 [ 1 ]   It received national attention in July 2007 when evangelist  Tammy Faye  died at her home there.   The Kansas City Star describes it as ""an upscale, gated community"" when it reported that police had shot a 7 1/2 foot, 118 pound alligator there in July 2005. [ 2 ]   The village is built around a 110-acre (0.4 km 2 ) reservoir on Mill Creek (a tributary of the  Blue River (Missouri) ) and an 18-hole golf course built in 1990 designed by  Donald Sechrest . It derives its name from the reservoir and real estate developer Harry Lloyd who started out selling trinkets and seasonal gifts in the area via the House of Lloyd brand but branched into the real estate business. [ 3 ]   When it incorporated it had a population of 136. The United States census reported it had a population of 368 and 175 housing units in its Geographically Updated Population Certification Program (GUPCP) Counts Released to Government Units in September 2005. [ 4 ]  When the village filed the paperwork to incorporate they said they wanted to incorporate as an independent village rather than being annexed by Kansas City or Belton. [ 5 ]   The Zip Code of 64012 is shared with  Belton, Missouri .

A fortified ranger post was established near the springs in 1811. On an 1835 map of Indiana, the community was known as Salt Spring. The town was founded in 1857.   The  sulfur  springs were commercially exploited for medical benefits starting in 1840. By the later half of the 19th century, French Lick was famous in the United States as a  spa town . In the early 20th century it also featured  casinos  attracting celebrities like boxer  Joe Louis , composer  Irving Berlin  and gangster  Al Capone .   In 1943, the  Chicago Cubs  held  Spring Training  camp in French Lick. In order to conserve rail transport during  World War II , the 1943  Spring Training  was limited to an area east of the  Mississippi River  and north of the  Ohio River .  [ 3 ]   The  French Lick Resort Casino  was the focal point of most of the entertainment; the hotel remained open well after the casinos were closed down and the heyday of the town was well past. The resort closed for renovation in 2005.   Pluto Water , a best selling  laxative  of the first half of the 20th century, was bottled here. It was also home to a large  7-Up  bottling facility, which ceased operation in the mid-20th century.   Franklin D. Roosevelt  announced his intention to run for president at a National Governors' Convention held at the French Lick Springs Hotel.   Ever since his professional basketball career took off, the town has been best known for being the hometown of  NBA  great  Larry Bird . French Lick is also the  hometown  of former  Sacramento Kings   head coach   Jerry Reynolds , who currently works as the team's  color commentator  on its television broadcasts and is the Kings' director of player personnel.

Overcrowding, a serious problem in recent years, has hastened plans build a new high school, though those problems may continue even after the new high school opens. In 1996, Rogers High School was ranked by Newsweek number 771 among the top 1000 high schools in America based on the number of students taking AP Tests.       Rogers Heritage High School  (War Eagles) is the new high school that opened in August 2008 for the 2008-09 school year. The school colors are navy blue and orange. Karen Steen has been selected to be the first principal of Rogers Heritage. [ 4 ]       [ edit ]   Airports   Carter Field, Rogers' municipal airport, is home to Wal-Mart's air fleet.

Contents       1   History   2   Geography   3   Demographics   4   Trivia   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   History   French Lick was originally a  French   trading post . A fortified ranger post was established near the springs in 1811. On an 1835 map of Indiana, the community was known as Salt Spring. The town was founded in 1857.   The  sulfur  springs were commercially exploited for medical benefits starting in 1840. By the later half of the 19th century, French Lick was famous in the United States as a  spa town . In the early 20th century it also featured  casinos  attracting celebrities like boxer  Joe Louis , composer  Irving Berlin  and gangster  Al Capone .   In 1943, the  Chicago Cubs  held  Spring Training  camp in French Lick. In order to conserve rail transport during  World War II , the 1943  Spring Training  was limited to an area east of the  Mississippi River  and north of the  Ohio River .  [ 3 ]   The  French Lick Resort Casino  was the focal point of most of the entertainment; the hotel remained open well after the casinos were closed down and the heyday of the town was well past. The resort closed for renovation in 2005.   Pluto Water , a best selling  laxative  of the first half of the 20th century, was bottled here. It was also home to a large  7-Up  bottling facility, which ceased operation in the mid-20th century.   Franklin D. Roosevelt  announced his intention to run for president at a National Governors' Convention held at the French Lick Springs Hotel.   Ever since his professional basketball career took off, the town has been best known for being the hometown of  NBA  great  Larry Bird . French Lick is also the  hometown  of former  Sacramento Kings   head coach   Jerry Reynolds , who currently works as the team's  color commentator  on its television broadcasts and is the Kings' director of player personnel.

According to 2005 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the city was 30,506, ranking it as the state's 12th largest city, behind  Bentonville . [ 1 ]  It is part of the  Little Rock  North Little Rock  Conway   Metropolitan Statistical Area . Jacksonville currently has a population of about 31,190 according to the 2007 US Census.   The city is named for Nicholas and Elizabeth Jackson, landowners who deeded the land for the railroad right-of-way to the Cairo & Fulton Railroad in 1870. The community evolved from the settlement surrounding the railroad depot, eventually incorporating in 1941. In 1941, construction began on the Arkansas Ordinance Plant (AOP), which served as the primary facility for the development of fuses and denonators for World War II. [ 2 ]  Following the war, AOP ceased operations and the land was sold for commercial interests, including the development of the  Little Rock Air Force Base  in 1955. Today, portions of AOP still remain including the  Arkansas Ordinance Plant Guard House  which is on the  National Register of Historic Places  and the  Jacksonville Museum of Military History .

[ edit ]   Education   Since 1927, Jacksonville has been part of the  Pulaski County Special School District , one of the largest school districts in Arkansas. The bulk of the city is contained in the district's Zone 6, with local campuses including the main high school,  Jacksonville High School , hosting grades 9-12; two middle schools; and several elementary schools. The two middle schools  [1]  in central Jacksonville are unique in the state of Arkansas, having been segregated into single-gender schools, although certain extracurricular activities continue to be shared by students at both middle schools. The outlying areas surrounding Jacksonville, along with  Little Rock Air Force Base , are served by  North Pulaski High School , located in northwestern Jacksonville. Additional elementary, middle, and junior high school campuses in and near western Jacksonville serve the same area (the district's Zone 5), with one elementary campus  Arnold Drive Elementary  exclusively serving the Air Force base. Homer Adkins Elementary, on Jacksonville's southern edge, is in Zone 7 of the district.   In September 2008, Jacksonville decided to split from the  Pulaski County Special School District  and the measure was approved by the board of the PCSSD.  [ 5 ]   A number of privately-operated daycare services and church-affiliated schools are also available throughout the city. In addition,  Arkansas State University Beebe  maintains a degree center at Little Rock Air Force Base for post-secondary education.

[ 1 ] . According to 2007 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the city was 11,657. [ 2 ]  Camden is the principal city of the Camden  Micropolitan Statistical Area , which includes all of Ouachita and  Calhoun  counties.  R&B  singer  Ne-Yo  was born in Camden.           Contents       1   History   2   Geography   3   Demographics   4   References   5   See also   6   External links               [ edit ]   History   In 1783, a French trader named Fabre settled on a bluff above the Ouachita River and called the settlement Ecore Fabre (Fabers Bluff or the Hill of Faber). This would mark the permanent settlement of what would become Camden. The city of Camden marks its founding as 1824, but it was not incorporated and officially named Camden until 1844. Some controversy exists over the origin of the name but most agree it is named for  Camden, Alabama , the hometown of General  Thomas Woodward , an early city founder. Prior to the name change from Ecore Fabre to Camden, the location was simply known as ""The Bluff"".   In the American Civil War, Camden was occupied for several months in 1864 by Union soldiers as a part of the Union army's ill fated Red River Campaign. During this epidode the Confederate victory in the Battle of Poison Springs occurred west of the city on April l8, 1864.   For several decades, Camden was the headquarters of the  Clyde E. Palmer   newspaper  chain, which included the  Camden News , the  Texarkana Gazette , the  Hot Springs Sentinel-Record , and the  Magnolia Banner News . Later the company shifted to  Little Rock , when it acquired the  Arkansas Democrat  and later merged it with acquired assets from the  Arkansas Gazette  to establish the  Arkansas Democrat-Gazette .   Palmer's son-in-law,  Walter E. Hussman, Sr.  (19061988), and Palmer's grandson,  Walter E. Hussman, Jr.  (born 1947), were threafter publishers of the  Camden News  and chief executive officers of the Palmer properties. Hussman, Jr., is the publisher of the  Arkansas Democrat-Gazette  in Little Rock, home of the Palmer-Hussman management.   In pre-Civil War days Camden was a bustling river port and mercantile center at the headwaters of the Ouachita River, and the town remained an important cotton shipping depot through the early decades of the twentieth century. Before the steamboat era faded, Camden had become a railroad town--served by the mainline of the St. Louis Southwestern (Cotton Belt) and by branch lines of the Missouri Pacific and the Rock Island. A major economic infusion accompanied the South Arkansas oil boom of the 1920's and a new International Paper Co. mill in 1927. Near the end of World War II thousands of new jobs were created with the 1944 construction of a Naval Ammunition Depot across the Ouachita at Shumaker--and a resurgence of that activity during the Korean War. An economic downturn following the post Korean War closure of that plant was addressed by redeveloping its facilities and grounds into an extensive industrial area which, in time, came to host some major defense establishments and multiple smaller industries. A technical campus of Southern Arkansas University also located there. In the 1990's, post Cold-War downsizing of the defense industry brought severe job losses--and resulting population decline--to the Camden area as did the closure of the International Paper Co. mill a few years later. But in recent years a partial resurgence of defense contracts and a diversified mixture of small business and professional activity have stablized the town's economy at a level below the peak levels of the boom years. As one of Arkansas'most historic towns, the city attracts considerable heritage tourism.     Camden was the home of the Grapette and Orangette soft drinks with flavors developed by B.T. Fooks. (In 2005, Sam's Choice Grapette and Sam's Choice Orangette again became available in Wal-Mart stores nationwide.)
