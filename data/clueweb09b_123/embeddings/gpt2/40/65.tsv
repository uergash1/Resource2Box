The Bluebird is 6 to 7 inches long and is a member of the Thrush family. Male Bluebirds are a pale sky blue over most of their body, darker on their back. Females are blue-grey with blue wings and tail, duller than the male. Juvenile birds have blue wings with the tail area duller than the adult male, a white eye ring and spotted underparts. Mountain Bluebirds live in open grasslands and nest in holes in trees, crevices and nesting boxes. They have a zig-zagging flight pattern that easily identifies them.                                   State Dance     The 1989 legislature designated the  square dance  as the American Folk Dance of Idaho. Two of the most commonly cited ancestors to modern square dance are the English Morris dance and the French Quadrille. It is the Quadrille that most point to as the grand-daddy of our modern square dance. One of the earliest records of this type of dance in America is contained in the works of John Playford, a musician and dancing master. His book, 'The English Dancing Master - Plaine and Easy Rules for the Dancing of Country Dances, with Tunes to Each Dance' was published in seventeen editions between 1650 and 1728 and contained 918 dances. As the pioneers moved westward, many of the dances were lost or forgotten, but many were preserved, particularly in the southern Appalachians where the running set established itself as one of the deep taproots of western square dance. The running set even had a caller -- America's only unique contribution to the square dance.                                Photo courtesy of:    Tom Davenport, Layton UT       State Fish    The  Cutthroat Trout  was designated the state fish by the 1990 legislature. The Cutthroat, along with the Rainbow and Bull Trout, is native to Idaho. The body color varies with the back ranging from steel gray to olive green. The sides may be yellow brown with red or pink along the belly. The Cutthroat name comes from the distinctive red to orange slash on the underside of its lower jaw. The scientific name for Cutthroat Trout,  Oncorhynchus clarki , is in reference to William Clark who first described in detail the Cutthroats of the Columbia River. His partner Meriwether Lewis earlier encountered Cutthroats near the great falls of Montana's Missouri River in July of 1805. Cutthroat species found in Idaho are the Westslope Cutthroat which is found in northern and central Idaho and the Yellowstone Cutthroat which is found in southeastern Idaho.                                  State Flag     A silk flag, with a blue field, 5 feet 6 inches fly, 4 feet 4 inches on pike is bordered by gilt fringe 2 inches wide, with the Great Seal of Idaho in the center. The words 'State of Idaho' are embroidered in gold block letters two inches high on a red band below the Great Seal. Adopted by the 1907 legislature.                                   State Flower     The  Syringa  ( Philadelphus lewisii ) was designated the state flower of Idaho by the legislature in 1931. The species name ' lewisii ' honors Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis & Clark expedition. Lewis wrote of the plant in his journal. It is a branching shrub growing 3 to 10 feet tall, with clusters of white, fragrant flowers. The blossoms are similar to the mock orange. It grows in open coniferous forests, at forest edge and in moist draws in drier regions providing good coverage for wildlife. Native Americans used its branches for bows, arrows and cradles.                                Photo courtesy of:    Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument       State Fossil    The 1988 legislature designated the Hagerman Horse Fossil as the official    state fossil. Discovered in 1928, it was originally described as Plesippus    shoshonensis. Subsequent research found the Hagerman horse to be the same    as a previously described species and it is now known as Equus simplicidens.    The Hagerman horse is the oldest known representative of the modern horse    genus Equus (includes horses, donkeys, and zebras) and is believed to be more    closely related to the living Grevy's zebra in Africa. The 3.5 million year    old sediments at the  Hagerman Fossil    Beds National Monument  contain the world's    richest known fossil deposits from the late Pliocene epoch. They have yielded    about 200 horse skeletons, 20 of which are complete. The more than 200 vertebrate,    invertebrate, and plant species preserved there represent the last vestiges    of animals that existed prior to the Ice Age and the earliest appearances    of modern flora and fauna.                                Photo courtesy of:    Danny L. Barney, Ph.D., University of Idaho       State Fruit    Several  huckleberry  species are native to Idaho, all belonging to genus  Vaccinium  section  Myrtillus . The most common and popular is the black or thin-leaved huckleberry ( Vaccinium membranaceum ). Plants grow slowly, taking up to 15 years to reach full maturity. Black huckleberries produce single plump, dark purple berries in the axils of leaves on new shoots. They depend on an insulating cover of snow for survival during winter and have not been successfully grown commercially. Black huckleberries grow at elevations between 2,000 and 11,000 feet with many productive colonies between 4,000 and 6,000 feet. Black huckleberries usually grow from 1 to 6 feet tall and produce berries up to 1/2 inch in diameter. Huckleberries are a favorite food of bears.                                 Photo courtesy of:    Stewart's Gem Shop, Boise       State Gem     Adopted by the 1967 legislature, the  Idaho Star Garnet  is known worldwide by collectors. Garnets are complex silicates, related to Quartz, and found almost exclusively in Idaho in Latah and Benewah counties. Star Garnets are a natural stone, not synthetically produced. Star Garnets are more rare than either Star Rubies or Star Sapphires. Normally the star in the Idaho Garnet has four rays, but occasionally one has six rays as in a Sapphire. The color is usually dark purple or plum and the star seems to glide or float across the dark surface. The star is caused by intrusions of the mineral rutile.                                Photo courtesy of:    Don Shugart & The Appaloosa Horse Club       State Horse     Historians believe the Nez Perce and Palouse tribes of Washington, Oregon and Idaho were the first tribes to breed horses for specific traits - intelligence, speed and endurance. White settlers call these horses 'Palouse horses.' Over time they came to be referred to as 'a Palousey' and the 'Appalousey.' During the Nez Perce War of 1877,  Appaloosa  horses helped the non-treaty Nez Perce, under the guidance of Chief Joseph, elude the U.S. Calvary for several months. The coloring of the Appaloosa coat is distinct in every individual horse and ranges from white blanketed hips to a full leopard. Adopted by the 1975 legislature.                                 Photo courtesy of:    Faye Sutherland, Boise       State Insect     The  Monarch Butterfly  ( Danaus plexippus ) was adopted as the state insect by the state legislature in 1992. Early settlers to North America from Europe, particularily those from Holland and England, named the butterfly 'Monarch,' after King William, Prince of Orange, stateholder of Holland and later named King of England. The monarchs' color suggested the name. The Monarch Butterfly is a great migrator, traveling many miles during its lifetime, which can be from a few weeks up to a year. Monarchs range in mass from .25 to .75 grams (a dime has a mass of 2.3 grams). Males are usually larger than females. Female Monarchs lay eggs on the underside of milkweed plants. The larvae then feed on the plants. Monarchs go through a complete metamorphosis in 3 to 6 weeks.                                            Photo courtesy of: The Peregrine Fund        Peregrine description excerpted            from The Peregrine Fund web site with permission.          State Raptor         The  Peregrine Falcon  ( Falco peregrinus ) was        adopted as the state raptor for Idaho by the legislature in 2004. The        scientific name comes from the Latin words falco, meaning hook-shaped        (falcate) and may refer to the beak or claws, and peregrinus, meaning        to wander. Peregrines have also been called Duck Hawk, Great-footed Hawk,        and Wandering Falcon. The Peregrine Falcon has a body length of 15 - 20        inches, a 3 1/2 foot wingspan, and weighs 1 1/4 - 2 3/4 pounds. The Peregrine        Falcon has one of the most global distributions of any bird of prey. This        falcon is found on every continent except Antarctica, and lives in a wide        variety of habitats from tropics, deserts, and maritime to the tundra,        and from sea level to 12,000 feet. Peregrines are highly migratory in        the northern part of their range.         Boise is home to the World Center for          Birds of Prey, The Peregrine Fund's world headquarters. Visit them on         the web at  www.peregrinefund.org  or         visit in person at the  Velma       Morrison Interpretive Center .                               State Seal     The Great Seal of the State, replica of which is embroidered in colors in the center of the flag, came into existence in 1891 by act of the first state legislature. The seal was designed by Emma Edwards Green, the only woman to design a state seal. The translation of the Latin motto on the seal, 'Esto Perpetua' is 'Let it be perpetual' or 'It is forever.' In 1957 the seal was updated and streamlined by Paul B. Evans. The official Great Seal can be seen in the office of the Secretary of State.                                 Photo courtesy of:    Idaho Forest Products Commission       State Tree     The  Western White Pine  ( Pinus Monticola pinaceae ), our state tree, is probably most notable since the largest remaining volume of this timber in the United States grows in the northern part of Idaho. White Pine has many fine qualities such as straight grain and soft even texture. Idaho’s state tree grows to 175 feet with a trunk diameter from 5 to 8 feet. The largest western white pine in the world stands 219 ft. high near Elk River, Idaho. Adopted by the 1935 legislature. According to the legislative bill, it was promoted by 'members of Ellen Wright Camp, Franklin County Chapter, Daughters of Pioneers.'                               Photo / description courtesy of:    Idaho Potato Commission       State Vegetable    Idaho's unique environment provides nearly perfect growing conditions for  potato es. The soil, water, clean air and climate in Idaho contribute to those consistently high-quality potatoes that have made Idaho famous for so many years. Idaho's rich volcanic soil is ideally suited for potatoes. Warm, sunny days, cool nights and water from melting snow in nearby mountains make the perfect combination for growing the world's best potatoes.

They are found only in the New World. People across North America attract them to their homes through hummingbird feeders and flowering gardens, and can be rewarded with bright migratory species, such as a male  Rufous Hummingbird  (left). Yet the true center of trochilid diversity is in the Neotropics, home to a dazzling array of species that range from tiny to surprisingly large, and with an assortment of head plumes, tail streamers, and bill shapes. Their ability to hover and fly backwards makes them unique. Further, their interdependence on and co-evolution with flowers provide a fascinating correlation and field for study. Because the sources of nectar are constantly changing as flowers bloom and fade, most hummingbirds live solitary lives, aggressively defending nectar sources from rivals. Despite the strong pressure to gather nectar rapidly, studies have shown that 70% of a hummer's time is spent doing little else than singing, self-preening, and sunbathing (Schuchmann 1999). In the two shots below, a male  White-necked Jacobin  sits near its favored feeder in Trinidad (below left) but immediately reacts when a White-chested Emerald tries to approach. Such interactions can lead to dramatic interspecific aerial chases.                                                                                                                    A male  Magnificent Hummingbird  sitting in the shade (below left) can look dark and dingy. But when the hummer sits in the sun, and turns its head (below right), the observer is suddenly dazzled by a flash of spectacular glittering color. This species ranges from the southwest United States to Panama, and is a big hit at feeders from Ramsey Canyon, Arizona, to Savegre, Costa Rica.                                                                                                                                                    Iridescent color among birds is one of nature's wonders, and hummingbirds display a full spectrum. For many species, iridescence is limited to a throat gorget, or a gorget and crown. North American examples include  Anna's Hummingbird , the resident species throughout much of California (below, top row left) and  Costa's Hummingbird  of the southwestern deserts (below, top row right). On others the entire body is jeweled with waves of color, like on  Violet Sabrewing  (bottom row, below).                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Neotropics are inhabited by a host of hummingbirds. Colorful species buzz about rainforest trees and visit flowers at timberline on Andean volcanoes. The Caribbean islands have their own fine assortment, including  Purple-throated Carib  (right), this one on Dominica. In my meanderings around the Neotropics, there have been many wonderful species, such as the Horned Sungem  Heliactin cornuta  recently seen in southern Brazil. Three species have particularly impressed me with their unbelievable beauty, and all have been in the western Andes of Colombia or northwestern Ecuador. I have photos of none of these, but nothing can beat a Velvet-purple Coronet  Boissonneaua jardini , or a Purple-backed Thornbill  Ramphomicron microrhynchum , or a Rainbow-bearded Thornbill  Chalcostigma herrani . Try to see one if you have the chance. The names of hummingbirds alone set one's head spinning: sunangels, comets, pufflegs, fairies, starfrontlets, brilliants, mountain-gems, coquettes ....                            Unusual beaks and strange tails are part of the world of tropical hummingbirds. The bill of  White-tipped Sicklebill  (below left) is adapted best for  Heliconia  flowers. By far the longest bill, proportionate to size, belongs to the ridiculously unbalanced  Sword-billed Hummingbird  (below right) of the high Andes. It is adapted for feeding on exceptionally long tubular flowers; this photo was taken at about 9000' in Peru by my friend Bob Tintle while we were birding together. The yellow on its throat is pollen.                                                                                                                                                                                           Hummingbirds range in size from the smallest birds on earth to several quite large species in the Andes. Between them, these hummers range in size from 2 to 8.5 inches, and in weight from 1.6 to 19 grams. Among the largest is  Great Sapphirewing  (left), shown here from the Peruvian Andes, and nearby lives the largest of them all,  Giant Hummingbird  Patagona gigas , the size of a swift.                 Among the smallest species are the woodstars and the coquettes. The two photos below show two Neotropical coquettes: a female  Tufted Coquette  (below left), taken in Trinidad, and a male  Black-crested Coquette  (below right), from Costa Rica.                                                                                                                                                                          Despite the many species of hummingbirds, they are divided into just two subfamilies (Schuchmann 1999). The Trochilinae include all the colorful species (nearly 300 in all) while the Phaethornithinae is composed of the six genera and 34 species of hermits. Brown, long-tailed hermits forage in the understory; some short-tailed species weigh only 1.6 gram (the same weight as the tiny Bee Hummingbird  Mellisuga helenae  of Cuba, often termed the ""world's smallest bird"").              All hermits that have been studied display in noisy leks, their clicking dominating a patch of jungle. Hermits often have a species affinity for  Heliconia  plants and it can be rewarding to ""stake-out"" a patch inside the forest. This  Rufous-breasted  (or Hairy)  Hermit  (right) was sitting right next to 'his'  Heliconia . Unlike many other hummingbirds, hermits are generally not territorial and few species have iridescence. When present, it is limited to the throat or crown. Nonetheless, it is obvious that hermits are hummingbirds, and even the most jaded ""I can't tell one bird from another"" non-naturalist can identify a hummingbird as such.                                                                                                                                                   Of course, not all hummingbirds are tropical, or appear to defy the laws of proportions, nor are all bright and colorful. Females and youngsters are often plainly-colored, particularly among the migratory species of North America This cryptic coloring can be important because only females sit on the nest, and if they were bright then they or the nestlings might more easily become prey. Hummingbird nests are often beautifully spun, like those of my local  Anna's Hummingbird  (above left) or the lichen-covered nest with almost-ready-to-fledge juvenal  Costa's Hummingbirds  (above right; it actual represents the first documented nesting in Monterey County, California).             Schuchmann (1999) summarizes hummingbird breeding biology this way: ""Male hummingbirds are polygamous, mating with several females during a reproductive period. In most species studied the male associates with the female only during a short period to fertilize her eggs. All remaining reproductive responsibilities like nest building, incubation, and rearing the young are carried out solely by the female."" He goes on to cite a few reports of males participating in incubation or rearing the young, particularly in some tropical species, but generally concludes that there is insufficient evidence to confirm any parental care by males. What then am I to make of this photo I took in Costa Rica? It appears to show a male  Blue-throated Goldentail  incubating a nest. The hummer is certainly this species and seems to be in male plumage with a glittering deep-blue throat. This is a lekking species, so why would a male be incubating? May females occasionally attain a male-like plumage? There are many mysteries here.                                                      Many North American hummingbirds are migratory, including Rufous Hummingbird shown at the top of this family account. Migratory hummers are susceptible to vagrancy, accounting for the variety of species that have reached California, including several  Violet-crowned Hummingbirds , one of which is shown at right (in Sonoma County; a first record for northern California). Surely the most unexpected was Xantus's Hummingbird  Hylocharis xantusii  from southern Baja California; a male visited interior San Diego Co. but a female built a nest and laid eggs in Ventura Co. (Hainebach 1992). The only Blue-throated Hummingbird  Lampornis clemenciae  to reach California – in Tulare Co. from Dec 1977-May 1978 – not only built a nest and laid eggs, but fledged three young! These appeared to be Blue-throated X Anna's hybrids (Baldridge et al. 1983).             The field identification of female North American hummingbirds is one of our most difficult problems. Stiles (1971, 1972), Baltosser (1987), Jones (1992), Heidcamp (1997), Howell (2002), and Williamson (2002) are all useful sources.                                       Many hummingbirds are endemics, limited to single  Caribbean islands, or isolated mountain chains, or, in the case of  Mangrove Hummingbird  (left, in full song and display), the mangrove swamps on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica.              Some of these are threatened with extinction: 29 species are listed as endangered or vulnerable by Birdlife International, including Mangrove Hummingbird.              Surely the most sought-after of them all – rare, endangered, spectacular, and limited to a very small range in northern Peru – is  Marvelous Spatuletail , shown below in a wonderful shot by James Hecht. A separate page focused on this prized species, with more photos, is  elsewhere on this web site .                                                                                                                From  Green Violetear  (left), widespread from Mexico to Bolivia, to  Bearded Mountaineer  (right), endemic to the high Andes of central Peru, hummingbirds are fascinating. I could go on and on about them. They are reason enough alone to be a birdwatcher.

Bibliographic note : Although hummingbirds have inspired hundreds of books, there is no single family book. Such a work would be a difficult undertaking, since hummingbirds are the second largest family in the New World (after flycatchers) with over 330 species. Between 1849 and 1861, John Gould published a five volume  Hummingbirds  series totaling 418 lithographed plates capturing the beauty and aerial artistry of many South American hummers (now reprinted as Gould 1990). For many years, this was the major work on the family until Crawford Greenewalt (1960) published a spectacular set of color ""stop-action"" photographs of South American hummingbirds (Greenewalt's pioneering volume is now rare and expensive). Numerous other such books followed using strobe-flash technology to capture hummers in mid-flight, including Scheithauer (1966) and Dunning (1970) who included incredible Andean species, or Keppelman (1988) on southeast Arizona. I have found that by far the most useful for detailed identification purposes for North American species is Tyrell & Tyrell (1985), not because of the text (which is very general) but because the excellent photo quality is often sufficient to determine points like wing formula and remige or rectrix shape.                While not considered a ""family book"" per se, the Schuchmann (1999) chapter on the Trochilidae in the Handbook of the Birds of the World series now serves as the next best thing. At 213 pages, which include a field guide style painting of every species in the world plus perhaps the most spectacular set of photos of wild birds ever brought together, it is a major achievement. The text includes not only a solid introduction to the natural history of the family but 328 species accounts featuring 18 authors.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Closeup of  Southern Rockhopper Penguin  ( Eudyptes chrysocome ).       The number of extant penguin  species  is debated. Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably on account of there being no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands that  prey  on or attack penguins. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot           Main article:  Penguins in popular culture       Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Penguins   Fossil range:  Paleocene -Recent         Gentoo Penguin ,  Pygoscelis papua         Scientific classification             Kingdom:   Animalia       Phylum:   Chordata       Class:   Aves       Infraclass:   Neognathae       Order:   Sphenisciformes   Sharpe , 1891       Family:   Spheniscidae   Bonaparte , 1831             Modern  genera         Aptenodytes   Eudyptes   Eudyptula   Megadyptes   Pygoscelis   Spheniscus  For prehistoric genera, see  Systematics         Penguins  ( order   Sphenisciformes ,  family   Spheniscidae ) are a group of  aquatic ,  flightless   birds  living almost exclusively in the  Southern Hemisphere . Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Closeup of  Southern Rockhopper Penguin  ( Eudyptes chrysocome ).       The number of extant penguin  species  is debated. Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably on account of there being no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands that  prey  on or attack penguins. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 17 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 20 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 19 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 21 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 23 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 17 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 24 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 20 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 19 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 18 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 19 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 19 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 25 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 19 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 19 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 19 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 19 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 19 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 19 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 26 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 21 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 19 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 27 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 28 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 29 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 29 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 29 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot           Main article:  Penguins in popular culture       Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Penguins   Fossil range:  Paleocene -Recent         Gentoo Penguin ,  Pygoscelis papua         Scientific classification             Kingdom:   Animalia       Phylum:   Chordata       Class:   Aves       Infraclass:   Neognathae       Order:   Sphenisciformes   Sharpe , 1891       Family:   Spheniscidae   Bonaparte , 1831             Modern  genera         Aptenodytes   Eudyptes   Eudyptula   Megadyptes   Pygoscelis   Spheniscus  For prehistoric genera, see  Systematics         Penguins  ( order   Sphenisciformes ,  family   Spheniscidae ) are a group of  aquatic ,  flightless   birds  living almost exclusively in the  Southern Hemisphere . Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably on account of there being no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands that  prey  on or attack penguins. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Closeup of  Southern Rockhopper Penguin  ( Eudyptes chrysocome ).       The number of extant penguin  species  is debated. Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 17 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 20 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 19 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 21 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 23 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 17 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 24 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 20 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 19 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 18 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 19 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 19 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 25 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 19 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 19 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 19 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 19 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 19 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 19 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 26 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 21 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 19 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 27 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 28 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 29 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 29 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 29 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot           Main article:  Penguins in popular culture       Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably on account of there being no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands that  prey  on or attack penguins. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 17 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 20 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 19 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 21 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 23 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 17 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 24 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 20 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 19 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 18 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 19 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 19 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 25 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 19 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 19 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 19 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 19 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 19 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 19 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 26 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 21 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 19 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 27 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 28 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 29 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 29 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 29 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot           Main article:  Penguins in popular culture       Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

The 10,000 living species of  birds  have been  classified  as dinosaurs.   The term ""dinosaur"" was coined in 1842 by  Sir Richard Owen  and derives from  Greek     ( deinos ) ""terrible, powerful, wondrous"" +    ( sauros ) ""lizard"". It is sometimes used informally to describe other  prehistoric reptiles , such as the  pelycosaur   Dimetrodon , the winged  pterosaurs , and the aquatic  ichthyosaurs ,  plesiosaurs  and  mosasaurs , although none of these animals were dinosaurs. Through the first half of the 20th century, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been slow, unintelligent  cold-blooded  animals. Most  research conducted since the 1970s , however, has supported the view that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. The resulting transformation in the scientific understanding of dinosaurs has gradually filtered into popular consciousness.   The 1861 discovery of the primitive bird  Archaeopteryx  first suggested a close relationship between dinosaurs and birds. Aside from the presence of fossilized feather impressions,  Archaeopteryx  was very similar to the contemporary small predatory dinosaur  Compsognathus . Research has since identified  theropod  dinosaurs as the most likely direct ancestors of  birds ; most paleontologists today regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs, and some suggest that dinosaurs and birds should be grouped into one biological class. [ 1 ]  Aside from birds,  crocodilians  are the only other close relatives of dinosaurs to have survived until the present day. Like dinosaurs and birds, crocodilians are members of  Archosauria , a group of  reptiles  that first appeared in the very late  Permian  and came to predominate in the mid-Triassic.   Since the first dinosaur  fossils  were recognized in the early  nineteenth century , mounted dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular. They have been featured in best-selling books and films (notably  Jurassic Park ), and new discoveries are regularly covered by the  media .

[ 2 ]  The term is derived from the  Greek  words  ( deinos  meaning ""terrible"", ""powerful"", or ""wondrous"") and  ( saura  meaning ""lizard"" or ""reptile""). [ 3 ]  Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty. [ 4 ]  In colloquial English ""dinosaur"" is sometimes used to describe an obsolete or unsuccessful thing or person, [ 5 ]  despite the dinosaurs' 160 million year reign and the global abundance and diversity of their descendants, the birds.     Modern definition           Triceratops   skeleton  at the  American Museum of Natural History  in New York City.       Under  phylogenetic taxonomy , dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of "" Triceratops ,  Neornithes  [modern birds], their  most recent common ancestor , and all descendants."" [ 6 ]  It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the most recent common ancestor of  Megalosaurus  and  Iguanodon , because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria. [ 7 ]  Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs, including  theropods  (mostly  bipedal   carnivores ),  sauropodomorphs  (mostly large  herbivorous   quadrupeds  with long necks and tails),  ankylosaurians  (armored herbivorous quadrupeds),  stegosaurians  (plated herbivorous quadrupeds),  ceratopsians  (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), and  ornithopods  (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including ""duck-bills""). These definitions are written to correspond with scientific conceptions of dinosaurs that predate the modern use of phylogenetics. The continuity of meaning is intended to prevent confusion about what the term ""dinosaur"" means.   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict  cladistical  definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor must be included in a group for that group to be natural, birds  are  dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup  Maniraptora , which are  coelurosaurs , which are theropods, which are  saurischians , which are dinosaurs. [ 8 ]   From the point of view of cladistics, birds are dinosaurs, but in ordinary speech the word ""dinosaur"" does not include birds. Additionally, referring to dinosaurs that are not birds as ""non-avian dinosaurs"" is cumbersome. For clarity, this article will use ""dinosaur"" as a synonym for ""non-avian dinosaur"". The term ""non-avian dinosaur"" will be used for emphasis as needed. It is also technically correct to refer to dinosaurs as a distinct group under the older  Linnaean classification  system, which accepts  paraphyletic  taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor.     General description           Stegosaurus  skeleton,  Field Museum ,  Chicago .       Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs (aside from birds) can be generally described as terrestrial  archosaurian   reptiles  with  limbs held erect beneath the body , that existed from the  Late Triassic  (first appearing in the  Carnian   faunal stage ) to the  Late Cretaceous  (going extinct at the end of the  Maastrichtian ). [ 9 ]  Many prehistoric animals are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and  Dimetrodon , but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs. Marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs were neither terrestrial nor archosaurs; pterosaurs were archosaurs but not terrestrial; and  Dimetrodon  was a  Permian  animal more closely related to mammals. [ 10 ]  Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the  Jurassic  and Cretaceous. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded the size of a cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey. [ 11 ]  One notable exception is  Repenomamus giganticus , a  triconodont  weighing between 12 kilograms (26 lb) and 14 kilograms (31 lb) that is known to have eaten small dinosaurs like young  Psittacosaurus . [ 12 ]   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1,850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. [ 13 ]  An earlier study predicted that about 3,400 dinosaur genera existed, including many which would not have been preserved in the fossil record. [ 14 ]  As of September 17, 2008, 1,047 different species of dinosaurs have been named. [ 15 ]  Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds, and others, such as  Ammosaurus  and  Iguanodon , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Many had  bony armor , or cranial modifications like horns and crests. Although known for large size, many dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller. Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including  Antarctica . [ 16 ]  No dinosaurs are known to have lived in marine or aerial habitats, although it is possible some feathered theropods were flyers.     Distinguishing features   While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral  archosaurian  skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common features across a taxonomic group are called  synapomorphies .   Dinosaur synapomorphies include an elongated crest on the  humerus , or upper arm bone, to accommodate the attachment of  deltopectoral  muscles; a shelf at the rear of the  ilium , or main hip bone; a  tibia , or shin bone, featuring a broad lower edge and a flange pointing out and to the rear; and an ascending projection on the  astragalus , one of the ankle bones, which secures it to the tibia. [ 17 ]           Edmontonia  was an ""armored dinosaur"" of the group  Ankylosauria .       A variety of other skeletal features were shared by many dinosaurs. However, because they were either common to other groups of  archosaurs  or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as  diapsid  reptiles, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of  temporal fenestrae  (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the  snout  and lower jaw. [ 18 ]  Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated  scapula , or shoulder blade; a  sacrum  composed of three or more fused  vertebrae  (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in  Herrerasaurus ); [ 17 ]  and an  acetabulum , or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in  Saturnalia , for example). [ 19 ]  Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the Late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature. [ 20 ]          Hip joints and hindlimb postures.       Dinosaurs stood erect in a manner similar to  most modern mammals , but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side. [ 21 ]  Their posture was due to the development of a laterally-facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly-facing distinct head on the femur. [ 22 ]  Their erect posture enabled dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that  surpassed those of ""sprawling"" reptiles . [ 23 ]  Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs. [ 24 ]  Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including  rauisuchians , also had erect limbs but achieved this by a ""pillar erect"" configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the  upper pelvic bone  was rotated to form an overhanging shelf. [ 24 ]     Natural history     Origins and early evolution   Main article:  Evolution of dinosaurs           Eoraptor , an early dinosaur genus.       For a long time many scientists thought dinosaurs were  polyphyletic  with multiple groups of unrelated ""dinosaurs"" evolving due to similar pressures, [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  but dinosaurs are now known to have formed a single group. [ 28 ] [ 17 ]   Dinosaurs diverged from their  archosaur  ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late  Triassic  period, roughly 20 million years after the  Permian-Triassic extinction event  wiped out an estimated 95% of all  life on Earth . [ 29 ] [ 30 ]   Radiometric dating  of the  rock formation  that contained fossils from the early dinosaur  genus   Eoraptor  establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists believe  Eoraptor  resembles the  common ancestor  of all dinosaurs; [ 31 ]  if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal  predators . [ 32 ]  The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like  ornithodirans  such as  Marasuchus  and  Lagerpeton  in  Argentinian   Middle Triassic  strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.   When dinosaurs appeared, terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of basal archosaurs and  therapsids , such as  aetosaurs ,  cynodonts ,  dicynodonts ,  ornithosuchids ,  rauisuchias , and  rhynchosaurs . Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, in one of two events. First, at about the boundary between the  Carnian  and  Norian   faunal stages  (about 215 million years ago), dicynodonts and a variety of basal  archosauromorphs , including the  prolacertiforms  and rhynchosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the  Triassic-Jurassic extinction event  (about 200 million years ago), that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids,  phytosaurs , and rauisuchians. These losses left behind a land fauna of  crocodylomorphs , dinosaurs,  mammals ,  pterosaurians , and  turtles . [ 17 ]   The first few lines of primitive dinosaurs  diversified  through the  Carnian  and  Norian   stages  of the Triassic, most likely by occupying the niches of groups that became extinct. Traditionally, dinosaurs were thought to have  replaced  the variety of other Triassic land animals by proving superior through a long period of competition. This now appears unlikely, for several reasons. Dinosaurs do not show a pattern of steadily increasing in diversity and numbers, as would be predicted if they were competitively replacing other groups; instead, they were very rare through the Carnian, making up only 1-2% of individuals present in  faunas . In the Norian, however, after the extinction of several other groups, they became significant components of faunas, representing 50-90% of individuals. Also, what had been viewed as a key adaptation of dinosaurs, their erect stance, is now known to have present in several contemporaneous groups that were not as successful (aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, rauisuchians, and some groups of crocodylomorphs). Finally, the Late Triassic itself was a time of great upheaval in life, with shifts in plant life, marine life, and climate. [ 17 ]   Crurotarsans , today represented only by crocodilians but in the Late Triassic also encompassing such now-extinct groups as aetosaurs, phytosaurs, ornithosuchians, and rauisuchians, were actually more diverse in the Late Triassic than dinosaurs, indicating that the survival of dinosaurs had more to do with luck than superiority. [ 33 ]     Low diversification in the Cretaceous   Statistical analyses based on raw data suggest that dinosaurs diversified, i.e. the number of species increased, in the Late  Cretaceous . However in July 2008 Graeme T. Lloyd  et al.  argued that this apparent diversification was an illusion caused by  sampling bias , because Late Cretaceous rocks have been very heavily studied. Instead, they wrote, dinosaurs underwent only two significant diversifications in the Late Cretaceous, the initial  radiations  of the  euhadrosaurs  and  ceratopsians . In the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previous been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites  (fossilized dung) indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Meanwhile  herbivorous  insects and  mammals  diversified rapidly to take advantage of the new type of plant food, while lizards, snakes,  crocodilians  and  birds  also diversified at the same time. Lloyd  et al.  suggest that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Classification   Main article:  Dinosaur classification   Dinosaurs (including birds) are  archosaurs , like modern  crocodilians . Archosaurs'  diapsid  skulls have two holes, called  temporal fenestrae , located where the jaw muscles attach, and an additional  antorbital fenestra  in front of the eyes. Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called  synapsids ; and  turtles , with no temporal fenestra, are  anapsids . Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side.   Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a  superorder  or an unranked  clade . They are divided into two  orders ,  Saurischia  and  Ornithischia , depending upon  pelvic  structure. Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with  birds  than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all  taxa  sharing a more recent common ancestor with  Triceratops  than with Saurischia. Saurischians ('lizard-hipped', from the  Greek   sauros  (  ) meaning 'lizard' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') retained the hip structure of their ancestors, with a  pubis  bone directed  cranially , or forward. [ 22 ]  This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups ( Herrerasaurus , [ 35 ]   therizinosauroids , [ 36 ]   dromaeosaurids , [ 37 ]  and  birds [ 8 ] ). Saurischia includes the  theropods  (bipedal and mostly carnivores, except for birds) and  sauropodomorphs  (long-necked quadrupedal  herbivores ).   By contrast, ornithischians ('bird-hipped', from the  Greek   ornitheios  (  ) meaning 'of a bird' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird's pelvis: the  pubis  bone was oriented  caudally  (rear-pointing). Unlike birds, the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward-pointing process. Ornithischia includes a variety of herbivores. ( NB:  the terms ""lizard hip"" and ""bird-hip"" are misnomers  birds evolved from dinosaurs with ""lizard hips"".)

In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass  Pangaea , there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of  coelophysoid   carnivores  and  prosauropod   herbivores . [ 38 ]   Gymnosperm  plants (particularly  conifers ), a potential food source, radiated in the Late Triassic. Prosauropods did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. [ 39 ]  The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of  ceratosaurians ,  spinosauroids , and  carnosaurians , and herbivores consisting of  stegosaurian  ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the  Morrison Formation  of North America and  Tendaguru Beds  of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized  sinraptorid  theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like  Mamenchisaurus . [ 38 ]   Ankylosaurians  and  ornithopods  were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and  pteridophytes  were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential  cheek -like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. [ 39 ]  Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians . [ 8 ]          An Illustration of 18 species of basal ceratopsia to scale.       By the Early Cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians,  iguanodontians , and  brachiosaurids  through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large  spinosaurid  and  carcharodontosaurid  theropods, and  rebbachisaurid  and  titanosaurian  sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia,  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians  like  dromaeosaurids ,  troodontids , and  oviraptorosaurians  became the common theropods, and  ankylosaurids  and early  ceratopsians  like  Psittacosaurus  became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians,  hypsilophodonts , and iguanodontians. [ 38 ]  The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early Late Cretaceous. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of  flowering plants . At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries, taken to its extreme in  hadrosaurids . [ 39 ]  Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid  Nigersaurus . [ 40 ]   There were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were  tyrannosaurids  and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and  pachycephalosaurians . In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting  Gondwana ,  abelisaurids  were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids,  rhabdodontid  iguanodontians,  nodosaurid  ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent. [ 38 ]  Flowering plants were greatly radiating, [ 39 ]  with the first grasses appearing by the end of the Cretaceous. [ 41 ]  Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia. Theropods were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores, with  therizinosaurians  and  ornithomimosaurians  becoming common. [ 39 ]   The  CretaceousTertiary extinction event , which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the birds. Some other  diapsid  groups, such as crocodylians,  lizards ,  snakes ,  sphenodontians , and  choristoderans , also survived the event. [ 42 ]     Paleobiology   Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil records, including  fossilized   bones ,  feces ,  trackways ,  gastroliths ,  feathers , impressions of skin,  internal organs  and  soft tissues . [ 43 ] [ 44 ]  Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including  physics  (especially  biomechanics ),  chemistry ,  biology , and the  earth sciences  (of which  paleontology  is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.     Size   Main article:  Dinosaur size          Scale diagram comparing the largest known dinosaurs in four  suborders  and a human.       While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the  sauropods  were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an  order of magnitude  more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric  mammals  such as the  Indricotherium  and the Columbian  mammoth  were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach or surpass them in size  most notably the  blue whale , which reaches up to 173,000 kilograms (381,000 lb) and over 30 meters (100 ft) in length. [ 45 ]  There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but it may be that the most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in  rock formations  interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments. [ 46 ]   Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. [ 31 ]  Theropod dinosaurs, when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on  order of magnitude , most often fall into the 100 to 1,000 kilogram (220 to 2,200 lb) category, whereas  recent  predatory  carnivorans  peak in the 10 to 100 kilogram (22 to 220 lb) category. [ 47 ]  The  mode  of dinosaur body masses is between one and ten metric tonnes. [ 48 ]  This contrasts sharply with the size of  Cenozoic  mammals, estimated by the  National Museum of Natural History  as about 2 to 5 kilograms (5 to 10 lb). [ 49 ]     Largest and smallest   Only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the  largest and smallest dinosaurs .          Comparative size of  Brachiosaurus .       The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is  Brachiosaurus brancai  (also known as  Giraffatitan ). Its remains were discovered in  Tanzania  between 190712. Bones from multiple similarly-sized individuals were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the  Humboldt Museum  of  Berlin ; [ 50 ]  this mount is 12 meters (39 ft) tall and 22.5 meters (74 ft) long, and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between 30,000 and 60,000 kilograms (70,000 and 130,000 lb). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 m (89 ft) long  Diplodocus , which was discovered in  Wyoming  in the  United States  and displayed in  Pittsburgh's   Carnegie Natural History Museum  in 1907.          Comparative size of  Eoraptor .       There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils. Most of the largest  herbivorous  specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive  Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed 80,000 to 100,000 kilograms (90 to 110 short tons); some of the longest, the 33.5 meters (110 ft) long  Diplodocus hallorum [ 46 ]  (formerly  Seismosaurus ) and the 33 meters (110 ft) long  Supersaurus ; [ 51 ]  and the tallest, the 18 meters (59 ft)  Sauroposeidon , which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The longest of them all may have been  Amphicoelias fragillimus , known only from a now lost partial vertebral  neural arch  described in 1878. Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone, the animal may have been 58 meters (190 ft) long and weighed over 120,000 kilograms (260,000 lb), [ 46 ]  heavier than all known dinosaurs except possibly the poorly known  Bruhathkayosaurus , which could have weighed 175,000 to 220,000 kilograms (400,000 to 500,000 lb). The largest known  carnivorous  dinosaur was  Spinosaurus , reaching a length of 16 to 18 meters (50 to 60 ft), and weighing in at 8,150 kilograms (18,000 lb). [ 52 ]  Other large meat-eaters included  Giganotosaurus ,  Mapusaurus ,  Tyrannosaurus rex  and  Carcharodontosaurus .   Not including modern birds, the smallest dinosaurs known were about the size of a  pigeon . [ 53 ]  The theropods  Anchiornis  and  Epidexipteryx  both had a total skeletal length of under 35 centimeters (1.1 ft). [ 54 ] [ 53 ]   Anchiornis  is currently the smallest dinosaur described from an adult specimen, with an estimated weight of 110 grams. [ 54 ]  The smallest herbivorous dinosaurs included  Microceratus  and  Wannanosaurus , at about 60 cm long (2 ft) each. [ 55 ] [ 56 ]     Behavior          A nesting ground of  Maiasaura  was discovered in 1978.       Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their  habitat ,  computer simulations  of their  biomechanics , and comparisons with modern animals in similar  ecological niches . As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.   The first potential evidence of  herding  behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31  Iguanodon  dinosaurs which were then thought to have perished together in  Bernissart ,  Belgium , after they fell into a deep, flooded  sinkhole  and drowned. [ 57 ]  Other mass death sites have been subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that  duck-bills  (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the  American Bison  or the African  Springbok . Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in  Oxfordshire , England, [ 58 ]  although there is not evidence for specific herd structures. [ 59 ]  Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for  migratory  purposes, or to provide protection for their young. There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in  Inner Mongolia  that has yielded the remains of over twenty  Sinornithomimus , from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud. [ 60 ]  The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as  pack hunters  working together to bring down large prey. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  However, this lifestyle is uncommon among the modern relatives of dinosaurs ( crocodiles  and other reptiles, and  birds  -  Harris's Hawk  is a well-documented exception), and the  taphonomic  evidence suggesting pack hunting in such theropods as  Deinonychus  and  Allosaurus  can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern  diapsid  predators. [ 63 ]          Fossilized egg of the  oviraptorid   Citipati ,  American Museum of Natural History .       Jack Horner's  1978 discovery of a  Maiasaura  (""good mother dinosaur"")  nesting  ground in  Montana  demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the  ornithopods . [ 64 ]  There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like  Patagonian   titanosaurian  sauropods (1997 discovery), also nested in large groups. [ 65 ]  The  Mongolian   oviraptorid   Citipati  was discovered in a  chicken -like  brooding  position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the  eggs  warm. [ 66 ]  Parental care is also implied by other finds. For example, the fossilized remains of a grouping of  Psittacosaurus  has been found, consisting of one adult and 34 juveniles; in this case, the large number of juveniles may be due to communal nesting. [ 67 ]  Additionally, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the  prosauropod   Massospondylus ) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur. [ 68 ]  Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the  Isle of Skye  in northwestern  Scotland . [ 69 ]  Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.          Artist's rendering of two  Centrosaurus , herbivorous  ceratopsid  dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous fauna of North America.       The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the  marginocephalians ,  theropods  and  lambeosaurines , may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and  territorialism . Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations. [ 70 ]  The nature of dinosaur  communication  also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent studies suggest that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as  resonance chambers  used for a wide range of  vocalizations . [ 71 ] [ 72 ]   From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the  Gobi Desert  in 1971. It included a  Velociraptor  attacking a  Protoceratops , [ 73 ]  providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. [ 74 ]  Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially-healed tail of an  Edmontosaurus , a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. [ 74 ]   Cannibalism  amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod  Majungasaurus . [ 75 ]   Based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as  Oryctodromeus , some herbivorous species seem to have led a partially  fossorial  (burrowing) lifestyle, [ 76 ]  and some bird-like species may have been  arboreal  (tree-climbing), most notably primitive  dromaeosaurids  such as  Microraptor [ 77 ]  and the enigmatic  scansoriopterygids . [ 78 ]  However, most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of  biomechanics , in particular, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, [ 79 ]  whether  diplodocids  could create  sonic booms  via  whip -like tail snapping, [ 80 ]  and whether sauropods could float. [ 81 ]     Physiology   Main article:  Physiology of dinosaurs           Tyrannosaurus rex  skull and upper vertebral column, Palais de la Dcouverte, Paris.       A vigorous debate on the subject of temperature regulation in dinosaurs has been ongoing since the 1960s. Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur  endotherm  has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation.   After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were  ectothermic  creatures: ""terrible  lizards "" as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness implied that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, comparable to modern reptiles, which need external sources of heat in order to regulate their body temperature. Dinosaur ectothermy remained a prevalent view until  Robert T. ""Bob"" Bakker , an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968.   Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (perhaps aided by the animals' bulk). Evidence of  endotherm  in dinosaurs includes the discovery of  polar dinosaurs in Australia  and  Antarctica  (where they would have experienced a cold, dark six-month winter), the discovery of dinosaurs whose feathers may have provided regulatory insulation, and analysis of blood-vessel structures that are typical of endotherms within dinosaur bone. Skeletal structures suggest that theropods and other dinosaurs had active lifestyles better suited to an endothermic cardiovascular system, while sauropods exhibit fewer endothermic characteristics. It is certainly possible that some dinosaurs were endothermic while others were not. Scientific debate over the specifics continues. [ 82 ]           Eubrontes , a dinosaur footprint in the Lower  Jurassic  Moenave Formation at the St. George Dinosaur Discovery Site at Johnson Farm, southwestern Utah.       Complicating the debate is the fact that warm-bloodedness can emerge based on more than one mechanism. Most discussions of dinosaur endothermy tend to compare them to average birds or mammals, which expend energy to elevate body temperature above that of the environment. Small birds and mammals also possess  insulation , such as  fat ,  fur , or  feathers , which slows down heat loss. However, large mammals, such as elephants, face a different problem because of their relatively small ratio of surface area to volume ( Haldane's  principle). This ratio compares the volume of an animal with the area of its skin: as an animal gets bigger, its surface area increases more slowly than its volume. At a certain point, the amount of heat radiated away through the skin drops below the amount of heat produced inside the body, forcing animals to use additional methods to avoid overheating. In the case of elephants, they have little hair as adults, and have large ears which increase their surface area, and have behavioral adaptations as well (such as using the trunk to spray water on themselves and mud wallowing). These behaviors increase cooling through evaporation.   Large dinosaurs would presumably have had to deal with similar issues; their body size suggest they lost heat relatively slowly to the surrounding air, and so could have been what are called  inertial homeotherms , animals that are warmer than their environments through sheer size rather than through special adaptations like those of birds or mammals. However, so far this theory fails to account for the numerous dog- and goat-sized dinosaur species, or the young of larger species.   Modern  computerized tomography  (CT) scans of a  dinosaur 's chest cavity (conducted in 2000) found the apparent remnants of a four-chambered heart, much like those found in today's mammals and birds. [ 83 ]  The idea is controversial within the scientific community, coming under fire for bad anatomical science [ 84 ]  or simply wishful thinking. [ 85 ]  The question of how this find reflects on metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy may be moot, though, regardless of the object's identity: both modern  crocodilians  and  birds , the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well. [ 86 ]     Soft tissue and DNA           Scipionyx samniticus  fossil showing tissue impressions, at the  Museo Civico di Storia Naturale , in Milan, Italy.       One of the best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in  Petraroia ,  Italy . The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young  coelurosaur ,  Scipionyx  samniticus . The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur. [ 43 ]   In the March 2005 issue of  Science , the paleontologist  Mary Higby Schweitzer  and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old  Tyrannosaurus rex  leg  bone  from the  Hell Creek Formation  in  Montana . After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team. [ 44 ]   When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as  blood vessels , bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear; study and interpretation of the material is ongoing. [ 44 ]   Newer research, published in PloS One (30 July 2008), has challenged the claims that the material found is the soft tissue of  Tyrannosaurus . Thomas Kaye of the  University of Washington  and his co-authors contend that what was really inside the tyrannosaur bone was slimy  biofilm  created by bacteria that coated the voids once occupied by blood vessels and cells. [ 87 ]  The researchers found that what previously had been identified as remnants of blood cells, because of the presence of iron, were actually  framboids , microscopic mineral spheres bearing iron. They found similar spheres in a variety of other fossils from various periods, including an  ammonite . In the ammonite they found the spheres in a place where the iron they contain could not have had any relationship to the presence of blood. [ 88 ]   The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions, but upon further inspection and  peer review , neither of these reports could be confirmed. [ 89 ]  However, a functional visual  peptide  of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds. [ 90 ]  In addition, several  proteins  have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils, [ 91 ]  including hemoglobin. [ 92 ]   Even if dinosaur DNA could be reconstructed, it would be exceedingly difficult to clone and ""grow"" dinosaurs using current technology since no closely related species exist to provide  zygotes  or a suitable environment for  embryonic development .     Feathers and the origin of birds   Main article:  Origin of birds   The possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by  Thomas Henry Huxley . [ 93 ]  After the work of  Gerhard Heilmann  in the early 20th century, the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of generalized  thecodont  ancestors, with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of  clavicles  in dinosaurs. [ 94 ]  However, as later discoveries showed, clavicles (or a single fused  wishbone , which derived from separate clavicles) were not actually absent; [ 8 ]  they had been found as early as 1924 in  Oviraptor , but misidentified as an  interclavicle . [ 95 ]  In the 1970s,  John Ostrom  revived the dinosaur-bird theory, [ 96 ]  which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis, [ 97 ]  and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds. [ 18 ]  Of particular note has been the fossils of the  Yixian Formation , where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found, often with feathers of some type. [ 8 ]  Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives. [ 98 ]  They are most closely allied with  maniraptoran  coelurosaurs. [ 8 ]  A minority of scientists, most notably  Alan Feduccia  and  Larry Martin , have proposed other evolutionary paths, including revised versions of Heilmann's basal archosaur proposal, [ 99 ]  or that maniraptoran theropods are the ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs, only  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ]     Feathers   Main article:  Feathered dinosaurs          The famous Berlin Specimen of  Archaeopteryx lithographica .       Archaeopteryx , the first good example of a ""feathered dinosaur"", was discovered in 1861. The initial specimen was found in the  Solnhofen limestone  in southern Germany, which is a  lagersttte , a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils.  Archaeopteryx  is a  transitional fossil , with features clearly intermediate between those of modern reptiles and birds. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal  The Origin of Species , its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of  evolutionary biology  and  creationism . This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for  Compsognathus . [ 101 ]   Since the 1990s, a number of additional  feathered dinosaurs  have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the  lagersttte  of the Yixian Formation,  Liaoning , northeastern  China , which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found only in a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be due to the fact that delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by  fossilization  and thus are absent from the fossil record. To this point, protofeathers (thin, filament-like structures) are known from dinosaurs at the base of Coelurosauria, such as  compsognathids  like  Sinosauropteryx  and  tyrannosauroids  ( Dilong ), [ 102 ]  but barbed feathers are only known among the coelurosaur subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. [ 8 ] [ 103 ]  The description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that protofeathers are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' integument, [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with barbed feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ] [ 105 ]  However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the question of the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been raised. [ 107 ]     Skeleton   Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the  missing link  between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for  paleontologists . Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck,  pubis ,  wrist  (semi-lunate  carpal ), arm and  pectoral girdle , furcula (wishbone), and  breast bone . Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through  cladistic analysis  strengthens the case for the link.     Soft anatomy   Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation which was led by  Patrick O'Connor  of  Ohio University . The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their  skeletons , as is the case in birds. ""What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds"", O'Connor said. [ 108 ]  In a paper published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE (September 29, 2008), scientists described  Aerosteon riocoloradensis , the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like breathing system.  CT-scanning  revealed the evidence of air sacs within the body cavity of the  Aerosteon  skeleton. [ 109 ] [ 110 ]   Another piece of evidence that birds and dinosaurs are closely related is the use of  gizzard  stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with  fossils , gizzard stones are called  gastroliths . [ 111 ]     Reproductive biology   A discovery of features in a  Tyrannosaurus rex   skeleton  recently provided more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs between the hard outer bone and the  marrow . This  medullary  bone, which is rich in  calcium , is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally-derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the  Tyrannosaurus rex  specimen's hind limb suggested that  T. rex  used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female. [ 112 ]  Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod  Allosaurus  and ornithopod  Tenontosaurus . Because the line of dinosaurs that includes  Allosaurus  and  Tyrannosaurus  diverged from the line that led to  Tenontosaurus  very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue. Medullary bone has been found in specimens of sub-adult size, which suggests that dinosaurs reached sexual maturity rather quickly for such large animals. [ 113 ]     Behavioral evidence   A recently discovered  troodont  fossil demonstrates that some dinosaurs slept with their heads tucked under their arms. [ 114 ]  This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds.     Extinction   Main articles:  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  and  KT boundary   Non-avian dinosaurs suddenly became  extinct  approximately 65 million years ago. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including  ammonites  ( nautilus -like  mollusks ),  mosasaurs , plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, herbivorous  turtles  and  crocodiles , most birds, and many groups of mammals. [ 16 ]  This  mass extinction  is known as the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event . The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the general consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.   At the peak of the Mesozoic, there were no  polar ice caps , and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250 meters (300 to 800 ft) higher than they are today. The planet's temperature was also much more uniform, with only 25  C  (45  F ) separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator. On average, atmospheric temperatures were also much warmer; the poles, for example, were 50 C (90 F) warmer than today. [ 115 ] [ 116 ]   The atmosphere's composition during the Mesozoic was vastly different as well. Carbon dioxide levels were up to 12 times higher than today's levels, and oxygen formed 32 to 35% of the atmosphere, as compared to 21% today. However, by the late Cretaceous, the environment was changing dramatically. Volcanic activity was decreasing, which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably. Some scientists hypothesize that climate change, combined with lower oxygen levels, might have led directly to the demise of many species. If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds, it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency, given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies. [ 16 ]     Impact event   Main article:  Chicxulub crater          The  Chicxulub Crater  at the tip of the  Yucatn Peninsula ; the impactor that formed this crater may have caused the dinosaur extinction.       The asteroid collision theory, which was brought to wide attention in 1980 by  Walter Alvarez  and colleagues, links the  extinction event  at the end of the Cretaceous period to a  bolide  impact approximately 65.5 million years ago. Alvarez  et al.  proposed that a sudden increase in  iridium  levels, recorded around the world in the period's rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. [ 117 ]  The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a 5 to 15 kilometer (3 to 9 mi) wide  bolide  hit in the vicinity of the  Yucatn Peninsula , creating the 170 kilometers (110 mi) wide  Chicxulub Crater  and triggering the  mass extinction . [ 118 ]  Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the  impact event . Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave.   Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun).   In September 2007, U.S. researchers led by  William Bottke  of the  Southwest Research Institute  in  Boulder, Colorado , and  Czech  scientists used  computer  simulations to identify the probable source of the Chicxulub impact. They calculated a 90% probability that a giant asteroid named  Baptistina , approximately 160 kilometers (100 mi) in diameter, orbiting in the asteroid belt which lies between  Mars  and  Jupiter , was struck by a smaller unnamed asteroid about 55 kilometers (35 mi) in diameter about 160 million years ago. The impact shattered Baptistina, creating a cluster which still exists today as the  Baptistina family . Calculations indicate that some of the fragments were sent hurtling into earth-crossing orbits, one of which was the 10 kilometers (6 mi) wide  meteorite  which struck  Mexico 's  Yucatan   peninsula  65 million years ago, creating the  Chicxulub crater  (175 kilometers (110 mi)). [ 119 ]   While similar to Alvarez's impact theory (which involved a single asteroid or comet), this theory proposes that ""passages of the  solar companion star Nemesis  through the  Oort comet cloud  would trigger comet showers."" [ 120 ]  One or more of these objects then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time, causing the worldwide extinction. As with the impact of a single asteroid, the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures, followed by a protracted cool period. [ 120 ]     Deccan Traps   Main article:  Deccan Traps   Before 2000, arguments that the  Deccan Traps   flood basalts  caused the  extinction  were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 mya and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two-thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in 1 million years about 65.5 mya, so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly a period of thousands of years, but still a longer period than what would be expected from a single impact event. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulphuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reducing photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the  greenhouse effect  when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere. [ 122 ]  Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of  volcanic gasses  during the formation of the  Deccan traps  ""contributed to an apparently massive  global warming . Some data point to an average rise in temperature of 8 C (14 F) in the last half million years before the  impact [at Chicxulub] ."" [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction,  Luis Alvarez  (who died in 1988) replied that  paleontologists  were being misled by  sparse data . While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in  sea level  and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions. [ 123 ]     Failure to adapt to changing conditions   Lloyd  et al.  (2008) noted that, in the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previously been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites   fossilized dung  indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Statistical analysis by Lloyd  et al.  concluded that, contrary to earlier studies, dinosaurs did not diversify very much in the Late Cretaceous. Lloyd  et al.  suggested that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Possible Paleocene survivors   Nonavian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the  K-T boundary . In 2002, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single  hadrosaur  leg bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico and described it as evidence of  Paleocene dinosaurs . The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early  Paleocene  epoch approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that  stratum  by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era. [ 124 ]  Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the  Hell Creek Formation  up to 1.3 meters (51 in) above (40,000 years later than) the K-T boundary. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China. [ 125 ]  Many scientists, however, dismiss the ""Paleocene dinosaurs"" as re-worked, i.e. washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments, [ 126 ] [ 127 ]  or find that, if correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction. [ 126 ]     History of discovery   Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese, whose modern word for dinosaur is  konglong  (, or ""terrible dragon""), considered them to be  dragon   bones  and documented them as such. For example,  Hua Yang Guo Zhi , a book written by Zhang Qu during the  Western Jin Dynasty , reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in  Sichuan  Province. [ 128 ]  Villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized ""dragon bones"" for use in traditional medicines, a practice that continues today. [ 129 ]  In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of  giants  and other creatures killed by the  Great Flood .   Scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in  England . Part of a bone, now known to have been the  femur  of a  Megalosaurus , [ 130 ]  was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near  Chipping Norton ,  Oxfordshire , England in 1676. The fragment was sent to  Robert Plot , Professor of Chemistry at the  University of Oxford  and first curator of the  Ashmolean Museum , who published a description in his  Natural History of Oxfordshire  in 1677. He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the  femur  of a large animal, but recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species. He therefore concluded it to be the thigh bone of a giant human similar to those mentioned in the  Bible . In 1699,  Edward Lhuyd , a friend of  Sir Isaac Newton , was responsible for the first published scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a  sauropod   tooth , "" Rutellum implicatum "" [ 131 ] [ 132 ] , that had been found in Caswell, near Whitney, Oxfordshire. [ 133 ]           William Buckland .       Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev  William Buckland , a professor of  geology  at  Oxford University , collected more fossilized bones of  Megalosaurus  and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a  scientific journal . [ 134 ] [ 130 ]  The second dinosaur genus to be identified,  Iguanodon , was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell - the wife of English geologist  Gideon Mantell . Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between  his fossils  and the bones of modern  iguanas . He published his findings in 1825. [ 135 ] [ 136 ]   The study of these ""great fossil lizards"" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist  Richard Owen  coined the term ""dinosaur"". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far,  Iguanodon ,  Megalosaurus  and  Hylaeosaurus , shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of  Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha , the husband of  Queen Victoria , Owen established the  Natural History Museum  in  South Kensington ,  London , to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.   In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in  marl  pits in the small town of  Haddonfield, New Jersey  (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named  Hadrosaurus  foulkii . It was an extremely important find;  Hadrosaurus  was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found and it was clearly a  bipedal  creature. ( The first  was in 1834, in Maidstone, Kent, England) This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the  United States .           Othniel Charles Marsh , 19th century photograph.               Edward Drinker Cope , 19th century photograph.       Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Othniel Charles Marsh , both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the  Bone Wars . The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an  Elasmosaurus  skeleton was flawed; Cope had inadvertently placed the  plesiosaur 's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the  US Geological Survey . Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods; for example, their diggers often used  dynamite  to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast; Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, for a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the  American Museum of Natural History  in  New York , while Marsh's is on display at the  Peabody Museum of Natural History  at  Yale University . [ 137 ]   Since 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils has extended to every continent, including  Antarctica . The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the  ankylosaurid   Antarctopelta oliveroi , was found on  Ross Island  in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod  Cryolophosaurus ellioti , was formally named and described in a scientific journal.   Current dinosaur ""hot spots"" include southern South America (especially  Argentina ) and  China . China in particular has produced many exceptional  feathered dinosaur  specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to  fossilization .     The ""dinosaur renaissance""   Main article:  Dinosaur renaissance   The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by  John Ostrom 's discovery of  Deinonychus , an active predator that may have been  warm-blooded , in marked contrast to the then-prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and  cold-blooded .  Vertebrate paleontology  has become a global  science . Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including  India , South America,  Madagascar ,  Antarctica , and most significantly in  China  (the amazingly well-preserved  feathered dinosaurs  in  China  have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of  cladistics , which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in  classifying  dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary  fossil record .     Cultural depictions   Main article:  Cultural depictions of dinosaurs          A  Megalosaurus  stalks  Crystal Palace Park  in  London .       By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word ""dinosaur"" into the common  vernacular  reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, ""dinosaur"" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, slow-moving, obsolete, or bound for extinction. [ 138 ]   Public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in  Victorian  England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, the famous  dinosaur sculptures  were unveiled in  London 's  Crystal Palace Park . The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and  museums  around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way. [ 139 ]  Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the  Bone Wars  of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions. [ 140 ]   The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in  literature ,  film  and other  media . Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in  Charles Dickens'   Bleak House , [ 141 ]  dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of  fictional  works.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's 1912 book  The Lost World , the iconic 1933  film   King Kong , 1954's  Godzilla  and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel  Jurassic Park  by  Michael Crichton  and its 1993  film adaptation  are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest  non-fictional  works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in  advertising ; numerous  companies  have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted or obsolete. [ 142 ]     Religious views   Main article:  Young Earth Creationism#Palaeontology and dinosaurs   Various religious groups have views about dinosaurs that differ from those held by the vast majority of scientists, usually due to conflicts with  creation stories  in their scriptures. However, most of the  scientific  community rejects these religiously-inspired interpretations of dinosaurs.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Depending on which authority is followed, penguin  biodiversity  varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the  subfamily   Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins . [ 14 ]   Updated after Marples (1962), Acosta Hospitaleche (2004), and Ksepka  et al.  (2006).

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

At the end of the  Cretaceous   Period , 65 million years ago, dinosaurs experienced a catastrophic  extinction , which ended their dominance on land.  Taxonomists  consider modern birds to be the direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs.    Since the first dinosaur was recognized in the 19th century, mounted, fossilized dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at  museums  around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular among children and adults alike. They have been featured in best-selling books and films such as  Jurassic Park , and new discoveries are regularly covered by the  media .  The term  dinosaur   is sometimes used informally to describe other prehistoric reptiles, such as the  pelycosaur   Dimetrodon , the winged  pterosaurs  and the aquatic  ichthyosaurs ,  plesiosaurs  and  mosasaurs , although technically none of these were dinosaurs.

Definition   Image:Triceratops 1.jpg   The  taxon   Dinosauria  was formally named by the  English   palaeontologist   Richard Owen  in 1842 as ""a distinct tribe or suborder of Saurian reptiles"".<ref>* Owen, Richard.  1842.  ""Report on British Fossil Reptiles."" Part II.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.<ref>Fountain, Henry.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 103:37, pp. 13601-13605.  [2] [3] </ref>  Some were  herbivorous , others  carnivorous . Some dinosaurs were  bipeds , some were  quadrupeds , and others, such as  Ammosaurus  and  Iguanodon , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.  Dinosaur  synapomorphies   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral  archosaurian  skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.  Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the  manus  ('hand'), reduced number of digits on the  pes  (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate  acetabulum  (hip socket with a hole at its centre). Dinosaurs (including birds) are unique among all  tetrapods  in having this perforate acetabulum.   Other shared anatomical features   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a  diapsid  skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.  The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.    Image:Stegosaurus Struct.jpg   Taxonomic definition   Under  phylogenetic taxonomy , dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of  Triceratops  and modern  birds . They are divided into  Ornithischia  ( bird-hipped ) and  Saurischia  ( lizard-hipped ), depending upon  pelvic  structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing)  pubis  bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only. Ornithischia includes all  taxa  sharing a more recent common ancestor with  Triceratops  than with Saurischia, while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with  birds  than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of  Megalosaurus  and  Iguanodon , because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria.  There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that  birds  are the descendants of  theropod  dinosaurs. Using the strict  cladistical  definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds  are  dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern  birds  are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup  Maniraptora , which are  coelurosaurs , which are  theropods , which are  saurischians , which are dinosaurs.  However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among  ornithologists . It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older  Linnaean classification  system, which accepts  paraphyletic  taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use  cladistics , which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of  Archaeopteryx  and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this article's definition of 'bird' differs from the definition common in everyday language; to most non-scientists, a 'bird' is simply a two-legged animal with wings and feathers.      Size   While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the  sauropods  were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an  order of magnitude  more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric  mammals  such as the  Indricotherium  and the Columbian  mammoth  were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach or surpass them in size — most notably the  blue whale , which reaches up to 190,000 kg (209 tons) and 33.5 m (110 ft) in length.  Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.<ref> Dinosaur size varied in different periods  Working hypothesis for body size.</ref> According to paleontologist Bill Erickson, estimates of median dinosaur weight range from 500 kg to 5  tonnes ; a recent study of 63 dinosaur genera yielded an average weight greater than 850 kg — comparable to the weight of a grizzly bear — and a median weight of nearly 2 tons, or about as much as a giraffe.  This contrasts sharply with the size of modern mammals; on average, mammals weigh only 863 grams, or about as much as a large rodent.  The smallest dinosaur was bigger than two-thirds of all current mammals; the majority of dinosaurs were bigger than all but 2% of living mammals.<ref> Origin of Dinosaurs and Mammals - Erickson  Soruce of Erickson quote.</ref>      Largest and smallest dinosaurs   Only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the  largest and smallest dinosaurs .   Image:Trex1.png  The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from a complete skeleton is the  Brachiosaurus  specimen that was discovered in  Tanzania  between 1907–12.  It is now mounted and on display at the  Humboldt Museum  of  Berlin  and is 12 m (38 ft) tall and probably weighed between 30,00060,000 kg (33–66  short tons ). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 m (89 ft) long  Diplodocus , which was discovered in  Wyoming  in the  United States  and displayed in  Pittsburgh 's  Carnegie Natural History Museum  in 1907.  There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of incomplete fossil samples. The largest  herbivorous  specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive  Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed 80,000100,000 kg (88–121 tons); the longest, the 40 m (130 ft) long  Supersaurus ; and the tallest, the 18 m (60 ft)  Sauroposeidon , which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The largest known  carnivorous  dinosaur was  Spinosaurus , reaching a length of 16-18 meters (53-60 ft), and weighing in at 9 tons.  Other large meat-eaters included  Giganotosaurus ,  Mapusaurus ,  Tyrannosaurus rex  and  Carcharodontosaurus .  Not including modern birds like the  bee hummingbird , the smallest dinosaurs known were about the size of a  crow  or a  chicken . The theropods  Microraptor ,  Parvicursor , and  Saltopus  were all under 60 cm (2 ft) in length.      Behavior    Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their  habitat ,  computer simulations  of their  biomechanics , and comparisons with modern animals in similar  ecological niches . As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.   The first perceived direct evidence of  herding  behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31  Iguanodon  dinosaurs which were thought to have perished together in  Bernissart ,  Belgium , after they fell into a deep, flooded  sinkhole  and drowned.<ref>Johan Yans, Jean Dejax, Denise Pons, Christian Dupuis, Philippe Taquet.(2005) Palaeontological and geodynamical implications of the palynological dating of the wealden facies sediments of Bernissart (Mons Basin, Belgium).

Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that  herd  or  pack  behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that  duck-bills  (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the  American Bison  or the African  Springbok . Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in  Oxford , England,<ref>Day, J.J. and Upchurch, P. (2002). Sauropod Trackways, Evolution, and Behavior.  Science  296:1659.  See commentary on the article </ref> and others kept their young in the middle of the herd for defense according to trackways at Davenport Ranch,  Texas . Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for  migratory  purposes, or to provide protection for their young.  Jack Horner 's 1978 discovery of a  Maiasaura  (""good mother dinosaur"")  nesting  ground in  Montana  demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the  ornithopods .<ref>Lessem, D. and Glut, D.F.

See commentary on the article </ref><ref> Juvenile Tyrannosaur  A juvenile  Tyrannosaur  skeleton was found.</ref> There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like the  Patagonian  sauropod  Saltasaurus  (1997 discovery), had similar nesting behaviors, and that the animals congregated in huge nesting colonies like those of  penguins . The  Mongolian   maniraptoran   Oviraptor  was discovered in a  chicken -like  brooding  position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the  eggs  warm.<ref> Oviraptor nesting   Oviraptor  nests or  Protoceratops ?</ref> Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among sauropods and ornithopods from the  Isle of Skye  in northwestern  Scotland .<ref> Dinosaur family tracks  Footprints show maternal instinct after leaving the nest.</ref> Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.  The  crests  and frills of some dinosaurs, like the  marginocephalians ,  theropods  and  lambeosaurines , may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and  territorialism . The nature of dinosaur  communication  also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent evidence suggests that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as  resonance chambers  used for a wide range of  vocalizations .  From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the  Gobi Desert  in 1971. It included a  Velociraptor  attacking a  Protoceratops ,<ref> Joined forever in death  The discovery of two  fossil  dinosaurs entangled together proved many theories.</ref> proving that dinosaurs did indeed attack and eat each other.

The first few lines of primitive dinosaurs  diversified rapidly  through the rest of the Triassic period; dinosaur species quickly evolved the specialized features and range of sizes needed to exploit nearly every terrestrial  ecological niche . During the period of dinosaur predominance, which encompassed the ensuing  Jurassic  and  Cretaceous  periods, nearly every known land animal larger than 1 meter in length was a dinosaur.  The  Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event , which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the line that had already given rise to the first birds. Other  diapsid  species related to the dinosaurs also survived the event.

This was triggered, in part, by  John Ostrom 's discovery of  Deinonychus , an active, vicious  predator  that may have been  warm-blooded , in marked contrast to the prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and  cold-blooded .  Vertebrate paleontology , arguably the primary scientific discipline involved in dinosaur research, has become a global  science . Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including  India ,  South America ,  Madagascar ,  Antarctica , and most significantly in  China  (the amazingly well-preserved  feathered dinosaurs  in  China  have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern  birds ). The widespread application of  cladistics , which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in  classifying  dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary  fossil record .    See also:  List of U.S. state dinosaurs       Classification   Main article :  Dinosaur classification    Dinosaurs (including birds) are  archosaurs , like modern  crocodilians .  Archosaurs'  diapsid  skulls have two holes located where the jaw muscles attach, called  temporal fenestrae . Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called  synapsids ; and  turtles , with no temporal fenestra, are  anapsids . Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones.  Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side. All dinosaurs were land animals.   Many other types of reptiles lived at the same time as the dinosaurs. Some of these are commonly, but incorrectly, thought of as dinosaurs, including  plesiosaurs  (which are not closely related to the dinosaurs) and  pterosaurs , which developed separately from reptilian ancestors in the late Triassic period.  Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a  superorder  or an unranked  clade . They are divided into two  orders , the  Saurischia  and the  Ornithischia , on the basis of their hip structure. Saurischians ('lizard-hipped', from the  Greek   sauros  ( ñ ) meaning 'lizard' and  ischion  ( ǹ ) meaning 'hip joint') are dinosaurs that originally retained the hip structure of their ancestors. They include all the  theropods  (bipedal  carnivores ) and  sauropods  (long-necked  herbivores ). Ornithischians ('bird-hipped', from the  Greek   ornitheos  (  ) meaning 'of a bird' and  ischion  ( ǹ ) meaning 'hip joint') is the other dinosaurian order, most of which were  quadrupedal  herbivores. ( NB:  the terms ""lizard hip"" and ""bird-hip"" are misnomers — birds evolved from dinosaurs with ""lizard hips"".)

Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur  endothermy  has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation.   After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were  ectothermic  creatures: ""terrible  lizards "" as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness implied that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, comparable to modern reptiles, which need external sources of heat in order to regulate their body temperature. Dinosaur ectothermy remained a prevalent view until  Robert T. ""Bob"" Bakker , an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968.   Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (perhaps aided by the animals' bulk).  Evidence of  endothermism  in dinosaurs includes the discovery of  polar dinosaurs in Australia  and  Antarctica  (where they woul  "

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

clueweb09-en0004-21-09263	"                     Dinosaur Information     Dino Russ's Lair  is      © 2005 By Russell J. Jacobson                  Brachiosaurus                                   2001. Acrylic on illustration board. 8""x7"".                  Weighing almost seventy tons,  Brachiosaurus  was one of the biggest      land animals that has ever lived. Since its front legs were longer than its      hind legs, Brachiosaurus had a more upright stance than most sauropods. This      dinosaur could raise its head almost forty feet off the ground to graze high      in the trees and must have looked like a titanic, reptilian giraffe. However,      since Brachiosaurus lived over one hundred million years before the first      giraffe appeared, it may be more appropriate to say that giraffes resemble      tiny, mammalian Brachiosaurs! The figure of a six-foot tall man helps illustrate      how immense this creature was.            Note this image is copyright © by  Joe      Tucciarone  and is used by his permission;.

This sample thematic unit has been adapted from            Legacies: Using Children's Literature in the Classroom written by Liz            Rothlein and Anita Meyer Meinbach. HarperCollins College Publishers,            1996, pp. 432-438.                           Theme: Dinosaurs                Focus: Students will explore prehistoric times to expand their                knowledge of dinosaurs.               Grade Level: Primary                Objectives: On completion of this thematic unit, students will                be able to:                                   1. Identify at least ten different dinosaurs and name them.                   2. Explain the difference between plant-eating dinosaurs and                    meat-eating dinosaurs.                   3. Explain how scientists know as much as they do about dinosaurs                   4. Describe the period of time when dinosaurs lived on earth.                   5. Identify dinosaurs that lived on land versus prehistoric                    creatures that lived in the sea or flew in the air.                    6. Compare various sizes, weights, and body shapes of dinosaurs.                                                                     42eXplore - Dinosaurs .            Part of Eduscape. Don't start with a search engine, start with 42explore!            When you're learning something new, it's nice to have more than one            resource to explore. This web project provides ""four to eXplore""            for each topic. On each page you'll find definitions, activities, the            4 good starting points, and many more links and resources for the thematic            topic.                                     Jurassic            Park Institute teachers resources  Teacher Resources is your guide            to the JPI Dino Lab. The group lesson plans and corresponding student            activities are designed to build an understanding about dinosaurs, the            science of paleontology, what paleontologists do, and how scientists,            especially paleontologists, think and solve problems.                           The web site authors want children to use all of their intelligences                and have fun while they learn, lessons will contain opportunities                for students to raise questions; gather, display, analyze and interpret                data; explore relationships and seek correlations; and develop models                and theories about dinosaurs. These lesson plans were strategically                created for teachers by teachers and incorporate many helpful and                easy-to-implement teaching tools, including objectives, background                information, a description of the lesson, discussion questions and                resources, extensions and adaptations for younger/older students,                the national science education standards, and student assessment                and evaluation recommendations.               You will find that the lesson plans are grouped by thematic units.                Each of the thematic units will allow you to pick and choose from                a variety of online investigations and hands-on/minds-on activities.                You can do all of the lessons in order so that your students will                acquire all of the necessary background knowledge needed to tackle                the large complex challenge/problem, or you can start with the large                complex challenge and select from among the sub-lessons as specific                pieces of information or skills are needed.               Nests & Nurturing module  you and your students                can investigate how dinosaurs raised and cared for their young.                                             KWL CHARTS Students create a dinosaur K-W-L chart (What I think                  I know - What I want to find out - What I learned).                 DINOSAUR EGGS Students study fossilized dinosaur eggs and nests,                  identify general dinosaur egg shapes, and match shapes with likely                  dinosaur types                 ANIMAL PARENTS Students will identify which animals do not protect                  nests or care for animals and compare bird hatchlings that leave                  a nest quickly with those that are helpless and stay in the nest.                 DINOSAUR BABIES AND PARENTS Students will find out what evidence                  paleontologists look for and what it tells them about dinosaur                  behavior.                             Dino Hunters Module  Just like forensic scientists                use deductive logic to solve crimes, your students will become paleontology                detectives as they piece together information and generate hypotheses                about prehistoric environments, plants, and animals.                                   Dinosaur Names:Students will identify conventions used to                    name dinosaurs, compare dinosaurs and their names, and make                    up dinosaur names.                   Field NotesStudents will study paleontologist field journals.Students                    will reflect on paleontologist field journals. Students will                    gather, record, and communicate observations.                                             Dig Site:  Western Canada contains some the richest                dinosaur fossil sites in the world. The lessons contained within                this section will take you and your students on a journey to several                of these sites.                                   NESTS & NURTURING Students will identify two major questions                    raised by finds in Alberta, consider evidence, draw conclusions,                    and write a journal report or grant proposal for further study.                   TRACKWAYS: PEACE RIVER CANYON DIG SITE This lesson builds                    upon material already learned and creates an exciting extension                    by introducing a new and exciting set of problems that are currently                    being investigated by paleontologists.                                                         Southwest            Educational Development Laboratory -DINOSAURS  One of the units (of            a series) designed to assist teachers in offering up-to-date science            and mathematics content, along with appropriate language usage, through            teaching and learning strategies that will excite children about the            world of mathematics, science and language. The selection and arrangement            of the material is planned to engage children's natural inquisitive            nature and to stimulate them to investigate, explore and learn. Teachers            are helped to create dissonance in familiar situations in order to stimulate            questioning, hypothesizing, exploring and problem solving.                                         Each unit contains three types of materials :                                (1) unit overview materials and background information for                  the teacher,                  (2) the lessons:                                        Lesson 1: Long Ago                      Lesson 2: Extinction                      Lesson 3: Fossils                      Lesson 4: Types of Dinosaurs                      Lesson 5: Meat and Plant Eaters                      Lesson 6: The Dinosaur's Life Cycle                      Lesson 7: Nature and Change                                    (3) an annotated bibliography and list of teacher reference/resource                  materials.                                                                                   Teacher            Guide for Britannica.com's Discovering Dinosaurs Activity Guide.             Here you can find the teachers guide to a well done activity guide that            includes four activities which are suggested for use in schools or by            students and parents at home. The activities are self-guided and promote            critical thinking. They are also interactive, inviting students to locate,            evaluate, and compare sources of information on the Internet. Two of            the student activities on this site are suggested for elementary students            (grades 4-6), two are intended for middle-school students (grades 6-8).            However, you may use any activity at either level, depending on your            curriculum needs and on the abilities of your students. Below are links            to the pages in Britannica.com's activity guide.

This site is maintained            by Celeste Horner, Webmaster (chorner@montana.edu) For a Fall Semester            1998 offering. I have included it here because it contains of wealth            of information about dinosaurs, their classification, relationships            and other references and information that you should check out if you            are seeking information about these exciting creatures.             DINOSAURS            AND THE HISTORY OF LIFE  Purpose and Scope: Dinosaurs are a spectacular            example of a common and highly successful form of life, dominant for            135,000,000 years and still with us today. The course focuses on using            dinosaurs to show how the Earth and its life functions, and how scientists            learn how the world works. We will use a paleoecological systems approach,            and hence the course is a basic introduction to Earth Systems in general.            The lab is a ""hands-on"" introduction to paleobiology and historical            aspects of Earth System study. The main question that we focus on is,            ""What can dinosaurs tell us about the way the world works?"". This page            has a link to the online Syllabus which is a nice set of lecture notes            (a little slow loading) that you may find useful.             Dinosaur World .            Texas A&M University Department of Geology & Geophysics , Geol. 307.            Dinosaur World is a Tier II core curriculum course in Science that uses            dinosaur evolution and paleoecology to investigate how geological and            biological processes interact to shape the history of life on earth.            Large land reptiles appeared and flourished during the Mesozoic, a time            of warm 'greenhouse' climate, when the present-day continents were gathered            into super-continents. The class will discuss the unique problems of            dinosaur paleobiology, including the morphological constraints imposed            by gigantism, the controversy about dinosaur metabolism, and the evolutionary            relationships of dinosaurs to modern and ancient vertebrates. Finally,            the class will evaluate the cause of dinosaur extinction at the end            of the Mesozoic, and ponder the implications of the Cretaceous/Tertiary            mass extinction for organisms living today.

The Dinosaur Mailing            List FAQs - A Career in Paleontology . The Dinosaur Mailing List            receives numerous requests for advice on how to become a paleontologist            and which colleges offer programs in paleontology. Rather than have            potential paleos write to the list and list members recreate answers            with each new inquiry, the authors of this page hope that what has been            assembled here will simplify the process for potential paleontologists            seeking information on pursuing such a career.

DINO RUSS 8-29-00         Draw T. rex ,        Stephen F. Greb, Kentucky Geological Survey, Grade: 4 and up,  Core content :        Fossils are evidence of past life.  Objectives and summary  In this        activity, students learn how scientists determine what prehistoric animals        looked like based on their bones. The activity reinforces the concept that        fossils are mostly the remains of hard parts of ancient life and integrates        paleontology with biology. The instructor and students will use the appearance        of modern animals to reconstruct what an ancient animal, a Tyrannosaurus        rex (T. rex), may have looked like when it was living. The instructor will        draw the T. rex on a chalkboard over a projected image of a T. rex skull.        You do not need to be an artist to do this activity. Students follow along        on their own worksheets. What they will see on the chalkboard is the projected        image. At the end of the activity, when the projected image is turned off,        all that is left is a drawing of the mighty T. rex!         Jurassic Park Institute  is a        new educationally-focused program dedicated to dinosaur science. Its goal:        to reach out to children around the world and encourage study and learning        about dinosaurs. Funded by Universal Studios and director Steven Spielberg's        Amblin Entertainment, the Institute's dedicated web site ( www.jpinstitute.com )        was launched in July 2001, along with the release of the feature film  Jurassic        Park III.  The Jurassic Park Institute web site will be a resource for        dinosaur learning and fun for individual and classroom use.       Learning and Fun        With Dinosaurs . What's that?

The            Glen Rose Trackway  is a series of fossilized dinosaur footprints            left some 107 million years ago at the edge of a lagoon. Excavated from            the bed of the Paluxy River, near the town of Glen Rose in central Texas,            the trackway gives a picture of dinosaurs that in some ways is more            striking than that offered by fossils.             Dinosaur            embryo . Since 1990 scientists from the American Museum of Natural            History and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences have been collaborating            on an ongoing expedition to Mongolia, one of the world's richest sites            of excellently preserved dinosaur fossils. In 1993 at a site called            Ukhaa Tolgod (""brown hills""), members of the expedition discovered one            of the most important finds that Mongolia has yielded -- an egg containing            the fossilized embryo of a theropod dinosaur, thought to be 70 to 80            million years old. Dinosaur eggs were found in the Gobi Desert by the            Museum's Central Asiatic Expedition of the 1920s, but none of them contained            embryos. This is the first such complete and informative example to            be discovered there, as well as the first embryo of a meat-eating dinosaur            to be found anywhere in the world. Studying the fossilized embryo, scientists            identified it as an unhatched oviraptorid, a dinosaur whose long neck            and long hind legs resembled those of an ostrich, while its skull looked            like that of a parrot.           Tyrannosaurus .            Almost everything about this dinosaur -- the four-foot-long jaw, the            six-inch-long teeth, and the huge thigh bones -- bespeaks the enormous            power of Tyrannosaurus rex, the largest theropod (or meat-eating dinosaur)            that ever existed. Most of the bones here are real, fossilized Tyrannosaurus            bones. They are from two specimens discovered in Montana by Museum paleontologist            Barnum Brown in 1902 and 1908. These 65-million-year-old bones were            once arranged so that the dinosaur stood upright, propped on its tail.            Based on new research, however, Museum scientists determined that it            was more accurate to show Tyrannosaurus rex mounted on two feet, in            a stalking position, with its head low, tail extended, and one foot            slightly raised. The dinosaur in this position is equally if not more            terrifying than before, with implications of speed added to its obvious            strength and size.

The Dinosauria: Truth is Stranger than Fiction Dinosaurs            occupy a vaunted niche in the public mind; the very word conjures up            images of gargantuan, now-defunct beasts that ruled the Earth long ago.            What is the truth about dinosaurs that underlies the popular awe and            mystique that shrouds them? What does modern science have to say about            the dinosaurs? Dinosaurs are animals that evolved into many sizes and            shapes and were and are quite diverse, and this group of animals with            widely different modes of living lived from late in the Triassic period            (about 225 million years ago) until the end of the Mesozoic era (about            65 million years ago); but actually they live on today as the birds.                           DISPELLING DINOSAUR MYTHS: The term ""dinosaur"" has had                a long history of misrepresentation.                                   Not everything big and dead is a dinosaur.                   Not all dinosaurs lived at the same time.                    Dinosaurs are not extinct. Technically - based on features                    of the skeleton, most dinosaur experts consider birds to be                    dinosaurs.

This alphabetized listcomprises all dinosaur generic        names based on skeletal material known to have been published anywhere,        with or without formal scientific descriptions. Names printed in bold italics        are scientifically valid; other names are vernacular, preoccupied, or otherwise        scientifically invalid. Occasionally it is found that two different names        have been given to the same genus. Such names are known as synonyms, and        instances of synonymy are annotated in the List (see Synonymies in List        section below). Being a synonym by no means invalidates a generic name,        since the junior synonym is usually available in case a synonymy is refuted.The        names appear in this List without regard to their validity or synonymy,        but each name is associated in some way, formally or informally, with real        fossil material. Names of dinosaur footprint and egg genera, however, or        of fictional, fictitious, or fraudulent dinosaurs, are not included. Published        Japanese common names, usually ending in “-ryu,” are not included        unless they have been Latinized elsewhere in print. Also not included are        names that have appeared solely on the Internet, or in e-mails, in advance        of publication (there are usually four or five such floating around at any        particular time).

They conclude that,        despite 66 million years of extinction, dinosaurs continue to change as        we do, because they exist as much in our science and imagination as they        do deep within the ground, in scattered fossil remnants. And, as science        marches on, the debate continues to this day about what we mean when we        say ""dinosaur."" Are they related to birds or reptiles? Killed        off by asteroids or disease? Warm-blooded or cold-blooded?         Howell's Dinosaur Learning        Center .

Interdisciplinary information,        Interactive Activities and Additional Web Sites       Ischigualasto - Triassic        Park . The objectives of this research project are the discovery and        extraction of vertebrate fossils, and fossil plants when found, and the        stratigraphic and tectonic analysis of the sediments in which they are found.        Fossils from Ischigualasto are significant due to their temporal position        at the beginning of the Mesozoic archosaur radiation. Results of discoveries        made in Ischigualasto are applied to the history and interpretation of life        and to the geological definition of continental Triassic stratigraphy. Motivated        volunteers can contribute greatly in the prospecting and extraction of fossils.        Volunteer assignments will be the same as those of the professional staff.

As a result I am putting some of the significant links that        have information on some of these finds:                                                Sauropod Eggs From Pantagonia, Argentina . Below are links to sites            about an exciting site in Argentina where thousands of sauropod eggs            have been found as well as a number of dinosaur embryos (and some hatchlings)            with fossilized skin impressions.                                            First                Dinosaur Embryos Found With Fossilized Skin . An exhibition at                the American Museum of Natural History, December 17, 1999 to May                1, 2000. In November 1997, Dr. Luis Chiappe and Dr. Lowell Dingus                went to Patagonia with an expedition team and discovered a nesting                site that contained thousands of dinosaur eggs, including fossilized                embryos and fossilized skin. Sauropods, a type of plant-eating dinosaur,                not only gathered in this area of Patagonia to lay their eggs, but                returned there for numerous seasons. .

Our team set up this web site to correspond                to the Tiniest Giants museum exhibit and provide additional information                and resources to you about this amazing and fun discovery. The exhibit                and this site are a joint project of the Natural History Museum                of Los Angeles County and the Carmen Funes Museum in Neuquen, Argentina.                Our team discovered the first ever sauropod eggs with babies still                inside. Sauropods are a group of giant, long-necked, plant-eating                dinosaurs. This discovery showed that tiny hatchlings can grow to                be the largest dinosaurs.

The Monash            University has a on-line paleo site where you can learn about its 'Dinosaur            Dreaming' expeditions. Dinosaur Dreaming is part of a successful project            between Museum Victoria and Monash University, the Dinosaur Dreaming            fossil excavations at Inverloch over the last 12 years have yielded            not only fascinating insights to the life and times of Australia’s            Dinosaurs, but also highly significant and intriguing fossil mammals.            Inverloch: Home of Dinosaur Dreaming is the Victorian coastal town near            which the Dinosaur Dreaming site is located. About 145 kilometres (ninety            minutes drive) from Melbourne, Inverloch is a very civilised place from            which to do field research.The site is a rocky shore platform called            Flat Rocks, about five minutes' drive from the township on a stretch            of coast favoured by surfers and fishing enthusiasts. This is where            the Cretaceous mammal, Ausktribosphenos nyktos, was found in March 1997.                                         Colorado                    Dinosaur Depot            features exhibits  that explore the very rich fossil heritage of            the Cañon City area. Initially the focus was on the Garden Park            Fossil Area, 12 miles north of Cañon City on the historic Shelf            Road to Cripple Creek, Colorado. The Garden Park Fossil Area has produced            world-class, late Jurassic dinosaur fossils for over 125 years. While            the area is known worldwide for its dinosaur fossils, other types of            fossils have been located that help our understanding of the Jurassic            environment. More recently, dinosaur fossils have been found in other            areas around Cañon City.                           Skyline Drive                Trackway Site . In December 1999 a Cañon City resident                studying paleontology at the University of Denver brought to our                attention the presence of dinosaur tracks on Skyline Drive. Skyline                Drive travels along the top of the Dakota Formation hogback just                to the west of Cañon City. Volunteers from the Dinosaur Depot                developed the site during 2000 and 2001. One of the tracks can be                seen on exhibit in the Dinosaur Depot. A guide brochure for the                Skyline Drive Trackway Site is available in the Dinosaur Gift Shop.

Paleontologists Russ Jacobson and Joe Devera        of the ISGS have been involved in ongoing field studies to examine potential        sites in the Cretaceous of southern and western Illinois. This page will        be an ""ongoing report"" of a work in progress by these scientists and others        they are collaborating with.                Sinofossa Institute  is        dedicated to the understanding of past. They provide knowledge of Chinese        vertebrate past (dinosaurs as well as associated vertebrates) past both        online and in the field. Supported by its world-leading academics as well        as field experience in the study of fossils in both China and North America,        Sinofossa Institute is unique in its strong emphasis on the scientific,        educational, and cultural appeal of fossils, especially dinosaurs. Sinofossa        Institute serves people in two ways: by its expeditions, which provide participants        the unique experiences on Chinese cultural, historical, and geological wonders,        and by its online information services, which provide reliable and valuable        sources on news and views about natural history of China. Sinofossa Institute        was incorporated in Montreal, Canada in 2003. It was founded by professional        paleontologist Dr. Hailu You (Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania, 2002).        Dr. You has 15 years of experience in the discovery and study of dinosaurs        from both China and North America.  Why Are China's Dinosaurs Important?         In recent years, China has produced some of the most exceptional paleontological        discoveries ever made, including stunning dinosaur fossils preserving soft        tissues such as feathers, skin, and internal organs. These discoveries have        provided unprecedented insight into the evolution of these remarkable animals        and their world. In particular, several landmark Chinese fossils have firmly        established that birds are living dinosaurs China has proven to be one of        the most productive areas for new discoveries. Dinosaurs from China are        often bizarre, even by dinosaur standards. They include long-necked plant-eaters        with clubs on their tails; tiny, tree-dwelling predators covered in feathers;        fearsome, giant carnivores with long crests on their skulls; and tall, long-necked,        plant-eaters with short legs and enormous arms. Many of these exciting new        discoveries have inspired paleontologists to rethink formerly accepted ideas        about dinosaurs and the world they lived in..                   Expeditions .            Sinofossa's expeditions are small-grouped, professional-led, and educational-highlighted            journeys on cultural, historical, and geological wonders of China. Currently,            Sinofossa's expeditions unite volunteers with professional paleontologists            to discover and excavate fossils (especial dinosaurs) at some of the            most spectacular fossil sites in China. Participating scientists gain            valuable support in data collection, while volunteers are rewarded with            unique educational, cultural, and personal experiences. Our expeditions            provide an opportunity for anyone, regardless of their scientific background,            to make a lasting contribution to the understanding of our past.

Nearly 100% complete skeleton (Burnham et al, 1999). Remarkably similar        to Archaeopteryx. Largest brain-size of any known dinosaur. Researchers        have unveiled what may be the most convincing evolutionary link yet between        dinosaurs and birds: a 75-million-year-old creature with a roadrunner's        body, arms that resembled clawed wings and hair-like feathers. They call        it Bambiraptor feinbergi. The first recovered skeleton of the species was        shown Thursday by the Florida Institute of Paleontology. It is not clear        whether the creature could fly, but experts said that anatomically it is        the most birdlike dinosaur yet discovered. They said the finding advances        the increasingly popular theory that birds evolved from dinosaurs.       Dinobird .        A new dinosaur specimen unearthed in the Liaoning Province of the China        demonstrates exceptional preservation of integumentary structures akin to        primitive feathers.Theropod dinosaurs with feather-like structures have        been found from deposits roughly 130 million years ago during the Late Jurassic,        however none have been as well preserved as this new specimen from the Yixian        Formation. The entire skeleton is preserved on two counter slabs, in a pose        much like that of its close relative the oldest bird (Archaeopteryx lithographica)        from the Jurassic of Germany. It's sub-adult state, complicates identification.        It either is a juvenile specimen of Sinornithosaurus or new genus. However,        it undoubtedly belongs to the family Dromaeosauridae, which also includes        Velociraptor. A full description of the specimen can be found in the next        issue of Nature.

It has webbed feet                   and wings that look like flippers. It uses its wing                   flippers for underwater swimming. Many penguins                   live in the icy waters in or near Antarctica.                                                                                 Harder  - Penguins                   are a type of flightless bird that spends most of                   its life in the sea. They seldom visit land except                   to raise their young. Penguins have short legs and                   tall, torpedo-shaped bodies. On land they are able                   to stand upright, and because of their stature,                   they walk with a waddle. They may appear awkward,                   but penguins actually walk about as fast as people.                   They also climb rocky shores by hopping from rock                   to rock. Some penguins travel over ice and snow by                   'tobogganing' - - sliding on their bellies. But                   penguins travel best by swimming, hour after hour.                   Penguins swim below the surface, and they leap                   above the surface for a quick breath of air. They                   also dive much deeper than any other bird. Some                   species are able to reach nearly 900 feet (275                   meters) below the surface. Those deep divers can                   hold their breath for up to 20 minutes.                                                                                 There are 17 species of penguins, ranging in                   size from the largest emperor penguin to the                   diminutive fairy penguin. The emperor penguin can                   grow to almost 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall and may                   weigh up to 100 pounds (45 kilograms). The fairy                   penguin, also called the little penguin, stands                   about 1 foot (30 centimeters) tall and usually                   weighs about 11/2 pounds (3.3 kilograms).                                                                                 Penguins will not cross warm ocean water;                   therefore, they are all found in nature south of                   the equator. The Galapagos penguin lives the                   farthest north, near the equator in the cold waters                   around the islands of the same name. Eight other                   species of penguins make their home among the                   islands near New Zealand and Australia. Three                   species inhabit the coast of South America, and one                   type lives near southern Africa. Six species live                   far to the south, in the icy waters near                   Antarctica.                                                                                                                                                                  Focus                   on Penguins   from  Monterey Bay                   Aquarium                                        http://www.mbayaq.org/efc/efc_fo/fo_penguins.asp                                        Meet the exhibit's penguins, read about life at                   sea, or check out the  Penguin                   Cam .

Lepidoptera, which includes both butterflies and moths, comprises at least 125,000 known species including 12,000 in America north of Mexico. These enchanting insects have 4 membranous wings covered with delicate pigmented or prismatic scales. Butterflies generally fly during the day, while most moths are nocturnal.   --Table of   Contents--            Polyphemus Moth Antheraea polyphemus  Polyphemus Moth Caterpillar   Snowberry Clearwing Moth Hemaris diffinis Hummingbird Clearwing Moth Hemaris thysbe  Yellow-collared Scape Moth Cisseps fulvicollis           Himmelman's Plume Moth Geina tenuidactyla False Crocus Geometer Moth Xanthotype urticaria            Forage Looper Moth  Caenurgina erechtea Corn Earworm Moth Heliothis zea              Celery Looper Moth  Anagrapha falcifera  Leaf Roller Moth Epiblema sp. Orange-spotted Pyrausta Moth     Delicate Cycnia Moth,  Cycnia tenera , a diurnal moth                             Moth larvae are commonly called caterpillars. The pupal case is commonly called a cocoon (vs. chrysalis in butterflies). There are approximately 13,000 described species in about 70 families in North America (plus many more undescribed species of mostly micromoths), and about 165,000 species worldwide. Adults have feathery, thickened, or threadlike antennae (not knobbed or hooked, as in butterflies and skippers), and most species are active at night. At rest, many species hold their wings out horizontally, or hugged over/around the abdomen. Larvae (caterpillars) have a hardened head capsule and a fleshy body composed of a thorax bearing three pairs of legs, and an elongated cylindrical abdomen bearing from zero to five pairs of prolegs (short fleshy ventral projections used for clinging or walking). The body may be either uniformly colored or patterned with stripes, bands, or spots; the surface may be smooth, or may be sparsely or densely covered with short or long hairs, tufts of hair, spines, knobs, or other features.

The caterpillar of the  gypsy moth  ( Lymantria dispar ) causes severe damage to forests in the northeast United States, where it is an  invasive species . In temperate climates, the  codling moth  causes extensive damage, especially to fruit farms. In tropical and subtropical climates, the  diamondback moth  ( Plutella xylostella ) is perhaps the most serious pest of  brassicaceous  crops.     Several moths in the family  Tineidae  are commonly regarded as pests because their larvae eat  fabric  such as  clothes  and  blankets  made from natural proteinaceous fibers such as  wool  or  silk . They are less likely to eat mixed materials containing artificial fibers. There are some reports that they can be repelled by the scent of wood from  juniper  and  cedar , by lavender, or by other natural oils. However, many consider this unlikely to prevent infestation.  Naphthalene  (the chemical used in  mothballs ) is considered more effective, but there are concerns over its effects on human health. Moth larvae may be killed by freezing the items which they infest for several days at a temperature below 18F (-7.7C).  [1]     Moths are sturdy and usually are more resistant to pesticides than are    mosquitos and flies.                                                   Some moths are  farmed . The most notable of these is the  silkworm , the larva of the domesticated moth  Bombyx mori . It is farmed for the silk with which it builds its  cocoon . The silk industry produces over 130 million kilograms of raw silk, worth about 250 million  U.S. dollars , each year. Not all silk is produced by  Bombyx mori . There are several species of  Saturniidae  that are also farmed for their silk, such as the Ailanthus moth ( Samia cynthia  group of species), the Chinese Oak Silkmoth ( Antheraea pernyi ), the Assam Silkmoth ( Antheraea assamensis ), and the Japanese Silk Moth ( Antheraea yamamai ).

clueweb09-en0001-44-01657	"          BUG OF THE MONTH: June 1997     Indian Meal Moth     Plodia interpunctella   Order Lepidoptera, Family Pyralidae          Copyright © 1997 by   Louise      Kulzer     This article originally appeared in Scarabogram, June 1997, New Series      No. 206, pp. 2-3.          Well, well. Now I know who you are! I beg your indulgence, kind reader, but    after years of cohabitation, I've finally learned the identity of my kitchen    nemesis, the Indian meal moth.                            Plodia interpunctella , adults (wingspan 16 mm) and pupa         Our tale began almost a decade ago, when my boys were still small and delightful    (at least in retrospect). The tiny gray-brown moths began fluttering around    my kitchen one day shortly after a trip to my local natural food cooperative.    The adults are small, the two-toned front wings divided by a thin irregular    line. When the wings are folded at rest, the lighter color is closer the head,    the darker color below.    It was the beginning of our acquaintance, and I fear there shall never be an    end. For the first half-decade, I didn't care what the name of those unholy    flutterers was. I just concentrated on getting rid of them.   I suspected they must eat grain products, so I'd go through my pantry, one    drawer a week, looking for them. Every so often I'd hit it big. I'd find a cereal    box, or a bag of wheat germ that exhibited their tell-tale webbing and the small,    dirty white larvae. I'd wrap the infested food in several layers of plastic    and dump it in the garbage, content to have Cedar Hills deal with the little    buggers rather than me.                            Plodia interpunctella  larva        and pattern of ""crochet hooks"" on proleg         I was especially concerned when the adults were flying. They have a disconcerting    weak, flimsy flight, highly erratic. Despite their seeming frailness, I could    seldom catch them. My husband preferred a fly swatter, but he invariably managed    to deface the few items of decoration I had set about the kitchen walls. I preferred    a two-hand clap, closing in on the moth as it feebly fluttered in the kitchen    air. However, most of the time, just as I was about to clap a fatal blow, it    fluttered helplessly off in a different direction, its life temporarily spared,    repeatedly. Helpless indeed.    I renewed my hunting for larvae more diligently when the adults flew, reminded    by them of my lack of good domestic larder management. When they were out of    my face, it didn't matter so much. However, as this dragged on, cycle after    cycle over the years, I got fairly compulsive about going through everything    in less time so that they would have no pantry habitat left.    I found them in absolutely ridiculous places. Once I found a robust colony    of hundreds of larvae in a small bag of Morton's salt I used for canning pickles.    Salt. Now, I'm no chemistry whiz, but the last time I looked, that was a sodium    atom in combination with a chloride atom. Now how on earth could that be food    to a bug? There isn't a carbon atom to be had in the whole bag, nor is the breakdown    product likely to ever produce a carbon atom. So where did I get the idea food    had to have carbon in it?   Another time I found them in a Spice Island spice can. I believe the spice    was curry, but I can't be certain any more. At least curry has carbon atoms.    Some other big finds come to mind, like the 5 pound bag of bird seed. Or the    tupperware container I used to store popcorn kernels (before popping). Or the    bag of Niko-niko brand rice. Cereal boxes, cake mixes, the binding of my cookbook,    the rose petals I was drying for potpourri; the list goes on. Sometimes I found    them just quietly binge-ing away right on my shelves in the corners where residue    builds up. I was repulsed. I washed the shelves, using a knife to scrape every    last bit of residue out of the corners. Just for the record, I don't use poisons.    It's against my philosophy of life. Rather, I embrace long suffering.   I found out quite a lot about the life-style of my moth cohabitants over the    years. I found that the larvae have an urge to disperse upward before they pupate.    They especially like corners. I can usually tell how we're doing by looking    at the ceiling to see how many pupae there are. I also learned that if the larvae    don't get much to eat, they can go through their life cycle anyway. The adults    are just smaller. Normally, the adult moths are a whopping 1 cm, but I've had    adults half that big. You gotta wonder.   There have been long periods - months on end - without moths. Times I've hoped    I finally had the upper hand. But they've always rematerialized. Including as    I speak. But wait. These recent moths are not two-toned. They are uniformly    dingy. The trailing edge of the wing is ragged, not nicely scalloped like the    Indian meal moth! That means another species as well. Lucky me, diversity to    my long-suffering. Now I don't even know what behavior belongs to what moth!    Luckily I haven't been able to eradicate them. There is still opportunity for    a few experiments in the kitchen, and another article next year. Vive la science!   Note: According to literature I found, the Indian meal moth is supposed to    be a pest of stored grain, nuts and raisins. I guess popcorn, rice, cereal and    bird seed could all generally fit under ""grain,"" but no one said anything    about salt! Guess you gotta take research with a grain of it.   [Here's some general info from the Handbook of Pest Control: A native of the    Old World, the species is a very general feeder, and is recorded infesting chocolate,    dog food, and red pepper besides the more usual grain and fruit products. No    mention of salt, however. One entomologist wrote ""my own residence ...literally    swarms with adults, despite the fact I have been unable to find any infested    food supply."" He should have tried salt! The species overwinters as larvae,    which pupate in March and emerge in April. The female, living up to 18 days,    lays 200-400 eggs. The larval stage varies a lot with temperature and food,    and lasts 13 to 288 days. The larvae are susceptible to the bacterial insecticide    BT (as used on gypsy moths!) and to a wasp parasite,  Bracon hebetor .    There is an ""excellent"" pheromone trap available for adults.

The name is derived from Greek words for scale, ""lepido"", and    wing, ""ptera"", and refers to the scales covering the wings in    all butterflies and moths.                                                  Some butterflies are called ""skippers"" because of their rapid    skipping from flower to flower.   Some moths have been called    ""millers"" because their wings appear to be covered with dust,    as the clothes of a person who mills grain.   Many common    names are used for different groups and species of Lepidoptera,    such as swallowtails, hairstreak butterflies, silk moths, and    owlets.  Some Lepidoptera names refer to forms of the    caterpillars (for example, woolly bears, cutworms, hornworms,    and inchworms).                                          Diversity                                                 More than 165,000 species of moths and butterflies have been    named in the world, and more than 11,400 occur in North    America.   The butterflies include about 17,550 species in the    world and 754 species in North America.    Of the North American    moths, more than half of the species are microlepidoptera,    which include many of the small sized moths.   About 5,000    species are larger moths, or macrolepidoptera.   More than    2,900 of the larger moths are members of the family Noctuidae,    which includes the cutworms and owlet moths.                                            Habitats                                Lepidoptera occur almost anywhere that plants grow, although    not all eat plants.  Some species live on mountains at high    altitudes where temperatures are too cold to fly at night.      At high altitudes, both butterflies and moths often are    adapted to fly during the warmer daytime.   Some species occur    only in tropical rain forests, prairies, bogs, and other    specialized habitats.  Some caterpillars can live in water,    feeding on aquatic plants.    Several species have become    adapted to living in houses of people.                                      Form and Function                                                           Most Lepidoptera have a long and coiled proboscis for sucking    liquid food.  A few primitive moths have mandibles for chewing    instead of a proboscis.   Giant silk moths have a small    proboscis that does not suck liquids, and the adult never feeds.                                                            The antennae in butterflies are knobbed or enlarged at the    ends, whereas in moths, they are thread-like or feathery.      Butterflies are usually brightly colored, whereas most moths    have black, brown and other dull colors.  However, some moths    that fly during the day time resemble butterflies in having    bright colors.                                                         The wings of moths span from less than one-tenth inch to    more than 12 inches. The largest butterfly, the Queen Alexandra    butterfly ( Ornithoptera alexandrae )of New Guinea, has a wingspan of 11 inches.     Most moths hold their wings tent-like over their bodies when    at rest.   Females of some moths, like the cankerworms and    bagworms, do not have wings.  The gypsy moth female has large    wings, but its large abdomen prevents it from flying.                                                          Scales are flat and hollow hairs that cover the wings and    bodies of Lepidoptera.  These scales are filled with substances,    which are known as pigments, that make many different colors.     In addition to the colors that are visible to humans, some    Lepidoptera have an ultraviolet color that is visible to the    insect but not to humans.  Many scales of the same color can    be grouped together to form patterns on the wings.  Lepidoptera    that fly during the day time use these color patterns for    communication.                                      In some Lepidoptera, scales have a form that reflects and    scatters the light like a rainbow or a soap bubble.    In the    morpho butterfly, the color pigment of the wing is brown, which    can be seen when viewed at an angle.  If the angle of view is    changed, a bright blue color is reflected and seen.   This    reflection of light to form a color different from the pigment    is called iridescence.  Iridescent colors are present in many    moths and butterflies, especially tropical species.      Photographs of morpho butterflies and other tropical species    can be found at   Chuck's Butterfly Page .                                                       The colors and patterns of wings also are important for    defense against predators.   Some moths have spots on their    wings that appear to be eyes of an owl or other large animal.      If a moth with eye-spots is threatened by a bird, it can flash    its wings to scare away this predator.   Some butterflies have    color patterns that resemble heads at the tips of their wings.     If the predator strikes at this false head, the butterfly is    able to escape more easily.                                                           Many Lepidoptera use color and pattern as a disguise, or    camouflage, to blend in with the background.   Some moths and    butterflies resemble dead leaves.  Many moths, which rest    during the daytime, are disguised as twigs, tree bark, lichens,    or bird droppings.                                     The bodies of some butterflies are full of distasteful    chemicals that larvae obtain from plants. These butterflies    advertise their bad taste by having wings with warning colors.    The distasteful monarch butterfly has orange and black wings    to warn predators.  Red, yellow, and white also are used as    warning colors.   Some species do not have distasteful chemicals,    but they obtain protection by being an imitation, or mimic, of    a distasteful species.   The viceroy butterfly does not have    distasteful chemicals, but it is protected from predation by    being a mimic of the monarch.                                                      Caterpillars have chewing mouthparts and very short antennae.     They do not have compound eyes, but they usually have six    simple eyes on each side of their heads.  Caterpillars usually    have three pair of legs on the thorax, four pairs near the    middle of their abdomens, and one pair at the end of their    abdomens.   The five pairs of stump-like legs on the abdomen    are called prolegs because they are not segmented like the    true legs on the thorax.  The ends of the prolegs have tiny    hooks to help in holding onto a surface.                                                           Caterpillars are slow moving and are often exposed to predators.      The colors of many caterpillars blend with their backgrounds,    which makes the caterpillars difficult to see.  Caterpillars    often have eye-spots, even some that appear to blink when the    caterpillar moves.   Other caterpillars resemble twigs, pieces    of bark, and leaves that have been partly eaten.  Some    geometer caterpillars cover their bodies with pieces of leaves    or flowers on which they are eating.                                                          Caterpillars known as bagworms and casebearers live inside a    protective bag or case.  The caterpillar makes this portable    house from silk and pieces of the plant on which it is feeding.      As the caterpillar grows, it continually adds more silk and    plant parts to the open end of its case.                                                           Some caterpillars are protected by ""stinging"" hairs and spines.     These hairs and spines can break off or penetrate the skin to    cause a stinging sensation.  Common stinging caterpillars in    North America include the saddleback caterpillar and related    slug caterpillars, puss caterpillar, and caterpillars of the    io moth and buck moth.                                           Life Cycle                                                           Lepidoptera have complete metamorphosis with egg, larva, pupa,    and adult.   After hatching from the egg, the caterpillar may    feed for a few weeks or even a couple of years.   Caterpillars    of butterflies usually molt their skin four times before    becoming a pupa.   Caterpillars of moths have from three to    nine molts, but five molts is most common.    Depending on the    species, the larval stage may last from a few weeks to a few    years.                                                        Mature caterpillars of some moths spin silken cocoons in which    to pupate.   Caterpillars of many moths burrow into the ground    to pupate without a cocoon.  A butterfly caterpillar does not    spin a cocoon or burrow into the ground, and its bare pupa is    called a chrysalis.    The pupal stage can last for a few    weeks up to several months.  Many species spend the winter as    a pupa.                                     Most butterflies and moths have short adult lives.   Some    species do not feed; they only live long enough to mate and    lay eggs.  Other species can live for several weeks, and even    pass the winter in the adult stage.                                       Form and Feeding Habits                                                         Most adult Lepidoptera have a proboscis to suck nectar and    water.  Lepidoptera also need salt in their diet.   One way    they obtain salt is by sucking water from mud puddles.  A few    moths feed on secretions from the eyes and noses of animals.     Some tropical moths have a proboscis that can pierce a fruit    to feed on the juice, and some can pierce the skin of an animal    to feed on blood.  Many moths and butterflies feed on decaying    organic matter, such as dead animals and animal droppings.                                  Most caterpillars feed on different kinds of plants.   Many    species prefer particular parts of plants--leaves, stems,    roots, flowers, fruit, or seeds.  Some species will feed on    dead or decaying plants.  Ferns, mosses, fungi, and algae are    also hosts for some Lepidoptera.                                                   Caterpillars of some yucca moths feed on seeds of the yucca    plant.  The females of these yucca moths have special    mouthparts for gathering pollen and pollinating the flower.      Without this pollination by the female moth, her offspring    would not have seeds on which to feed.                                     A few caterpillars feed on animal products.   The family    Tineidae includes some species with caterpillars that can eat    hair, feathers, and even horns of animals.   Clothes moths are    pests of wool clothing.                                Several kinds of caterpillars are predaceous and feed on scale    insects and other Homoptera.   Caterpillars of some butterflies    (family Lycaenidae) will feed on honeydew of Homoptera as well    as food passed by the mouths of tending ants.   Some of these    caterpillars trick the ants into carrying them to their nest    in the ground.  Once in the ant nest, the caterpillar eats the    ants' young.                                                      Most caterpillars that are seen by people are those that feed    on the outer parts of the plants.    Leaf mining caterpillars    feed inside leaves, leaving their feeding tracks, or mines, as    visible evidence of their presence.  Some Lepidoptera make galls    on plants, and others live in galls made by other insects.      Many caterpillars are hidden because they feed in rolled leaves    or between leaves that are tied with silk.   Some caterpillars    bore in stems and tree trunks and are seen rarely.                                             Natural Enemies                                                         Insects are the main predators of Lepidoptera eggs and young    larvae.   Birds are probably more important predators of older    and larger larvae.  Caterpillars compose more than 70% of the    food of some birds.  Many small mammals feed on caterpillars    and pupae, and bats eat many moths.   Eggs and larvae often    are parasitized by Diptera (family Tachinidae) and Hymenoptera    (families Braconidae, Ichneumonidae, and others).                                   Caterpillars are often killed by diseases.  The most common    diseases are caused by bacteria and viruses.   In recent years,    bacteria and viruses have been made into insecticides to kill    pest species.                                         Olympic Feats and Other Strange Facts                                   Moths were the first to invent a kind of velcro, which is used    to stick two surfaces together.  Many moths have a patch of    hooked spines on the front wing that locks with a similar    patch on top of the third segment of the thorax.  When at rest,    the moth locks the front wing and thorax together with this    natural velcro.                               There are almost twice as many species of butterflies in the    world as there are birds.                                                      The monarch butterfly in North America migrates to two main    locations every fall to pass the winter.  Monarchs that live    west of the Rocky Mountains migrate to the California coast.     Monarchs living east of the Rocky Mountains migrate to mountains    in Mexico.  Some monarchs fly as far as 1,500 miles.   In the    spring the monarchs in Mexico return northward to find milkweed    plants on which to lay eggs.   Only the offspring from the    over-wintering adults will eventually return to the northern    United States and Canada.  More information on the monarch and    its migration can be found at   Project Monarch Butterfly     and  Monarch Watch .                                      Butterflies in the family Nymphalidae use only four legs.     The first pair of legs are very small and brush-like.                                 Species of  Exyra  (family Noctuidae) live in and eat    carnivorous pitcher plants, which capture and digest other    insects.                               The largest moths in the world are the Atlas moths, which    include species that have wings with the greatest surface    area of any insect.  The great owlet,  Thysania agrippina ,    has the greatest wingspan among moths with narrow wings that    extend more than 12 inches.                               Hearing organs are present on the front wings, abdomen, and    thorax in different moths.    Some caterpillars can hear sound    with the hairs on their bodies.                               The only insect that is not found in the wild is the silkworm,     Bombyx mori , which is kept in cultures by man for    production of silk.                               The first chemical sex attractant ever identified was found in    the silkworm.                               Louis Pasteur was a major researcher on diseases of the    silkworm during the 19th century.  He also invented vaccines    for human diseases and pasteurization, a process used to kill   harmful bacteria in milk and other products that is still used   today.                                A few primitive moths have chewing mouthparts instead of a    sucking proboscis.  Moths in the family Micropterygidae use    their mandibles to feed on pollen of flowers and spores of    ferns.                               Some ghost moths (family Hepialidae) can whistle through their    tongues (proboscis).                               Males of the lesser emperor moth,  Eudia pavonia , can    detect the female's pheromone at a distance of more than six    miles.                               The caterpillar of the polyphemus moth,  Antheraea polyphemus ,    can eat 86,000 times its weight at birth in little less than    two months.                               Some caterpillars can travel to new locations by ""ballooning.""    A silk thread is released by the caterpillar and picked up by    the wind, carrying the caterpillar with it.                               The Mexican jumping bean is a seed that contains the caterpillar    of a moth in the family Tortricidae.  When the bean is    disturbed, the caterpillar moves suddenly to cause the bean to    jump.                               If a bagworm (Psychidae) is hungry, it can eat its own house,    a bag that includes dried bits of its host plant.                               In 1954, J. L. Jorgensen fed female bagworms  Acanthopsyche atra     to European robins.  He found 30-40 eggs were alive and hatched    into larvae after passing through the digestive tract of the    bird.  This gives evidence to one manner in which these moths are    dispersed from one area to another.                                       The Good and The Bad                                                        Lepidoptera include many serious pests of crops and forests in    North America because of the feeding habits of the caterpillars.     Pests of forests include the gypsy moth, tussock moth, tent    caterpillar, spruce budworm, and others.   Fruits are attacked    by the peach tree borer, Oriental fruit moth, codling moth, and    grape berry moth.   Pests of field crops include the European    corn borer, corn earworm, pink bollworm, several species of    armyworms and cutworms, and many others.  Photographs of many    pest species can be found in the       Kansas Department of Agriculture Photo Gallery  .                                      Many moths and butterflies pollinate flowers, although they are    less important than bees in the pollination of crops.    Some    flowers are pollinated mainly by sphinx moths, which have long    tongues for reaching the nectar.  About 10 percent of the trees    in dry forests of Costa Rica are pollinated by sphinx moths.                                                    Lepidoptera are good indicators of environmental quality.   Many    species of Lepidoptera feed only on a single species of plant    in a habitat.   A collection of moths and butterflies can    indicate which plants are present.    A healthy habitat with    five hundred species of plants can have more than 1,500 species    of moths.   Half of this number can be collected in a single    night with light traps that attract moths.   The absence of    some species of Lepidoptera can indicate an unhealthy habitat    even though the host plant may be present.                                   Many kinds of caterpillars make silk with special glands near    their mouths.   Silk that is used by people comes from the    silkworm,  Bombyx mori .   The silkworm has been raised    in captivity for more than 4,500 years.  Originally silk worms    were raised in China, but they are raised now in several Asian    countries.                               Lepidoptera have played an important role in human culture.      The beauty of butterflies and moths have made them favorite    subjects in paintings, glassware, and other art.  Cocoons of    giant silk moths have been used as musical instruments.     American Indians in Arizona and California would gather cocoons,    remove the pupae, and insert pebbles to make cocoon rattles.      Butterfly gardens and houses have become popular attractions at    parks throughout the world.   Many people are now planting    flowers to attract butterflies to their backyard gardens.

The 10,000 living species of  birds  have been  classified  as dinosaurs.   The term ""dinosaur"" was coined in 1842 by  Sir Richard Owen  and derives from  Greek     ( deinos ) ""terrible, powerful, wondrous"" +    ( sauros ) ""lizard"". It is sometimes used informally to describe other  prehistoric reptiles , such as the  pelycosaur   Dimetrodon , the winged  pterosaurs , and the aquatic  ichthyosaurs ,  plesiosaurs  and  mosasaurs , although none of these animals were dinosaurs. Through the first half of the 20th century, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been slow, unintelligent  cold-blooded  animals. Most  research conducted since the 1970s , however, has supported the view that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. The resulting transformation in the scientific understanding of dinosaurs has gradually filtered into popular consciousness.   The 1861 discovery of the primitive bird  Archaeopteryx  first suggested a close relationship between dinosaurs and birds. Aside from the presence of fossilized feather impressions,  Archaeopteryx  was very similar to the contemporary small predatory dinosaur  Compsognathus . Research has since identified  theropod  dinosaurs as the most likely direct ancestors of  birds ; most paleontologists today regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs, and some suggest that dinosaurs and birds should be grouped into one biological class. [ 1 ]  Aside from birds,  crocodilians  are the only other close relatives of dinosaurs to have survived until the present day. Like dinosaurs and birds, crocodilians are members of  Archosauria , a group of  reptiles  that first appeared in the very late  Permian  and came to predominate in the mid-Triassic.   Since the first dinosaur  fossils  were recognized in the early  nineteenth century , mounted dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular. They have been featured in best-selling books and films (notably  Jurassic Park ), and new discoveries are regularly covered by the  media .

[ 2 ]  The term is derived from the  Greek  words  ( deinos  meaning ""terrible"", ""powerful"", or ""wondrous"") and  ( saura  meaning ""lizard"" or ""reptile""). [ 3 ]  Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty. [ 4 ]  In colloquial English ""dinosaur"" is sometimes used to describe an obsolete or unsuccessful thing or person, [ 5 ]  despite the dinosaurs' 160 million year reign and the global abundance and diversity of their descendants, the birds.     Modern definition           Triceratops   skeleton  at the  American Museum of Natural History  in New York City.       Under  phylogenetic taxonomy , dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of "" Triceratops ,  Neornithes  [modern birds], their  most recent common ancestor , and all descendants."" [ 6 ]  It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the most recent common ancestor of  Megalosaurus  and  Iguanodon , because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria. [ 7 ]  Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs, including  theropods  (mostly  bipedal   carnivores ),  sauropodomorphs  (mostly large  herbivorous   quadrupeds  with long necks and tails),  ankylosaurians  (armored herbivorous quadrupeds),  stegosaurians  (plated herbivorous quadrupeds),  ceratopsians  (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), and  ornithopods  (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including ""duck-bills""). These definitions are written to correspond with scientific conceptions of dinosaurs that predate the modern use of phylogenetics. The continuity of meaning is intended to prevent confusion about what the term ""dinosaur"" means.   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict  cladistical  definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor must be included in a group for that group to be natural, birds  are  dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup  Maniraptora , which are  coelurosaurs , which are theropods, which are  saurischians , which are dinosaurs. [ 8 ]   From the point of view of cladistics, birds are dinosaurs, but in ordinary speech the word ""dinosaur"" does not include birds. Additionally, referring to dinosaurs that are not birds as ""non-avian dinosaurs"" is cumbersome. For clarity, this article will use ""dinosaur"" as a synonym for ""non-avian dinosaur"". The term ""non-avian dinosaur"" will be used for emphasis as needed. It is also technically correct to refer to dinosaurs as a distinct group under the older  Linnaean classification  system, which accepts  paraphyletic  taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor.     General description           Stegosaurus  skeleton,  Field Museum ,  Chicago .       Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs (aside from birds) can be generally described as terrestrial  archosaurian   reptiles  with  limbs held erect beneath the body , that existed from the  Late Triassic  (first appearing in the  Carnian   faunal stage ) to the  Late Cretaceous  (going extinct at the end of the  Maastrichtian ). [ 9 ]  Many prehistoric animals are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and  Dimetrodon , but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs. Marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs were neither terrestrial nor archosaurs; pterosaurs were archosaurs but not terrestrial; and  Dimetrodon  was a  Permian  animal more closely related to mammals. [ 10 ]  Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the  Jurassic  and Cretaceous. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded the size of a cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey. [ 11 ]  One notable exception is  Repenomamus giganticus , a  triconodont  weighing between 12 kilograms (26 lb) and 14 kilograms (31 lb) that is known to have eaten small dinosaurs like young  Psittacosaurus . [ 12 ]   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1,850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. [ 13 ]  An earlier study predicted that about 3,400 dinosaur genera existed, including many which would not have been preserved in the fossil record. [ 14 ]  As of September 17, 2008, 1,047 different species of dinosaurs have been named. [ 15 ]  Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds, and others, such as  Ammosaurus  and  Iguanodon , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Many had  bony armor , or cranial modifications like horns and crests. Although known for large size, many dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller. Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including  Antarctica . [ 16 ]  No dinosaurs are known to have lived in marine or aerial habitats, although it is possible some feathered theropods were flyers.     Distinguishing features   While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral  archosaurian  skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common features across a taxonomic group are called  synapomorphies .   Dinosaur synapomorphies include an elongated crest on the  humerus , or upper arm bone, to accommodate the attachment of  deltopectoral  muscles; a shelf at the rear of the  ilium , or main hip bone; a  tibia , or shin bone, featuring a broad lower edge and a flange pointing out and to the rear; and an ascending projection on the  astragalus , one of the ankle bones, which secures it to the tibia. [ 17 ]           Edmontonia  was an ""armored dinosaur"" of the group  Ankylosauria .       A variety of other skeletal features were shared by many dinosaurs. However, because they were either common to other groups of  archosaurs  or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as  diapsid  reptiles, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of  temporal fenestrae  (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the  snout  and lower jaw. [ 18 ]  Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated  scapula , or shoulder blade; a  sacrum  composed of three or more fused  vertebrae  (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in  Herrerasaurus ); [ 17 ]  and an  acetabulum , or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in  Saturnalia , for example). [ 19 ]  Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the Late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature. [ 20 ]          Hip joints and hindlimb postures.       Dinosaurs stood erect in a manner similar to  most modern mammals , but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side. [ 21 ]  Their posture was due to the development of a laterally-facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly-facing distinct head on the femur. [ 22 ]  Their erect posture enabled dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that  surpassed those of ""sprawling"" reptiles . [ 23 ]  Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs. [ 24 ]  Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including  rauisuchians , also had erect limbs but achieved this by a ""pillar erect"" configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the  upper pelvic bone  was rotated to form an overhanging shelf. [ 24 ]     Natural history     Origins and early evolution       Main article:  Evolution of dinosaurs               Eoraptor , an early dinosaur genus.       For a long time many scientists thought dinosaurs were  polyphyletic  with multiple groups of unrelated ""dinosaurs"" evolving due to similar pressures, [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  but dinosaurs are now known to have formed a single group. [ 28 ] [ 17 ]   Dinosaurs diverged from their  archosaur  ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late  Triassic  period, roughly 20 million years after the  Permian-Triassic extinction event  wiped out an estimated 95% of all  life on Earth . [ 29 ] [ 30 ]   Radiometric dating  of the  rock formation  that contained fossils from the early dinosaur  genus   Eoraptor  establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists believe  Eoraptor  resembles the  common ancestor  of all dinosaurs; [ 31 ]  if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal  predators . [ 32 ]  The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like  ornithodirans  such as  Marasuchus  and  Lagerpeton  in  Argentinian   Middle Triassic  strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.   When dinosaurs appeared, terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of basal archosaurs and  therapsids , such as  aetosaurs ,  cynodonts ,  dicynodonts ,  ornithosuchids ,  rauisuchias , and  rhynchosaurs . Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, in one of two events. First, at about the boundary between the  Carnian  and  Norian   faunal stages  (about 215 million years ago), dicynodonts and a variety of basal  archosauromorphs , including the  prolacertiforms  and rhynchosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the  Triassic-Jurassic extinction event  (about 200 million years ago), that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids,  phytosaurs , and rauisuchians. These losses left behind a land fauna of  crocodylomorphs , dinosaurs,  mammals ,  pterosaurians , and  turtles . [ 17 ]   The first few lines of primitive dinosaurs  diversified  through the  Carnian  and  Norian   stages  of the Triassic, most likely by occupying the niches of groups that became extinct. Traditionally, dinosaurs were thought to have  replaced  the variety of other Triassic land animals by proving superior through a long period of competition. This now appears unlikely, for several reasons. Dinosaurs do not show a pattern of steadily increasing in diversity and numbers, as would be predicted if they were competitively replacing other groups; instead, they were very rare through the Carnian, making up only 1-2% of individuals present in  faunas . In the Norian, however, after the extinction of several other groups, they became significant components of faunas, representing 50-90% of individuals. Also, what had been viewed as a key adaptation of dinosaurs, their erect stance, is now known to have present in several contemporaneous groups that were not as successful (aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, rauisuchians, and some groups of crocodylomorphs). Finally, the Late Triassic itself was a time of great upheaval in life, with shifts in plant life, marine life, and climate. [ 17 ]   Crurotarsans , today represented only by crocodilians but in the Late Triassic also encompassing such now-extinct groups as aetosaurs, phytosaurs, ornithosuchians, and rauisuchians, were actually more diverse in the Late Triassic than dinosaurs, indicating that the survival of dinosaurs had more to do with luck than superiority. [ 33 ]     Low diversification in the Cretaceous   Statistical analyses based on raw data suggest that dinosaurs diversified, i.e. the number of species increased, in the Late  Cretaceous . However in July 2008 Graeme T. Lloyd  et al.  argued that this apparent diversification was an illusion caused by  sampling bias , because Late Cretaceous rocks have been very heavily studied. Instead, they wrote, dinosaurs underwent only two significant diversifications in the Late Cretaceous, the initial  radiations  of the  euhadrosaurs  and  ceratopsians . In the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previous been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites  (fossilized dung) indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Meanwhile  herbivorous  insects and  mammals  diversified rapidly to take advantage of the new type of plant food, while lizards, snakes,  crocodilians  and  birds  also diversified at the same time. Lloyd  et al.  suggest that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Classification       Main article:  Dinosaur classification       Dinosaurs (including birds) are  archosaurs , like modern  crocodilians . Archosaurs'  diapsid  skulls have two holes, called  temporal fenestrae , located where the jaw muscles attach, and an additional  antorbital fenestra  in front of the eyes. Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called  synapsids ; and  turtles , with no temporal fenestra, are  anapsids . Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side.   Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a  superorder  or an unranked  clade . They are divided into two  orders ,  Saurischia  and  Ornithischia , depending upon  pelvic  structure. Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with  birds  than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all  taxa  sharing a more recent common ancestor with  Triceratops  than with Saurischia. Saurischians ('lizard-hipped', from the  Greek   sauros  (  ) meaning 'lizard' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') retained the hip structure of their ancestors, with a  pubis  bone directed  cranially , or forward. [ 22 ]  This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups ( Herrerasaurus , [ 35 ]   therizinosauroids , [ 36 ]   dromaeosaurids , [ 37 ]  and  birds [ 8 ] ). Saurischia includes the  theropods  (bipedal and mostly carnivores, except for birds) and  sauropodomorphs  (long-necked quadrupedal  herbivores ).   By contrast, ornithischians ('bird-hipped', from the  Greek   ornitheios  (  ) meaning 'of a bird' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird's pelvis: the  pubis  bone was oriented  caudally  (rear-pointing). Unlike birds, the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward-pointing process. Ornithischia includes a variety of herbivores. ( NB:  the terms ""lizard hip"" and ""bird-hip"" are misnomers  birds evolved from dinosaurs with ""lizard hips"".)

In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass  Pangaea , there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of  coelophysoid   carnivores  and  prosauropod   herbivores . [ 38 ]   Gymnosperm  plants (particularly  conifers ), a potential food source, radiated in the Late Triassic. Prosauropods did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. [ 39 ]  The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of  ceratosaurians ,  spinosauroids , and  carnosaurians , and herbivores consisting of  stegosaurian  ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the  Morrison Formation  of North America and  Tendaguru Beds  of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized  sinraptorid  theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like  Mamenchisaurus . [ 38 ]   Ankylosaurians  and  ornithopods  were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and  pteridophytes  were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential  cheek -like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. [ 39 ]  Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians . [ 8 ]          An Illustration of 18 species of basal ceratopsia to scale.       By the Early Cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians,  iguanodontians , and  brachiosaurids  through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large  spinosaurid  and  carcharodontosaurid  theropods, and  rebbachisaurid  and  titanosaurian  sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia,  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians  like  dromaeosaurids ,  troodontids , and  oviraptorosaurians  became the common theropods, and  ankylosaurids  and early  ceratopsians  like  Psittacosaurus  became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians,  hypsilophodonts , and iguanodontians. [ 38 ]  The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early Late Cretaceous. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of  flowering plants . At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries, taken to its extreme in  hadrosaurids . [ 39 ]  Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid  Nigersaurus . [ 40 ]   There were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were  tyrannosaurids  and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and  pachycephalosaurians . In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting  Gondwana ,  abelisaurids  were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids,  rhabdodontid  iguanodontians,  nodosaurid  ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent. [ 38 ]  Flowering plants were greatly radiating, [ 39 ]  with the first grasses appearing by the end of the Cretaceous. [ 41 ]  Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia. Theropods were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores, with  therizinosaurians  and  ornithomimosaurians  becoming common. [ 39 ]   The  CretaceousTertiary extinction event , which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the birds. Some other  diapsid  groups, such as crocodylians,  lizards ,  snakes ,  sphenodontians , and  choristoderans , also survived the event. [ 42 ]     Paleobiology   Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil records, including  fossilized   bones ,  feces ,  trackways ,  gastroliths ,  feathers , impressions of skin,  internal organs  and  soft tissues . [ 43 ] [ 44 ]  Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including  physics  (especially  biomechanics ),  chemistry ,  biology , and the  earth sciences  (of which  paleontology  is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.     Size       Main article:  Dinosaur size              Scale diagram comparing the largest known dinosaurs in four  suborders  and a human.       While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the  sauropods  were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an  order of magnitude  more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric  mammals  such as the  Indricotherium  and the Columbian  mammoth  were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach or surpass them in size  most notably the  blue whale , which reaches up to 173,000 kilograms (381,000 lb) and over 30 meters (100 ft) in length. [ 45 ]  There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but it may be that the most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in  rock formations  interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments. [ 46 ]   Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. [ 31 ]  Theropod dinosaurs, when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on  order of magnitude , most often fall into the 100 to 1,000 kilogram (220 to 2,200 lb) category, whereas  recent  predatory  carnivorans  peak in the 10 to 100 kilogram (22 to 220 lb) category. [ 47 ]  The  mode  of dinosaur body masses is between one and ten metric tonnes. [ 48 ]  This contrasts sharply with the size of  Cenozoic  mammals, estimated by the  National Museum of Natural History  as about 2 to 5 kilograms (5 to 10 lb). [ 49 ]     Largest and smallest   Only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the  largest and smallest dinosaurs .          Comparative size of  Brachiosaurus .       The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is  Brachiosaurus brancai  (also known as  Giraffatitan ). Its remains were discovered in  Tanzania  between 190712. Bones from multiple similarly-sized individuals were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the  Humboldt Museum  of  Berlin ; [ 50 ]  this mount is 12 meters (39 ft) tall and 22.5 meters (74 ft) long, and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between 30,000 and 60,000 kilograms (70,000 and 130,000 lb). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 m (89 ft) long  Diplodocus , which was discovered in  Wyoming  in the  United States  and displayed in  Pittsburgh's   Carnegie Natural History Museum  in 1907.          Comparative size of  Eoraptor .       There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils. Most of the largest  herbivorous  specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive  Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed 80,000 to 100,000 kilograms (90 to 110 short tons); some of the longest, the 33.5 meters (110 ft) long  Diplodocus hallorum [ 46 ]  (formerly  Seismosaurus ) and the 33 meters (110 ft) long  Supersaurus ; [ 51 ]  and the tallest, the 18 meters (59 ft)  Sauroposeidon , which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The longest of them all may have been  Amphicoelias fragillimus , known only from a now lost partial vertebral  neural arch  described in 1878. Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone, the animal may have been 58 meters (190 ft) long and weighed over 120,000 kilograms (260,000 lb), [ 46 ]  heavier than all known dinosaurs except possibly the poorly known  Bruhathkayosaurus , which could have weighed 175,000 to 220,000 kilograms (400,000 to 500,000 lb). The largest known  carnivorous  dinosaur was  Spinosaurus , reaching a length of 16 to 18 meters (50 to 60 ft), and weighing in at 8,150 kilograms (18,000 lb). [ 52 ]  Other large meat-eaters included  Giganotosaurus ,  Mapusaurus ,  Tyrannosaurus rex  and  Carcharodontosaurus .   Not including modern birds, the smallest dinosaurs known were about the size of a  pigeon . [ 53 ]  The theropods  Anchiornis  and  Epidexipteryx  both had a total skeletal length of under 35 centimeters (1.1 ft). [ 54 ] [ 53 ]   Anchiornis  is currently the smallest dinosaur described from an adult specimen, with an estimated weight of 110 grams. [ 54 ]  The smallest herbivorous dinosaurs included  Microceratus  and  Wannanosaurus , at about 60 cm long (2 ft) each. [ 55 ] [ 56 ]     Behavior          A nesting ground of  Maiasaura  was discovered in 1978.       Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their  habitat ,  computer simulations  of their  biomechanics , and comparisons with modern animals in similar  ecological niches . As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.   The first potential evidence of  herding  behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31  Iguanodon  dinosaurs which were then thought to have perished together in  Bernissart ,  Belgium , after they fell into a deep, flooded  sinkhole  and drowned. [ 57 ]  Other mass death sites have been subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that  duck-bills  (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the  American Bison  or the African  Springbok . Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in  Oxfordshire , England, [ 58 ]  although there is not evidence for specific herd structures. [ 59 ]  Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for  migratory  purposes, or to provide protection for their young. There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in  Inner Mongolia  that has yielded the remains of over twenty  Sinornithomimus , from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud. [ 60 ]  The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as  pack hunters  working together to bring down large prey. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  However, this lifestyle is uncommon among the modern relatives of dinosaurs ( crocodiles  and other reptiles, and  birds  -  Harris's Hawk  is a well-documented exception), and the  taphonomic  evidence suggesting pack hunting in such theropods as  Deinonychus  and  Allosaurus  can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern  diapsid  predators. [ 63 ]          Fossilized egg of the  oviraptorid   Citipati ,  American Museum of Natural History .       Jack Horner's  1978 discovery of a  Maiasaura  (""good mother dinosaur"")  nesting  ground in  Montana  demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the  ornithopods . [ 64 ]  There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like  Patagonian   titanosaurian  sauropods (1997 discovery), also nested in large groups. [ 65 ]  The  Mongolian   oviraptorid   Citipati  was discovered in a  chicken -like  brooding  position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the  eggs  warm. [ 66 ]  Parental care is also implied by other finds. For example, the fossilized remains of a grouping of  Psittacosaurus  has been found, consisting of one adult and 34 juveniles; in this case, the large number of juveniles may be due to communal nesting. [ 67 ]  Additionally, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the  prosauropod   Massospondylus ) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur. [ 68 ]  Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the  Isle of Skye  in northwestern  Scotland . [ 69 ]  Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.          Artist's rendering of two  Centrosaurus , herbivorous  ceratopsid  dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous fauna of North America.       The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the  marginocephalians ,  theropods  and  lambeosaurines , may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and  territorialism . Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations. [ 70 ]  The nature of dinosaur  communication  also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent studies suggest that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as  resonance chambers  used for a wide range of  vocalizations . [ 71 ] [ 72 ]   From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the  Gobi Desert  in 1971. It included a  Velociraptor  attacking a  Protoceratops , [ 73 ]  providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. [ 74 ]  Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially-healed tail of an  Edmontosaurus , a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. [ 74 ]   Cannibalism  amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod  Majungasaurus . [ 75 ]   Based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as  Oryctodromeus , some herbivorous species seem to have led a partially  fossorial  (burrowing) lifestyle, [ 76 ]  and some bird-like species may have been  arboreal  (tree-climbing), most notably primitive  dromaeosaurids  such as  Microraptor [ 77 ]  and the enigmatic  scansoriopterygids . [ 78 ]  However, most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of  biomechanics , in particular, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, [ 79 ]  whether  diplodocids  could create  sonic booms  via  whip -like tail snapping, [ 80 ]  and whether sauropods could float. [ 81 ]     Physiology       Main article:  Physiology of dinosaurs               Tyrannosaurus rex  skull and upper vertebral column, Palais de la Dcouverte, Paris.       A vigorous debate on the subject of temperature regulation in dinosaurs has been ongoing since the 1960s. Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur  endotherm  has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation.   After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were  ectothermic  creatures: ""terrible  lizards "" as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness implied that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, comparable to modern reptiles, which need external sources of heat in order to regulate their body temperature. Dinosaur ectothermy remained a prevalent view until  Robert T. ""Bob"" Bakker , an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968.   Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (perhaps aided by the animals' bulk). Evidence of  endotherm  in dinosaurs includes the discovery of  polar dinosaurs in Australia  and  Antarctica  (where they would have experienced a cold, dark six-month winter), the discovery of dinosaurs whose feathers may have provided regulatory insulation, and analysis of blood-vessel structures that are typical of endotherms within dinosaur bone. Skeletal structures suggest that theropods and other dinosaurs had active lifestyles better suited to an endothermic cardiovascular system, while sauropods exhibit fewer endothermic characteristics. It is certainly possible that some dinosaurs were endothermic while others were not. Scientific debate over the specifics continues. [ 82 ]           Eubrontes , a dinosaur footprint in the Lower  Jurassic  Moenave Formation at the St. George Dinosaur Discovery Site at Johnson Farm, southwestern Utah.       Complicating the debate is the fact that warm-bloodedness can emerge based on more than one mechanism. Most discussions of dinosaur endothermy tend to compare them to average birds or mammals, which expend energy to elevate body temperature above that of the environment. Small birds and mammals also possess  insulation , such as  fat ,  fur , or  feathers , which slows down heat loss. However, large mammals, such as elephants, face a different problem because of their relatively small ratio of surface area to volume ( Haldane's  principle). This ratio compares the volume of an animal with the area of its skin: as an animal gets bigger, its surface area increases more slowly than its volume. At a certain point, the amount of heat radiated away through the skin drops below the amount of heat produced inside the body, forcing animals to use additional methods to avoid overheating. In the case of elephants, they have little hair as adults, and have large ears which increase their surface area, and have behavioral adaptations as well (such as using the trunk to spray water on themselves and mud wallowing). These behaviors increase cooling through evaporation.   Large dinosaurs would presumably have had to deal with similar issues; their body size suggest they lost heat relatively slowly to the surrounding air, and so could have been what are called  inertial homeotherms , animals that are warmer than their environments through sheer size rather than through special adaptations like those of birds or mammals. However, so far this theory fails to account for the numerous dog- and goat-sized dinosaur species, or the young of larger species.   Modern  computerized tomography  (CT) scans of a  dinosaur 's chest cavity (conducted in 2000) found the apparent remnants of a four-chambered heart, much like those found in today's mammals and birds. [ 83 ]  The idea is controversial within the scientific community, coming under fire for bad anatomical science [ 84 ]  or simply wishful thinking. [ 85 ]  The question of how this find reflects on metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy may be moot, though, regardless of the object's identity: both modern  crocodilians  and  birds , the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well. [ 86 ]     Soft tissue and DNA           Scipionyx samniticus  fossil showing tissue impressions, at the  Museo Civico di Storia Naturale , in Milan, Italy.       One of the best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in  Petraroia ,  Italy . The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young  coelurosaur ,  Scipionyx  samniticus . The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur. [ 43 ]   In the March 2005 issue of  Science , the paleontologist  Mary Higby Schweitzer  and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old  Tyrannosaurus rex  leg  bone  from the  Hell Creek Formation  in  Montana . After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team. [ 44 ]   When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as  blood vessels , bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear; study and interpretation of the material is ongoing. [ 44 ]   Newer research, published in PloS One (30 July 2008), has challenged the claims that the material found is the soft tissue of  Tyrannosaurus . Thomas Kaye of the  University of Washington  and his co-authors contend that what was really inside the tyrannosaur bone was slimy  biofilm  created by bacteria that coated the voids once occupied by blood vessels and cells. [ 87 ]  The researchers found that what previously had been identified as remnants of blood cells, because of the presence of iron, were actually  framboids , microscopic mineral spheres bearing iron. They found similar spheres in a variety of other fossils from various periods, including an  ammonite . In the ammonite they found the spheres in a place where the iron they contain could not have had any relationship to the presence of blood. [ 88 ]   The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions, but upon further inspection and  peer review , neither of these reports could be confirmed. [ 89 ]  However, a functional visual  peptide  of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds. [ 90 ]  In addition, several  proteins  have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils, [ 91 ]  including hemoglobin. [ 92 ]   Even if dinosaur DNA could be reconstructed, it would be exceedingly difficult to clone and ""grow"" dinosaurs using current technology since no closely related species exist to provide  zygotes  or a suitable environment for  embryonic development .     Feathers and the origin of birds       Main article:  Origin of birds       The possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by  Thomas Henry Huxley . [ 93 ]  After the work of  Gerhard Heilmann  in the early 20th century, the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of generalized  thecodont  ancestors, with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of  clavicles  in dinosaurs. [ 94 ]  However, as later discoveries showed, clavicles (or a single fused  wishbone , which derived from separate clavicles) were not actually absent; [ 8 ]  they had been found as early as 1924 in  Oviraptor , but misidentified as an  interclavicle . [ 95 ]  In the 1970s,  John Ostrom  revived the dinosaur-bird theory, [ 96 ]  which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis, [ 97 ]  and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds. [ 18 ]  Of particular note has been the fossils of the  Yixian Formation , where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found, often with feathers of some type. [ 8 ]  Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives. [ 98 ]  They are most closely allied with  maniraptoran  coelurosaurs. [ 8 ]  A minority of scientists, most notably  Alan Feduccia  and  Larry Martin , have proposed other evolutionary paths, including revised versions of Heilmann's basal archosaur proposal, [ 99 ]  or that maniraptoran theropods are the ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs, only  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ]     Feathers       Main article:  Feathered dinosaurs              The famous Berlin Specimen of  Archaeopteryx lithographica .       Archaeopteryx , the first good example of a ""feathered dinosaur"", was discovered in 1861. The initial specimen was found in the  Solnhofen limestone  in southern Germany, which is a  lagersttte , a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils.  Archaeopteryx  is a  transitional fossil , with features clearly intermediate between those of modern reptiles and birds. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal  The Origin of Species , its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of  evolutionary biology  and  creationism . This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for  Compsognathus . [ 101 ]   Since the 1990s, a number of additional  feathered dinosaurs  have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the  lagersttte  of the Yixian Formation,  Liaoning , northeastern  China , which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found only in a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be due to the fact that delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by  fossilization  and thus are absent from the fossil record. To this point, protofeathers (thin, filament-like structures) are known from dinosaurs at the base of Coelurosauria, such as  compsognathids  like  Sinosauropteryx  and  tyrannosauroids  ( Dilong ), [ 102 ]  but barbed feathers are only known among the coelurosaur subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. [ 8 ] [ 103 ]  The description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that protofeathers are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' integument, [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with barbed feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ] [ 105 ]  However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the question of the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been raised. [ 107 ]     Skeleton   Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the  missing link  between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for  paleontologists . Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck,  pubis ,  wrist  (semi-lunate  carpal ), arm and  pectoral girdle , furcula (wishbone), and  breast bone . Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through  cladistic analysis  strengthens the case for the link.     Soft anatomy   Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation which was led by  Patrick O'Connor  of  Ohio University . The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their  skeletons , as is the case in birds. ""What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds"", O'Connor said. [ 108 ]  In a paper published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE (September 29, 2008), scientists described  Aerosteon riocoloradensis , the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like breathing system.  CT-scanning  revealed the evidence of air sacs within the body cavity of the  Aerosteon  skeleton. [ 109 ] [ 110 ]   Another piece of evidence that birds and dinosaurs are closely related is the use of  gizzard  stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with  fossils , gizzard stones are called  gastroliths . [ 111 ]     Reproductive biology   A discovery of features in a  Tyrannosaurus rex   skeleton  recently provided more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs between the hard outer bone and the  marrow . This  medullary  bone, which is rich in  calcium , is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally-derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the  Tyrannosaurus rex  specimen's hind limb suggested that  T. rex  used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female. [ 112 ]  Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod  Allosaurus  and ornithopod  Tenontosaurus . Because the line of dinosaurs that includes  Allosaurus  and  Tyrannosaurus  diverged from the line that led to  Tenontosaurus  very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue. Medullary bone has been found in specimens of sub-adult size, which suggests that dinosaurs reached sexual maturity rather quickly for such large animals. [ 113 ]     Behavioral evidence   A recently discovered  troodont  fossil demonstrates that some dinosaurs slept like certain modern birds, with their heads tucked under their arms. [ 114 ]  This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds.     Extinction       Main articles:  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  and  KT boundary       Non-avian dinosaurs suddenly became  extinct  approximately 65 million years ago. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including  ammonites  ( nautilus -like  mollusks ),  mosasaurs , plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, herbivorous  turtles  and  crocodiles , most birds, and many groups of mammals. [ 16 ]  This  mass extinction  is known as the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event . The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the general consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.   At the peak of the Mesozoic, there were no  polar ice caps , and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250 meters (300 to 800 ft) higher than they are today. The planet's temperature was also much more uniform, with only 25  C  (45  F ) separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator. On average, atmospheric temperatures were also much warmer; the poles, for example, were 50 C (90 F) warmer than today. [ 115 ] [ 116 ]   The atmosphere's composition during the Mesozoic was vastly different as well. Carbon dioxide levels were up to 12 times higher than today's levels, and oxygen formed 32 to 35% of the atmosphere, as compared to 21% today. However, by the late Cretaceous, the environment was changing dramatically. Volcanic activity was decreasing, which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably. Some scientists hypothesize that climate change, combined with lower oxygen levels, might have led directly to the demise of many species. If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds, it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency, given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies. [ 16 ]     Impact event       Main article:  Chicxulub crater              The  Chicxulub Crater  at the tip of the  Yucatn Peninsula ; the impactor that formed this crater may have caused the dinosaur extinction.       The asteroid collision theory, which was brought to wide attention in 1980 by  Walter Alvarez  and colleagues, links the  extinction event  at the end of the Cretaceous period to a  bolide  impact approximately 65.5 million years ago. Alvarez  et al.  proposed that a sudden increase in  iridium  levels, recorded around the world in the period's rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. [ 117 ]  The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a 5 to 15 kilometer (3 to 9 mi) wide  bolide  hit in the vicinity of the  Yucatn Peninsula , creating the 170 kilometers (110 mi) wide  Chicxulub Crater  and triggering the  mass extinction . [ 118 ]  Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the  impact event . Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave.   Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun).   In September 2007, U.S. researchers led by  William Bottke  of the  Southwest Research Institute  in  Boulder, Colorado , and  Czech  scientists used  computer  simulations to identify the probable source of the Chicxulub impact. They calculated a 90% probability that a giant asteroid named  Baptistina , approximately 160 kilometers (100 mi) in diameter, orbiting in the asteroid belt which lies between  Mars  and  Jupiter , was struck by a smaller unnamed asteroid about 55 kilometers (35 mi) in diameter about 160 million years ago. The impact shattered Baptistina, creating a cluster which still exists today as the  Baptistina family . Calculations indicate that some of the fragments were sent hurtling into earth-crossing orbits, one of which was the 10 kilometers (6 mi) wide  meteorite  which struck  Mexico 's  Yucatan   peninsula  65 million years ago, creating the  Chicxulub crater  (175 kilometers (110 mi)). [ 119 ]   While similar to Alvarez's impact theory (which involved a single asteroid or comet), this theory proposes that ""passages of the  solar companion star Nemesis  through the  Oort comet cloud  would trigger comet showers."" [ 120 ]  One or more of these objects then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time, causing the worldwide extinction. As with the impact of a single asteroid, the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures, followed by a protracted cool period. [ 120 ]     Deccan Traps       Main article:  Deccan Traps       Before 2000, arguments that the  Deccan Traps   flood basalts  caused the  extinction  were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 mya and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two-thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in 1 million years about 65.5 mya, so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly a period of thousands of years, but still a longer period than what would be expected from a single impact event. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulphuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reducing photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the  greenhouse effect  when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere. [ 122 ]  Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of  volcanic gasses  during the formation of the  Deccan traps  ""contributed to an apparently massive  global warming . Some data point to an average rise in temperature of 8 C (14 F) in the last half million years before the  impact [at Chicxulub] ."" [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction,  Luis Alvarez  (who died in 1988) replied that  paleontologists  were being misled by  sparse data . While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in  sea level  and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions. [ 123 ]     Failure to adapt to changing conditions   Lloyd  et al.  (2008) noted that, in the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previously been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites   fossilized dung  indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Statistical analysis by Lloyd  et al.  concluded that, contrary to earlier studies, dinosaurs did not diversify very much in the Late Cretaceous. Lloyd  et al.  suggested that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Possible Paleocene survivors   Nonavian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the  K-T boundary . In 2002, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single  hadrosaur  leg bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico and described it as evidence of  Paleocene dinosaurs . The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early  Paleocene  epoch approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that  stratum  by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era. [ 124 ]  Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the  Hell Creek Formation  up to 1.3 meters (51 in) above (40,000 years later than) the K-T boundary. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China. [ 125 ]  Many scientists, however, dismiss the ""Paleocene dinosaurs"" as re-worked, i.e. washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments, [ 126 ] [ 127 ]  or find that, if correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction. [ 126 ]     History of discovery   Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese, whose modern word for dinosaur is  konglong  (, or ""terrible dragon""), considered them to be  dragon   bones  and documented them as such. For example,  Hua Yang Guo Zhi , a book written by Zhang Qu during the  Western Jin Dynasty , reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in  Sichuan  Province. [ 128 ]  Villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized ""dragon bones"" for use in traditional medicines, a practice that continues today. [ 129 ]  In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of  giants  and other creatures killed by the  Great Flood .   Scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in  England . Part of a bone, now known to have been the  femur  of a  Megalosaurus , [ 130 ]  was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near  Chipping Norton ,  Oxfordshire , England in 1676. The fragment was sent to  Robert Plot , Professor of Chemistry at the  University of Oxford  and first curator of the  Ashmolean Museum , who published a description in his  Natural History of Oxfordshire  in 1677. He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the  femur  of a large animal, but recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species. He therefore concluded it to be the thigh bone of a giant human similar to those mentioned in the  Bible . In 1699,  Edward Lhuyd , a friend of  Sir Isaac Newton , was responsible for the first published scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a  sauropod   tooth , "" Rutellum implicatum "" [ 131 ] [ 132 ] , that had been found in Caswell, near Whitney, Oxfordshire. [ 133 ]           William Buckland .       Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev  William Buckland , a professor of  geology  at  Oxford University , collected more fossilized bones of  Megalosaurus  and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a  scientific journal . [ 134 ] [ 130 ]  The second dinosaur genus to be identified,  Iguanodon , was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell - the wife of English geologist  Gideon Mantell . Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between  his fossils  and the bones of modern  iguanas . He published his findings in 1825. [ 135 ] [ 136 ]   The study of these ""great fossil lizards"" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist  Richard Owen  coined the term ""dinosaur"". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far,  Iguanodon ,  Megalosaurus  and  Hylaeosaurus , shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of  Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha , the husband of  Queen Victoria , Owen established the  Natural History Museum  in  South Kensington ,  London , to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.   In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in  marl  pits in the small town of  Haddonfield, New Jersey  (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named  Hadrosaurus  foulkii . It was an extremely important find;  Hadrosaurus  was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found and it was clearly a  bipedal  creature. ( The first  was in 1834, in Maidstone, Kent, England) This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the  United States .           Othniel Charles Marsh , 19th century photograph.               Edward Drinker Cope , 19th century photograph.       Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Othniel Charles Marsh , both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the  Bone Wars . The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an  Elasmosaurus  skeleton was flawed; Cope had inadvertently placed the  plesiosaur 's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the  US Geological Survey . Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods; for example, their diggers often used  dynamite  to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast; Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, for a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the  American Museum of Natural History  in  New York , while Marsh's is on display at the  Peabody Museum of Natural History  at  Yale University . [ 137 ]   Since 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils has extended to every continent, including  Antarctica . The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the  ankylosaurid   Antarctopelta oliveroi , was found on  Ross Island  in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod  Cryolophosaurus ellioti , was formally named and described in a scientific journal.   Current dinosaur ""hot spots"" include southern South America (especially  Argentina ) and  China . China in particular has produced many exceptional  feathered dinosaur  specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to  fossilization .     The ""dinosaur renaissance""       Main article:  Dinosaur renaissance       The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by  John Ostrom 's discovery of  Deinonychus , an active predator that may have been  warm-blooded , in marked contrast to the then-prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and  cold-blooded .  Vertebrate paleontology  has become a global  science . Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including  India , South America,  Madagascar ,  Antarctica , and most significantly in  China  (the amazingly well-preserved  feathered dinosaurs  in  China  have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of  cladistics , which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in  classifying  dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary  fossil record .     Cultural depictions       Main article:  Cultural depictions of dinosaurs              A  Megalosaurus  stalks  Crystal Palace Park  in  London .       By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word ""dinosaur"" into the common  vernacular  reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, ""dinosaur"" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, slow-moving, obsolete, or bound for extinction. [ 138 ]   Public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in  Victorian  England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, the famous  dinosaur sculptures  were unveiled in  London 's  Crystal Palace Park . The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and  museums  around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way. [ 139 ]  Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the  Bone Wars  of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions. [ 140 ]   The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in  literature ,  film  and other  media . Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in  Charles Dickens'   Bleak House , [ 141 ]  dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of  fictional  works.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's 1912 book  The Lost World , the iconic 1933  film   King Kong , 1954's  Godzilla  and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel  Jurassic Park  by  Michael Crichton  and its 1993  film adaptation  are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest  non-fictional  works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in  advertising ; numerous  companies  have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted or obsolete. [ 142 ]     Religious views       Main article:  Young Earth Creationism#Palaeontology and dinosaurs       Various religious groups have views about dinosaurs that differ from those held by the vast majority of scientists, usually due to conflicts with  creation stories  in their scriptures. However, most of the  scientific  community rejects these religiously-inspired interpretations of dinosaurs.

Penguins   Fossil range:  Paleocene -Recent         Gentoo Penguin ,  Pygoscelis papua         Scientific classification             Kingdom:   Animalia       Phylum:   Chordata       Class:   Aves       Infraclass:   Neognathae       Order:   Sphenisciformes   Sharpe , 1891       Family:   Spheniscidae   Bonaparte , 1831             Modern  genera         Aptenodytes   Eudyptes   Eudyptula   Megadyptes   Pygoscelis   Spheniscus  For prehistoric genera, see  Systematics         Penguins  ( order   Sphenisciformes ,  family   Spheniscidae ) are a group of  aquatic ,  flightless   birds  living almost exclusively in the  Southern Hemisphere . Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have  countershaded  dark and white plumage, and their wings have become  flippers . Most penguins feed on  krill ,  fish ,  squid , and other forms of  sealife  caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the  temperate  zone, and one species, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives near the equator.   The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and  weigh  35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the  Little Blue Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates ( see also   Bergmann's Rule ). Some  prehistoric  species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,  subantarctic  regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the  Equator  35  mya , in a climate decidedly warmer than today.   Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in  Antarctica  or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the  leopard seal . Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).

The  Drygalski ice tongue  is visible in the background.       Penguins are superbly adapted to an  aquatic  life. Their  vestigial   wings  have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth  plumage  a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their  tails  and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.   All penguins are  countershaded  for  camouflage   that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an  orca  or a  leopard seal ) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.   Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.   Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.   Penguins have an average sense of  hearing  for birds; [ 1 ]  this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded  colonies . [ 2 ]  Their  eyes  are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are  nearsighted , although research has not supported this hypothesis. [ 3 ]   Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which serve to keep them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.   They can drink salt water because their  supraorbital gland  filters excess salt from the bloodstream. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.     Breeding                   Chinstrap Penguins  in  Antarctica       Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, though the two largest species, the Emperor and the  King Penguins , lay only one. [ 7 ]  With the exception of the Emperor Penguin in all penguins share the  incubation  duties. [ 8 ]  These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.   Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 grams, the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450-gram Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. [ 7 ]  The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 2231% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food. [ 9 ]   When mothers lose a  chick , they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in large groups called  crches .           Isabelline  Adlie penguin on Gourdin Island         Range   Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as  Antarctica . In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. At least 10 [ verification needed ]  species live in the  temperate  zone; one, the  Galpagos Penguin , lives as far north as the  Galpagos Islands , but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic  Humboldt  current which flows around these islands. [ 10 ]   Major populations of penguins are found in:  Antarctica ,  Australia ,  New Zealand . [ 11 ]     Isabelline penguins   Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess  Isabella of Austria  vowed not to change her undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries by taking the city of  Ostend   which took three years to accomplish. [ 12 ]  Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.

Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  the actual situation seems to be more complicated. [ 15 ]  Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a color morph of the  Macaroni penguin .

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as equivalent to the  Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes, [ 18 ]  i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian  phylogeny  is presently resolved, this seems spurious [ neutrality disputed ]  and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed here.     Evolution   The  evolutionary  history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary  biogeography ; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the  alpha taxonomy  of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.   The  basal  penguins lived around the time of the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and  Byrd Land , Antarctica. [ 21 ]  Due to  plate tectonics , these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometers (2,485 mi) of today. The  most recent common ancestor  of penguins and their  sister clade  can be roughly dated to the  Campanian  Maastrichtian  boundary, around 7068 mya. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the  Cretaceous , the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so  morphologically ; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of  trophic webs  which follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see also   Flightless Cormorant ).     The basal fossils   The oldest known  fossil  penguin species is  Waimanu manneringi , which lived in the early  Paleocene  epoch of  New Zealand , or about 62  mya . [ 22 ]  While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins,  Waimanu  were generally  loon -like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were  as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct  already adapting to underwater locomotion.   Perudyptes  from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from  Argentina  proves that by the  Bartonian  (Middle  Eocene ), some 3938 mya, [ 24 ]  primitive penguins had spread to  South America  and were in the process of expanding into  Atlantic  waters. [ 18 ]     Palaeudyptines   During the Late Eocene and the Early  Oligocene  (4030 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.  Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin  was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (6 ft) tall. The  New Zealand Giant Penguin  was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on  New Zealand , the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.   Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the  paraphyletic   subfamily  called  Palaeeudyptinae . More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the  phylogeny  if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in  Patagonia , and at least one other  which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today  occurred on most  Antarctic  and  subantarctic  coasts.   But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin  radiation : on  Seymour Island , Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the  Priabonian  (Late Eocene). [ 25 ]  It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a  monophyletic  lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae  whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including  Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi ). [ 21 ]  The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot-tall  Icadyptes salasi , actually occurred as far north as northern  Peru  about 36 mya.   In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the  Paleogene , around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating  toothed whales , which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. [ 20 ]  A new lineage, the  Paraptenodytes  which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early  Neogene  saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly-sized but more gracile  Palaeospheniscinae , as well as the radiation which gave rise to the penguin  biodiversity  of our time.     Origin and systematics of modern penguins   Modern penguins consititute two undisputed  clades  and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. [ 19 ]  The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. [ 20 ]  Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, [ 20 ]  it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the  Antarctic Peninsula  and  Patagonia  have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.   The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.   Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external  morphology , these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'   autapomorphies  are in most cases fairly pronounced  adaptations  related to that genus' extreme  habitat  conditions. As the former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, [ 26 ]  but the range expansion and radiation which led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the  Burdigalian  stage of the Early  Miocene , roughly 2015 mya. [ 20 ]   The  genera   Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on  South America ; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack  carotenoid  coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the  Chattian  (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. [ 20 ]  While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a  Pliocene  radiation, taking place some 42 mya. [ 20 ]   The  Megadyptes  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar  latitudes  (though not as far north as the  Galapagos Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene ( Langhian , roughly 1514 mya), but again, the living species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late  Tortonian  (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. [ 20 ]   The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of  global cooling  documented in the  paleoclimatic record . [ 20 ]  The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the  ice ages  some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South America and eventually beyond. [ 20 ]   Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the  Middle Miocene Climate Transition , a sharp drop in global average temperature from 1412 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the  Antarctic ice sheet  was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.     Relationship to other bird orders   Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are  homoplasies . On the other hand, different  DNA sequence  datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.          The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having  flippers  instead of wings.       What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except  paleognaths  and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient  waterfowl . This group contains such birds as  storks ,  rails , and the  seabirds , with the possible exception of the  Charadriiformes . [ 27 ]   Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to  Ciconiiformes [ 22 ]  or to  Procellariiformes [ 20 ]  has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like  plotopterids  (usually considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the  Pelecaniformes  and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. [ 28 ]   The  Auk  of the  Northern Hemisphere  is superficially similar to penguins: they are not related to the penguins at all, but considered by some [ who? ]  to be a product of moderate  convergent evolution . [ 29 ]     Penguins and humans     Etymology          A penguin encounters a  human  during Antarctic summer.       The word  Penguin  is thought by some to derive from the  Welsh  words  pen  (head) and  gwyn  (white), [ 30 ]  applied to the  Great Auk  which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black); or from an island off Newfoundland known as  Pengwyn , due to its having a large white rock. (In the latter case, the name may also have come from  Breton .) This theory is supported by the fact that penguins look remarkably like Great Auks in general shape.   It is also possible that  penguin  comes from the  Latin   pinguis , fat. This is supported by the fact that the corresponding words in most other languages (e.g., French  pingouin , German  Pinguin ) have  i  instead of  e  as the first vowel. [ 30 ]  However, a Welsh  i  is often sound-shifted to an  e  in the English language. [ citation needed ]   Another theory states that the word is an alteration of pen-wing, with reference to the rudimentary wings of both Great Auks and penguins, but there is no evidence to support this. [ 30 ]   What may be a King Penguin but certainly is a member of the  Spheniscidae  appears on a 1599 map at the  Strait of Magellan  with the caption ""Pinguyn"". The map's features are labeled in Latin, such as  Fretum Magellanicum  (""Strait of Magellan""). In addition, there is ample evidence that the Latin term  anser magellanicus  (""Goose of Magellan"" or ""Magellanic Goose"") was the usual term for penguins in the scholarly literature of that time. If the English word was derived from Latin  e.g.  avis pinguis  (""fat bird"") or  pinguinus  (""the fat one"" [ verification needed ] )  it must have originated considerably earlier than 1600.   In a final twist to the story, the term ""Magellanic Goose"" (today usually "" Magellan Goose "") in our time has come to denote an actual  anseriform , namely a  Chloephaga  sheldgoose.   The pronunciation of the word in English varies somewhat: as either ""PEN-gwin"" or ""PENG-gwin"".     Penguins in popular culture           Tux  the  Linux kernel  mascot       Main article:  Penguins in popular culture   Penguins are popular around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a  tuxedo  suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the  North Pole . This is incorrect, as there are almost no wild penguins in the  northern hemisphere , except the small group on the northernmost of the  Galpagos . The cartoon series  Chilly Willy  helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interract with northern-hemisphere species such as polar bears and walruses.   Penguins have been the subject of many books and films such as  Happy Feet  and  Surf's Up , both  CGI  films;  March of the Penguins , a documentary based on the migration process of Emperors; and a parody entitled  Farce of the Penguins . Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas; perhaps the most notable of these is  Pingu , created by  Silvio Mazzola  in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.   The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion exploited by cartoonists such as  Gary Larson .   Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist  Steve Bell  in his strip in  The Guardian  Newspaper, particularly during and following the  Falklands War .   In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting  homosexual couples . A  children's book ,  And Tango Makes Three , was written about  one such penguin family  in the  New York Zoo .     References     Footnotes       ^  Wever  et al.  (1969).   ^  Jouventin  et al.

If you can't find the answer to your questions here, please  send us an email  and we will try to give you an answer. Maybe we will add the question and answer to this page as well.     Probably the most often asked question is:  Are there penguins at the North Pole?  Sometimes this is phrased as:  Why don't Polar Bears eat Penguins?  But it is better asked as:   Why are there no penguins in the Northern Hemisphere?    Other often asked questions are:      Can I keep a penguin as a pet?      How tall is the tallest penguin?      How do penguins sleep?      Do penguins have tongues?      How fast do penguins swim?      How sharp is a penguins beak?      How long do penguins live?      How long do the parents look after their offspring?      I have heard that penguins walk a long way to their rookeries, is this true?      Why do penguins have white fronts and black backs?      Why can't penguins fly?      What sounds do penguins make?      How do penguins keep warm?      How do penguins keep cool?           Why are there no penguins in the Northern Hemisphere?    Penguins evolved in the Southern Hemisphere taking advantage of the very rich fish stocks in the cold currents of the Southern Ocean.  They need to have plentiful supplies of fish to survive and the conditions for large schools of fish and crustaceans only occur in cold waters.  So although the conditions are suitable both in the Northern and Southern Polar regions, the penguins have never managed to cross into the cold Northern waters.  Penguins can be found anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere where there are cold ocean currents.  The most northerly penguins are found on the equator in the Galapagos Islands.  The Humboldt Current carries cold Antarctic waters right up the coast of South America to the equator and provides sufficiently rich fishing grounds for the penguins.  However, to cross the much warmer tropical waters to reach the cold northern waters which only extend down to Northern Europe, Russia and Canada, has proved to be too great a journey for the penguins.  The Auks occupy a similar ecolological niche in these Northern waters.   return to top of page        Can I keep a penguin as a pet?  Over the years we have often been asked about the possibility of keeping penguins as pets. We are no experts, but we have talked to several. They all are completely against the idea.   First off, all species of penguin are protected so that you could only (legally) get a penguin from a Zoo that had bred it.   Secondly, you would need a constant and reliable supply of fresh frozen fish as well as appropriate vitamin supplements, you would also need to know a vet who was familiar with penguins and the many diseases they are prone to when kept in captivity.   Thirdly, you would need to be able to feed the birds every day so you couldn't take any more vacations! You can't just put a penguin into kennels!   Fourthly, you would need to build a suitable enclosure to keep the bird - remember different species have very different environmental requirements (temperature, vegetation etc.). For example, there are no species of penguin that could live outside year round in say Chicago with its wide temperature variations. Plus all species of penguins require access to a large, deep and clean pool of water - preferably salt water.   Fifthly, penguins tend to live in large colonies - anything less than say 20 birds would not be sufficient. So you would need a very healthy income. Zoo's here reckon it costs around 400 pounds (700 US$) per year just to keep a penguin in fish!   Finally, why would you want to keep penguins for yourself anyway? They are much better left in the wild or in well looked after breeding colonies in Zoos and Aquaria. Remember that nearly all species are endangered to some extent or another.   We would strongly discourage anyone from trying to keep a penguin as a pet - except the cuddly toy variety!   return to top of page        How tall is the tallest penguin?  The largest living penguins are the Emperors. Emperor penguins stand around 1.2metres tall and weigh around 40kg.   However, in the fossil records penguin bones have been found which suggest there were some now extinct penguins that may have been as tall as 2 metres!   return to top of page        How do penguins sleep?  Different species of penguin sleep at different times and in different ways. Most penguins only take short naps. However, a few species (such as the Fairy penguins) come ashore every night and sleep for a few hours in their burrows. The other penguins spend most of their time at sea (some live at sea for more than 9 months of the year never coming ashore) and must sleep at sea - but no-one has been able to observe this behaviour yet.   return to top of page        Do penguins have tongues?  It certainly is not a stupid question to ask whether penguins have tongues. In fact all birds have tongues of some sort or another. Penguins have very specialised tongues that are rarely seen since they don't extend out of the beak. Penguins tongues are covered with lots of little spiky spines that all point backward into the throat so that when a penguin catches a fish it is gripped by the spines and cannot escape.   return to top of page        How fast do penguins swim?  Different species of penguins can swim at different speeds. Generally the larger species swim faster than the smaller ones. Gentoo penguins have been clocked at speeds of 15 miles per hour (maybe 25 kph). Penguins reach their top speeds when they are porpoising through the water.   return to top of page        How sharp is a penguins beak?  Again the sharpness of the beak will vary with species, but also with individual penguins. In the wild the penguins that nest in burrows (the African, Humboldt, Magellanic, Galapagos and Little Blue) all use their beaks to help dig out the burrows so the beaks get worn down, and in some cases sharpened at the same time. We have been pecked by quite a few penguins and we can say their beaks are sharp enough for it to hurt a lot!   return to top of page        How long do penguins live?  In the wild there haven't been any reliable long term studies of individual penguins that can tell how long they live. The only such study was carried out in the 1940's and 50's by Lance Richdale in New Zealand. He monitored a population of Yellow-eyed penguins over a 15 year period. Certainly there were some chicks that he saw hatch that survived through most of the study; so it is reasonable to put the lifespan of Yellow-eyed penguins at 15 years or more. The only other information comes from studies on captive birds. Zoos and aquaria often know how old their birds are when they die. However, the common causes of death in captivity (Avian Malaria and Aspergillosis) are not particularly prevalent in the wild so the experiences with captive birds are probably under-estimates. On the other hand the captive birds will not suffer starvation if fish stocks go down suddenly and they have no predators (such as leopard seals and killer whales) to kill them. Anyway, zoos reckon birds live 10 to 20 years depending on species, with the larger species generally being longer lived.   return to top of page        How long do the parents look after their offspring?  Chicks stay with their parents until they have grown a waterproof set of feathers. For King penguins this can take as much as 15 months, but for most species it is a matter of only 7 to 10 weeks. Yellow-eyed penguins still keep close to their parents while on land even after fledging for at least another year.   return to top of page        I have heard that penguins walk a long way to their rookeries, is this true?  Most species of penguin may have their breeding colonies a significant distance from the shore. For example, African penguins on Robben Island may nest up to half a mile inland. Fiordland penguins have their nest sites several hundred feet above sea level. It is the Antarctic penguins who travel the furthest because the sea freezes or melts during their breeding seasons.    The longest distances are walked by Emperors who come ashore at the beginning of winter to start breeding; at that time the rookeries may be a few kilometres from the open sea. The females leave the rookeries once the eggs have been laid by which time the sea has started to freeze so they have to walk maybe as much as 30 km to get back to the sea. The females then return about 9 weeks later when the eggs are hatching and relieve the males. The return journey for the females is again longer, up to 50 km, because more sea has frozen. The males, now exhausted and starving after incubating the eggs then waddle back over 60 km to the open sea. The maximum distances they sometimes have to walk can be well over 100km!   return to top of page       Why do penguins have white fronts and black backs?    The usual reason given is that it provides camouflage when the birds are in the water.  The black backs mean that the penguins are difficult to see from above against the dark seas, while the white fronts make them hard to see from below against the light sky.  Thus predators such as seals, sharks and Killer Whales will find it difficult to hunt penguins.  Another explanation sometimes suggested is that the penguins can use their colouration as a form of thermal control.  If they are cold they can stand with their black backs to the sun and so absorb heat, while if they are hot they can stand with their white fronts to the sun and reflect the sun's rays.  This second explanation may be true in a few limited cases, but many species of penguin nest in the open and will always have their black backs upward, so that even on hot, sunny days, they will be absorbing heat.  We have seen African penguins on nests becoming quite overheated because of a strong sun.  These overly hot birds lie with their flippers extended to try to radiate some heat and also open their mouths and pant to try to lose some more heat that way.   return to top of page     Why can't penguins fly?    Long ago the ancestor's of penguins were birds that could fly.  However, they evolved to become superb divers, and in the process lost the power of flight.  A flying bird has to minimise its weight.  For example, all flying birds have hollow bones.  In contrast, to be a successful diver a penguin wants to keep it's weight high, so they have solid bones. Penguins are excellent divers, they can dive to depths of 1000m and remain down for up to 20 minutes.  While penguins cannot fly in the air, they do seem to fly through the water - if you ever get the chance to see penguins swimming in a large and deep pool you will never again say they can't fly!   return to top of page     What sounds do penguins make?    All penguins use sounds to communicate.  Chicks in large colonies need to be able to attract their own parents so that they can be fed, adults need to recognise one another when they come back from fishing trips, etc.  Different species make different noises.  African, Humboldt, Magellanic and Galapagos all make braying sounds (like a donkey) and each of these species has at some time been known as ""Jackass"" penguins as a result.  Their chicks, in contrast, make a high pitched whistling noise to demand feeding.  The Yellow-eyed penguin makes a trilling sound (not unlike the old ""trim-phone"").  The Chinstrap has a shrill, screaming voice, so loud that it is sometimes called the stone-cracker penguin. The King penguin makes a trumpeting sound.   return to top of page     How do penguins keep warm?    How do penguins keep cool?   These are really one and the same question.  All penguins swim in cold waters and so need a good layer of insulation, some species come ashore in hot places (Humboldt penguins nest in arid hot - ca. 40°C, deserts on the West coast of South America) while others survive the lowest temperatures of any animals (male Emperor penguins spend the Antarctic winters incubating eggs in temperatures that can fall below -70°C).  The insulation is provided in layers, under the skin is a thick layer of blubber, then there is a layer of downy feathers that trap air, and finally another layer of waterproof feathers that keep the cold water away from the skin.  With all this insulation penguins have no problem keeping warm at temperatures down to about -10°C - although they have special adaptions of the circulatory system to keep their feet from freezing and to prevent much heat loss through the feet that are on the ice.  At lower temperatures penguins have to huddle together to keep warm.  In such huddles the penguins gradually move from the hot interior to the cold outside so that every penguin has his turn in the middle and on the outside.   In hot climates, penguins suffer greatly from overheating.  They use several strategies to lose heat.  They puff up their feathers so that air can circulate to their skin; they hold their flippers out from their bodies and pump hot blood to them so that they can act as radiators to lose heat; they open their mouths and pant to lose heat from their hot breath; and those species that live in hot climates also have several bare patches of skin (around the eyes and feet), they send blood to these bare patches when they are hot - you can recognise a hot penguin since it will have pink eye patches and pink patches on its feet.   return to top of page              Guide to Pete & Barb's Penguin Pages    Front Page and Introduction  ·  Descriptions of the Penguins  ·  Detailed Species Notes  ·  Breeding Behaviour  ·  Common questions  ·  Penguin Goodies  ·  Penguin Bibliography  ·  Good Penguin Guide  ·  Photo Index  ·  Links to other penguin sites  ·  'Penguin-balls'  ·  Endangered Penguins  ·    Return to the top of this page             "

For the band, see  Emperor Penguin (music) .       Emperor Penguin                 Conservation status           Least Concern  ( IUCN 3.1 ) [ 1 ]         Scientific classification             Kingdom:   Animalia       Phylum:   Chordata       Class:   Aves       Order:   Sphenisciformes       Family:   Spheniscidae       Genus:   Aptenodytes       Species:   A. forsteri             Binomial name       Aptenodytes forsteri   Gray , 1844         Emperor Penguin range  Breeding colonies in green         The  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ) is the tallest and heaviest of all living  penguin  species and is  endemic  to  Antarctica . The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching 122 cm (48 in) in height and weighing anywhere from 2237 kg (4882 lb). The dorsal parts are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine lifestyle.   Fish form the bulk of its diet, which can include  crustaceans , such as  krill , and  cephalopods , such as  squid . In hunting, the species can remain submerged up to 18 minutes, diving to a depth of 535 m (1,755 ft). It has several adaptations to facilitate this, including an unusually structured  haemoglobin  to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce  barotrauma , and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions.   The Emperor Penguin is perhaps best known for the sequence of journeys adults make each year in order to mate and to feed their offspring. The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, it treks 50120 km (3175 mi) over the ice to  breeding colonies  which may include thousands of individuals. The female lays a single egg, which is incubated by the male while the female returns to the sea to forage; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick in the colony. The lifespan is typically 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live to 50 years of age.

[ 2 ]  Its specific epithet is in honour of the German naturalist  Johann Reinhold Forster , who accompanied Captain  James Cook  on his second Pacific Voyage and officially named five other penguin species.   Together with the similarly coloured but smaller  King Penguin  ( A. patagonicus ), the Emperor Penguin is one of two extant species in the genus  Aptenodytes .  Fossil  evidence of a third species Ridgen's Penguin  ( A. ridgeni )has been found in fossil records from the late  Pliocene , about three million years ago, in New Zealand. [ 3 ]  Studies of penguin behaviour and genetics have proposed that the genus  Aptenodytes  is  basal ; in other words, that it split off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species. [ 4 ]   Mitochondrial  and  nuclear   DNA  evidence suggests this split occurred around 40 million years ago. [ 5 ]     Description          Adults with chicks       The adult Emperor Penguin stands up to 122 cm (48 in) tall and can weigh from 22 to 45 kg (50100 lb), depending on where it is in the reproductive cycle; both male and female penguins lose substantial mass while raising hatchlings and  incubating  eggs. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  Like all penguin species, it has a streamlined body to minimise drag while swimming, and wings that have become stiff, flat flippers. [ 8 ]  The tongue is equipped with rear-facing barbs to prevent prey from escaping when caught. [ 9 ]  Males and females are similar in size and colouration. [ 6 ]  The adult has deep black  dorsal  feathers, covering the head, chin, throat, back, dorsal part of the flippers, and tail. The black plumage is sharply delineated from the light-coloured plumage elsewhere. The underparts of the wings and belly are white, becoming pale yellow in the upper breast, while the ear patches are bright yellow. The upper mandible of the 8 cm (3 in) long bill is black, and the lower mandible can be pink, orange or lilac. [ 10 ]  In juveniles, the auricular patches, chin and throat are white, while its bill is black. [ 10 ]  The Emperor Penguin chick is typically covered with silver-grey  down  and has a black head and white mask. [ 10 ]  A chick with all-white plumage was found in 2001, but was not considered to be an  albino  as it did not have pink eyes. [ 11 ]  Chicks weigh around 315 g (11 oz) after hatching, and  fledge  when they reach about 50% of adult weight. [ 12 ]   The Emperor Penguin's dark plumage fades to brown from November to February, before the yearly  moult  in January and February. [ 10 ]  Moulting is rapid in this species compared with other birds, taking only around 34 days. Emperor Penguin feathers emerge from the skin after they have grown to a third of their total length, and before old feathers are lost, to help reduce heat loss. New feathers then push out the old ones before finishing their growth. [ 13 ]   The average yearly survival rate of the Emperor Penguin has been measured at 95.1%, with an average life expectancy of 19.9 years. The same researchers estimated that 1% of Emperor Penguins born could feasibly reach an age of 50 years. [ 14 ]  In contrast, only 19% of chicks survive their first year of life. [ 15 ]  Therefore, 80% of the Emperor Penguin population comprises adults five years and older. [ 14 ]     Vocalization   As the species has no fixed nest sites that individuals can use to locate their own partner or chick, the Emperor Penguin must rely on vocal calls alone for identification. [ 16 ]  It uses a complex set of calls that are critical to individual recognition between parents, offspring, and mates, [ 6 ]  displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguins. [ 16 ]  Vocalizing Emperor Penguins use two  frequency bands  simultaneously. [ 17 ]  Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents. [ 6 ]     Adaptations to cold          An Emperor Penguin can hold its breath anywhere up to 20 minutes, and dive over 550 meters (1,800 ft) [ 18 ]       The Emperor Penguin breeds in the coldest environment of any bird species; air temperatures may reach 40 C (40 F), and wind speeds may reach 144 km/h (89 mph). Water temperature is a frigid 1.8 C (28.8 F),which is much lower than the Emperor Penguin's average body temperature of 39 C (102 F). The species has adapted in several ways to counteract heat loss. [ 19 ]  Feathers provide 8090% of its insulation, and it has a layer of sub- dermal  fat which may be up to 3 cm (1.2 in) thick before breeding. [ 20 ]  This resultant blubber layer impedes the mobility of the Emperor on land compared to its less well fat-insulated cousin, the  Magellanic Penguin . [ 21 ]  Its stiff feathers are short, lanceolate (spear-shaped), and densely packed over the entire skin surface. With around 100 feathers covering one square inch (15/cm 2 ), it has the highest feather density of any bird species. [ 22 ]  An extra layer of insulation is formed by separate shafts of downy filaments between feathers and skin. Muscles allow the feathers to be held erect on land, reducing heat loss by trapping a layer of air next to the skin. Conversely, the plumage is flattened in water, thus waterproofing the skin and the downy underlayer. [ 23 ]  Preening is vital in facilitating insulation and in keeping the plumage oily and water-repellent. [ 24 ]   The Emperor Penguin is able to  thermoregulate  (maintain its core body temperature) without altering its metabolism, over a wide range of temperatures. Known as the thermoneutral range, this extends from 10 to 20 C (10 to 70 F). Below this temperature range, its metabolic rate increases significantly, although an individual can maintain its  core temperature  between 37.6 and 38.0 C (99.7 to 100.4 F) down to 47 C (53 F). [ 25 ]  Movement by swimming, walking, and shivering are three mechanisms for increasing metabolism; a fourth process involves an increase in the breakdown of fats by enzymes, which is induced by the hormone  glucagon . [ 26 ]  At temperatures above 20 C (68 F), an Emperor Penguin may become agitated as its body temperature and metabolic rate rise to increase heat loss. Raising its wings and exposing the undersides increases the exposure of its body surface to the air by 16%, facilitating further heat loss. [ 27 ]     Adaptations to pressure          Diagram of pressure differences depending on depth       In addition to the cold, the Emperor Penguin encounters another adverse environment on deep dives that of the markedly increased pressure of up to 40 times that of the surface, which in most other terrestrial organisms would cause  barotrauma . The bones of the penguin are solid rather than air-filled, which eliminates the risk of mechanical barotrauma.   However, it is unknown how the species avoids the effects of nitrogen-induced  decompression sickness . Oxygen use is markedly reduced, as its heart rate is reduced to as low as five beats per minute and non-essential organs are shut down, thus facilitating longer dives. [ 9 ]  The Emperor Penguin's  haemoglobin  and  myoglobin  are able to bind and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations; this allows the bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would normally result in the loss of consciousness. [ 28 ]     Distribution and habitat   The Emperor Penguin has a circumpolar distribution in the Antarctic almost exclusively between the 66 and 77 south latitudes. It almost always breeds on stable pack ice near the coast and up to 18 km (11 mi) offshore. [ 6 ]  Breeding colonies are usually located in areas where ice cliffs and icebergs shelter them from the wind. [ 6 ]  The total population is estimated at around 400,000450,000 individuals, which are distributed among as many as 40 independent colonies. [ 29 ]  Around 80,000 pairs breed in the  Ross Sea  sector. [ 30 ]  Major breeding colonies are located at Cape Washington (20,00025,000 pairs),  Coulman Island  in  Victoria Land  (around 22,000 pairs), Halley Bay,  Coats Land  (14,30031,400 pairs), and Atka Bay in  Queen Maud Land  (16,000 pairs). [ 29 ]  Two land colonies have been reported: one on a shingle spit at Dion Island on the  Antarctic Peninsula , [ 31 ]  and one on a headland at  Taylor Glacier  in the  Australian Antarctic Territory . [ 32 ]  Vagrants have been recorded on  Heard Island , [ 33 ]   South Georgia , and in  New Zealand . [ 29 ] [ 34 ]     Behaviour          Emperor Penguin colony       The Emperor Penguin is a  social animal  in its nesting and its foraging behaviour; birds hunting together may coordinate their diving and surfacing. [ 35 ]  Individuals may be active day or night. A mature adult travels throughout most of the year between the nesting area and ocean foraging areas; the species disperses into the oceans from January to March. [ 29 ]   The American  physiologist  Gerry Kooyman revolutionized the study of penguin foraging behaviour in 1971 when he published his results from attaching automatic dive-recording devices to Emperor Penguins. He found that the species reaches depths of 265 m (869 ft), with dive periods of up to 18 minutes. [ 35 ]  Later research revealed a small female had dived to a depth of 535 m (1,755 ft) near  McMurdo Sound . It is possible that the Emperor Penguin can dive even deeper, as the accuracy of the recording devices is diminished at greater depths. [ 36 ]  Further study of one bird's diving behaviour revealed regular dives to 150 m (490 ft) in water around 900 m (3,000 ft) deep, and shallow dives of less than 50 m (160 ft), interspersed with deep dives of more than 400 m (1,300 ft) in depths of 450 to 500 m (1500 to 1600 ft). [ 37 ]  This was suggestive of feeding near or at the sea bottom. [ 38 ]   Both male and female Emperor Penguins forage for food up to 500 km (311 mi) from colonies while collecting food to feed chicks, covering 821,454 km (51904 mi) per individual per trip. A male returning to the sea after incubation heads directly out to areas of permanent open water, known as  polynyas , around 100 km (62 mi) from the colony. [ 37 ]   An efficient swimmer, the Emperor Penguin exerts pressure with both its upward and downward strokes while swimming. [ 22 ]  The upward stroke works against buoyancy and helps maintain depth. [ 39 ]  Its average swimming speed is 69 km/h (46 mph). [ 40 ]  On land, the Emperor Penguin alternates between walking with a wobbling gait and tobogganingsliding over the ice on its belly, propelled by its feet and wing-like flippers. Like all penguins, it is flightless. [ 8 ]   As a defence against the cold, a colony of Emperor Penguins forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) ranging in size from ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. Those on the outside tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and the outside. [ 41 ]     Diet   The Emperor Penguin's diet consists mainly of fish,  crustaceans  and  cephalopods , [ 42 ]  although its composition varies from population to population. Fish are usually the most important food source, and the  Antarctic silverfish  ( Pleuragramma antarcticum ) makes up the bulk of the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family  Nototheniidae , the  Glacial Squid  ( Psychroteuthis glacialis ), and the  hooked squid  species  Kondakovia longimana , as well as  Antarctic krill  ( Euphausia superba ). [ 38 ]  The Emperor Penguin searches for prey in the open water of the  Southern Ocean , in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. [ 6 ]  One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around 50 m (164 ft), where it can easily spot sub-ice fish like the  Bald notothen  ( Pagothenia borchgrevinki ) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up to the bottom of the ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe. [ 43 ]     Predators          Skua flying over Emperor Penguin chicks,  Ross Sea ,  Antarctica       The Emperor Penguin's predators include birds and aquatic mammals; the  Southern Giant Petrel  ( Macronectes giganteus ) is the predominant avian predator, responsible for up to 34% of chick deaths in some colonies. The  South Polar Skua  ( Stercorarius maccormicki ) mainly scavenges for dead chicks, as the live chicks are too large to be attacked by the time of its annual arrival in the colony. [ 44 ]   The primary aquatic predators are both mammals: the  Leopard Seal  ( Hydrurga leptonyx ), which takes some adult birds, as well as fledglings soon after they enter the water, [ 24 ]  and the  Orca  ( Orcinus orca ), which takes adult birds. [ 45 ]          The life-cycle of the Emperor Penguin         Courtship and breeding   The Emperor Penguin is able to breed at around three years of age, and usually commences breeding around one to three years later. [ 12 ]  The yearly reproductive cycle begins at the start of the Antarctic winter, in March and April, when all mature Emperor Penguins travel to colonial nesting areas, often walking 50 to 120 km (30 to 75 mi) inland from the edge of the pack ice. [ 46 ]  The start of travel appears to be triggered by decreasing day lengths; Emperor Penguins in captivity have been induced successfully into breeding by using lighting systems mimicking seasonal Antarctic day lengths. [ 47 ]   The penguins start  courtship  in March or April, when the temperature can be as low as 40 C (40 F). A lone male gives an ecstatic display, where it stands still and places its head on its chest before inhaling and giving a courtship call for 12 seconds; it then moves around the colony and repeats the call. A male and female then stand face to face, with one extending its head and neck up and the other mirroring it; they both hold this posture for several minutes. Once in pairs, couples waddle around the colony together, with the female usually following the male. Before  copulation , one bird bows deeply to its mate, its bill pointed close to the ground, and its mate then does the same. [ 48 ]   Emperor Penguins are  serially monogamous . They have only one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 15%. [ 48 ]  The narrow window of opportunity available for mating appears to be an influence, as there is a priority to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for the appearance of the previous year's partner. [ 49 ]          The egg of the Emperor Penguin. It is 12  8 cm and vaguely pear-shaped.       The female penguin lays one 460470 g (1 lb)  egg  in May or early June; [ 48 ]  it is vaguely pear-shaped, pale greenish-white, and measures around 12  8 cm (4 x 3 in). [ 46 ]  It represents just 2.3% of its mother's body weight, making it one of the smallest eggs relative to the maternal weight in any bird species. [ 50 ]  15.7% of the weight of an Emperor Penguin egg is shell; like those of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick to minimise risk of breakage. [ 51 ]   After laying, the mother's nutritional reserves are exhausted and she very carefully transfers the egg to the male, before immediately returning to the sea for two months to feed. [ 46 ]  The transfer of the egg can be awkward and difficult, and many couples drop the egg in the process. When this happens, the chick inside is quickly lost, as the egg cannot withstand the freezing temperatures on the icy ground. The male spends the winter  incubating  the egg in his brood pouch, balancing it on the tops of his feet, for 64 consecutive days until hatching. [ 48 ]  The Emperor Penguin is the only species where this behaviour is observed; in all other penguin species both parents take shifts incubating. [ 52 ]  By the time the egg hatches, the male will have fasted for around 115 days since arriving at the colony. [ 48 ]  To survive the cold and winds of up to 200 km/h (120 mph), the males huddle together, taking turns in the middle of the huddle. They have also been observed with their backs to the wind to conserve body heat. In the four months of travel, courtship, and incubation, the male may lose as much as 20 kg (44 lb), from around 38 kg to just 18 kg (84 lb to 40 lb). [ 53 ] [ 54 ]   Hatching may take as long as two or three days to complete, as the shell of the egg is thick. Newly hatched chicks are  semi-altricial , covered with only a thin layer of down and entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth. [ 55 ]  If the chick hatches before the mother's return, the father feeds it a curd-like substance composed of 59%  protein  and 28%  lipid , which is produced by a gland in his  esophagus . [ 56 ]  The young chick is  brooded  in what is called the  guard phase , spending time balanced on its parent's feet and sheltered in the brood pouch. [ 55 ]          Emperor Penguin feeding a chick       The female penguin returns at any time from hatching to ten days afterwards, from mid-July to early August. [ 46 ]  She finds her mate among the hundreds of fathers by his vocal call and takes over caring for the chick, feeding it by regurgitating the food that she has stored in her stomach. The male then leaves to take his turn at sea, spending around 24 days there before returning. [ 46 ]  His trip is slightly shorter than it was originally, because the melting of ice in the summer gradually decreases the distance between the breeding site and the open sea. The parents then take turns, one  brooding  while the other forages at sea. [ 48 ]   About 4550 days after hatching, the chicks form a  crche , huddling together for warmth and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically to feed their chicks. [ 55 ]  A crche may comprise up to several thousand birds densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures. [ 57 ]   From early November, chicks begin moulting into juvenile plumage, which takes up to two months and is often not completed by the time they leave the colony; adults cease feeding them during this time. All birds make the considerably shorter trek to the sea in December or January and spend the rest of the summer feeding there. [ 58 ] [ 24 ]     Relationship with humans   The species has been bred outside Antarctica at  SeaWorld San Diego ; more than 20 individuals have hatched there since 1980. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  Considered a flagship species, 55 individuals were counted in captivity in North American zoos and aquaria in 1999. [ 61 ]  The species is kept in captivity in only two places in the world. [ 62 ]     Cultural references   The species' unique life cycle in such a torrid environment has been described in print and visual media.  Apsley Cherry-Garrard , the Antarctic explorer, said: ""Take it all in all, I do not believe anybody on Earth has a worse time than an Emperor Penguin"". [ 63 ]  Widely distributed in cinemas in 2005, the French documentary  La Marche de l'empereur , which was also released with the English title  March of the Penguins , told the story of the penguins' reproductive cycle. [ 62 ] [ 64 ]  The subject has been covered for the small screen twice by the  BBC  and presenter  David Attenborough , first in episode five of the 1993 series on the Antarctic  Life in the Freezer , [ 65 ]  and again in the 2006 series  Planet Earth . [ 66 ]   The computer-animated movie  Happy Feet  (2006) features Emperor Penguins as its primary characters, with one in particular that loves to dance; although a comedy, it too depicts their life cycle and promotes an underlying serious environmental message of threats from global warming and depletion of food sources by overfishing. [ 67 ]  The computer-animated movie  Surf's Up  (2007) features a surfing Emperor Penguin named Zeke ""Big-Z"" Topanga. [ 68 ]  More than 30 countries have depicted the bird on their stamps  Australia, Great Britain, Chile and France have each issued several. [ 69 ]  It has also been depicted on a 1962 10  franc  stamp as part of an Antarctic expedition series. [ 70 ]     Conservation status   The Emperor Penguin is listed as a species of ""least concern"" by the  IUCN . Along with nine other species of penguin, it is currently under consideration for inclusion under the US  Endangered Species Act . The primary reasons for this are declining food availability due to the effects of  climate change  and industrial fisheries on the crustacean and fish populations. Other reasons for their potential placement on this list include disease,  habitat destruction , and disturbance at breeding colonies by humans. Of particular concern is the impact of tourism. [ 71 ]  One study has shown Emperor Penguin chicks in a crche to become more apprehensive following helicopter approach to 1,000 m (3,281 ft). [ 72 ]   Population declines of 50% in the  Terre Adlie  region have been observed due to increased adult mortality, especially of males, during an abnormally prolonged warm period in the late 1970s, which resulted in reduced sea-ice coverage. On the other hand, egg hatching success rates declined when the sea-ice extent increased. The species is therefore considered to be highly sensitive to climatic changes. [ 73 ]   A  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution  study in January 2009 found Emperor Penguins could be pushed to the brink of extinction by the year  2100  due to global climate change. By applying mathematical models to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate warming would affect a big colony of Emperor Penguins at Terre Adlie,  Antartica , they forecast a decline of 87% in the colony's population by the end of the century, from the current 3,000 breeding pairs in the colony to 400 breeding pairs. The decline may be mirrored in the whole Emporer Penguin population, estimated at about 200,000 breeding pairs. [ 74 ]     Notes       ^  BirdLife International (2004).

The 10,000 living species of  birds  have been  classified  as dinosaurs.   The term ""dinosaur"" was coined in 1842 by  Sir Richard Owen  and derives from  Greek     ( deinos ) ""terrible, powerful, wondrous"" +    ( sauros ) ""lizard"". It is sometimes used informally to describe other  prehistoric reptiles , such as the  pelycosaur   Dimetrodon , the winged  pterosaurs , and the aquatic  ichthyosaurs ,  plesiosaurs  and  mosasaurs , although none of these animals were dinosaurs. Through the first half of the 20th century, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been slow, unintelligent  cold-blooded  animals. Most  research conducted since the 1970s , however, has supported the view that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. The resulting transformation in the scientific understanding of dinosaurs has gradually filtered into popular consciousness.   The 1861 discovery of the primitive bird  Archaeopteryx  first suggested a close relationship between dinosaurs and birds. Aside from the presence of fossilized feather impressions,  Archaeopteryx  was very similar to the contemporary small predatory dinosaur  Compsognathus . Research has since identified  theropod  dinosaurs as the most likely direct ancestors of  birds ; most paleontologists today regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs, and some suggest that dinosaurs and birds should be grouped into one biological class. [ 1 ]  Aside from birds,  crocodilians  are the only other close relatives of dinosaurs to have survived until the present day. Like dinosaurs and birds, crocodilians are members of  Archosauria , a group of  reptiles  that first appeared in the very late  Permian  and came to predominate in the mid-Triassic.   Since the first dinosaur  fossils  were recognized in the early  nineteenth century , mounted dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular. They have been featured in best-selling books and films (notably  Jurassic Park ), and new discoveries are regularly covered by the  media .

[ 2 ]  The term is derived from the  Greek  words  ( deinos  meaning ""terrible"", ""powerful"", or ""wondrous"") and  ( saura  meaning ""lizard"" or ""reptile""). [ 3 ]  Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty. [ 4 ]  In colloquial English ""dinosaur"" is sometimes used to describe an obsolete or unsuccessful thing or person, [ 5 ]  despite the dinosaurs' 160 million year reign and the global abundance and diversity of their descendants, the birds.     Modern definition           Triceratops   skeleton  at the  American Museum of Natural History  in New York City.       Under  phylogenetic taxonomy , dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of "" Triceratops ,  Neornithes  [modern birds], their  most recent common ancestor , and all descendants."" [ 6 ]  It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the most recent common ancestor of  Megalosaurus  and  Iguanodon , because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria. [ 7 ]  Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs, including  theropods  (mostly  bipedal   carnivores ),  sauropodomorphs  (mostly large  herbivorous   quadrupeds  with long necks and tails),  ankylosaurians  (armored herbivorous quadrupeds),  stegosaurians  (plated herbivorous quadrupeds),  ceratopsians  (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), and  ornithopods  (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including ""duck-bills""). These definitions are written to correspond with scientific conceptions of dinosaurs that predate the modern use of phylogenetics. The continuity of meaning is intended to prevent confusion about what the term ""dinosaur"" means.   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict  cladistical  definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor must be included in a group for that group to be natural, birds  are  dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup  Maniraptora , which are  coelurosaurs , which are theropods, which are  saurischians , which are dinosaurs. [ 8 ]   From the point of view of cladistics, birds are dinosaurs, but in ordinary speech the word ""dinosaur"" does not include birds. Additionally, referring to dinosaurs that are not birds as ""non-avian dinosaurs"" is cumbersome. For clarity, this article will use ""dinosaur"" as a synonym for ""non-avian dinosaur"". The term ""non-avian dinosaur"" will be used for emphasis as needed. It is also technically correct to refer to dinosaurs as a distinct group under the older  Linnaean classification  system, which accepts  paraphyletic  taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor.     General description           Stegosaurus  skeleton,  Field Museum ,  Chicago .       Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs (aside from birds) can be generally described as terrestrial  archosaurian   reptiles  with  limbs held erect beneath the body , that existed from the  Late Triassic  (first appearing in the  Carnian   faunal stage ) to the  Late Cretaceous  (going extinct at the end of the  Maastrichtian ). [ 9 ]  Many prehistoric animals are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and  Dimetrodon , but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs. Marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs were neither terrestrial nor archosaurs; pterosaurs were archosaurs but not terrestrial; and  Dimetrodon  was a  Permian  animal more closely related to mammals. [ 10 ]  Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the  Jurassic  and Cretaceous. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded the size of a cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey. [ 11 ]  One notable exception is  Repenomamus giganticus , a  triconodont  weighing between 12 kilograms (26 lb) and 14 kilograms (31 lb) that is known to have eaten small dinosaurs like young  Psittacosaurus . [ 12 ]   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1,850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. [ 13 ]  An earlier study predicted that about 3,400 dinosaur genera existed, including many which would not have been preserved in the fossil record. [ 14 ]  As of September 17, 2008, 1,047 different species of dinosaurs have been named. [ 15 ]  Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds, and others, such as  Ammosaurus  and  Iguanodon , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Many had  bony armor , or cranial modifications like horns and crests. Although known for large size, many dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller. Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including  Antarctica . [ 16 ]  No dinosaurs are known to have lived in marine or aerial habitats, although it is possible some feathered theropods were flyers.     Distinguishing features   While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral  archosaurian  skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common features across a taxonomic group are called  synapomorphies .   Dinosaur synapomorphies include an elongated crest on the  humerus , or upper arm bone, to accommodate the attachment of  deltopectoral  muscles; a shelf at the rear of the  ilium , or main hip bone; a  tibia , or shin bone, featuring a broad lower edge and a flange pointing out and to the rear; and an ascending projection on the  astragalus , one of the ankle bones, which secures it to the tibia. [ 17 ]           Edmontonia  was an ""armored dinosaur"" of the group  Ankylosauria .       A variety of other skeletal features were shared by many dinosaurs. However, because they were either common to other groups of  archosaurs  or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as  diapsid  reptiles, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of  temporal fenestrae  (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the  snout  and lower jaw. [ 18 ]  Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated  scapula , or shoulder blade; a  sacrum  composed of three or more fused  vertebrae  (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in  Herrerasaurus ); [ 17 ]  and an  acetabulum , or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in  Saturnalia , for example). [ 19 ]  Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the Late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature. [ 20 ]          Hip joints and hindlimb postures.       Dinosaurs stood erect in a manner similar to  most modern mammals , but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side. [ 21 ]  Their posture was due to the development of a laterally-facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly-facing distinct head on the femur. [ 22 ]  Their erect posture enabled dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that  surpassed those of ""sprawling"" reptiles . [ 23 ]  Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs. [ 24 ]  Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including  rauisuchians , also had erect limbs but achieved this by a ""pillar erect"" configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the  upper pelvic bone  was rotated to form an overhanging shelf. [ 24 ]     Natural history     Origins and early evolution       Main article:  Evolution of dinosaurs               Eoraptor , an early dinosaur genus.       For a long time many scientists thought dinosaurs were  polyphyletic  with multiple groups of unrelated ""dinosaurs"" evolving due to similar pressures, [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  but dinosaurs are now known to have formed a single group. [ 28 ] [ 17 ]   Dinosaurs diverged from their  archosaur  ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late  Triassic  period, roughly 20 million years after the  Permian-Triassic extinction event  wiped out an estimated 95% of all  life on Earth . [ 29 ] [ 30 ]   Radiometric dating  of the  rock formation  that contained fossils from the early dinosaur  genus   Eoraptor  establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists believe  Eoraptor  resembles the  common ancestor  of all dinosaurs; [ 31 ]  if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal  predators . [ 32 ]  The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like  ornithodirans  such as  Marasuchus  and  Lagerpeton  in  Argentinian   Middle Triassic  strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.   When dinosaurs appeared, terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of basal archosaurs and  therapsids , such as  aetosaurs ,  cynodonts ,  dicynodonts ,  ornithosuchids ,  rauisuchias , and  rhynchosaurs . Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, in one of two events. First, at about the boundary between the  Carnian  and  Norian   faunal stages  (about 215 million years ago), dicynodonts and a variety of basal  archosauromorphs , including the  prolacertiforms  and rhynchosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the  Triassic-Jurassic extinction event  (about 200 million years ago), that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids,  phytosaurs , and rauisuchians. These losses left behind a land fauna of  crocodylomorphs , dinosaurs,  mammals ,  pterosaurians , and  turtles . [ 17 ]   The first few lines of primitive dinosaurs  diversified  through the  Carnian  and  Norian   stages  of the Triassic, most likely by occupying the niches of groups that became extinct. Traditionally, dinosaurs were thought to have  replaced  the variety of other Triassic land animals by proving superior through a long period of competition. This now appears unlikely, for several reasons. Dinosaurs do not show a pattern of steadily increasing in diversity and numbers, as would be predicted if they were competitively replacing other groups; instead, they were very rare through the Carnian, making up only 1-2% of individuals present in  faunas . In the Norian, however, after the extinction of several other groups, they became significant components of faunas, representing 50-90% of individuals. Also, what had been viewed as a key adaptation of dinosaurs, their erect stance, is now known to have present in several contemporaneous groups that were not as successful (aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, rauisuchians, and some groups of crocodylomorphs). Finally, the Late Triassic itself was a time of great upheaval in life, with shifts in plant life, marine life, and climate. [ 17 ]   Crurotarsans , today represented only by crocodilians but in the Late Triassic also encompassing such now-extinct groups as aetosaurs, phytosaurs, ornithosuchians, and rauisuchians, were actually more diverse in the Late Triassic than dinosaurs, indicating that the survival of dinosaurs had more to do with luck than superiority. [ 33 ]     Low diversification in the Cretaceous   Statistical analyses based on raw data suggest that dinosaurs diversified, i.e. the number of species increased, in the Late  Cretaceous . However in July 2008 Graeme T. Lloyd  et al.  argued that this apparent diversification was an illusion caused by  sampling bias , because Late Cretaceous rocks have been very heavily studied. Instead, they wrote, dinosaurs underwent only two significant diversifications in the Late Cretaceous, the initial  radiations  of the  euhadrosaurs  and  ceratopsians . In the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previous been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites  (fossilized dung) indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Meanwhile  herbivorous  insects and  mammals  diversified rapidly to take advantage of the new type of plant food, while lizards, snakes,  crocodilians  and  birds  also diversified at the same time. Lloyd  et al.  suggest that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Classification       Main article:  Dinosaur classification       Dinosaurs (including birds) are  archosaurs , like modern  crocodilians . Archosaurs'  diapsid  skulls have two holes, called  temporal fenestrae , located where the jaw muscles attach, and an additional  antorbital fenestra  in front of the eyes. Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called  synapsids ; and  turtles , with no temporal fenestra, are  anapsids . Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side.   Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a  superorder  or an unranked  clade . They are divided into two  orders ,  Saurischia  and  Ornithischia , depending upon  pelvic  structure. Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with  birds  than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all  taxa  sharing a more recent common ancestor with  Triceratops  than with Saurischia. Saurischians ('lizard-hipped', from the  Greek   sauros  (  ) meaning 'lizard' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') retained the hip structure of their ancestors, with a  pubis  bone directed  cranially , or forward. [ 22 ]  This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups ( Herrerasaurus , [ 35 ]   therizinosauroids , [ 36 ]   dromaeosaurids , [ 37 ]  and  birds [ 8 ] ). Saurischia includes the  theropods  (bipedal and mostly carnivores, except for birds) and  sauropodomorphs  (long-necked quadrupedal  herbivores ).   By contrast, ornithischians ('bird-hipped', from the  Greek   ornitheios  (  ) meaning 'of a bird' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird's pelvis: the  pubis  bone was oriented  caudally  (rear-pointing). Unlike birds, the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward-pointing process. Ornithischia includes a variety of herbivores. ( NB:  the terms ""lizard hip"" and ""bird-hip"" are misnomers  birds evolved from dinosaurs with ""lizard hips"".)

In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass  Pangaea , there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of  coelophysoid   carnivores  and  prosauropod   herbivores . [ 38 ]   Gymnosperm  plants (particularly  conifers ), a potential food source, radiated in the Late Triassic. Prosauropods did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. [ 39 ]  The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of  ceratosaurians ,  spinosauroids , and  carnosaurians , and herbivores consisting of  stegosaurian  ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the  Morrison Formation  of North America and  Tendaguru Beds  of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized  sinraptorid  theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like  Mamenchisaurus . [ 38 ]   Ankylosaurians  and  ornithopods  were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and  pteridophytes  were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential  cheek -like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. [ 39 ]  Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians . [ 8 ]          An Illustration of 18 species of basal ceratopsia to scale.       By the Early Cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians,  iguanodontians , and  brachiosaurids  through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large  spinosaurid  and  carcharodontosaurid  theropods, and  rebbachisaurid  and  titanosaurian  sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia,  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians  like  dromaeosaurids ,  troodontids , and  oviraptorosaurians  became the common theropods, and  ankylosaurids  and early  ceratopsians  like  Psittacosaurus  became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians,  hypsilophodonts , and iguanodontians. [ 38 ]  The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early Late Cretaceous. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of  flowering plants . At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries, taken to its extreme in  hadrosaurids . [ 39 ]  Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid  Nigersaurus . [ 40 ]   There were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were  tyrannosaurids  and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and  pachycephalosaurians . In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting  Gondwana ,  abelisaurids  were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids,  rhabdodontid  iguanodontians,  nodosaurid  ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent. [ 38 ]  Flowering plants were greatly radiating, [ 39 ]  with the first grasses appearing by the end of the Cretaceous. [ 41 ]  Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia. Theropods were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores, with  therizinosaurians  and  ornithomimosaurians  becoming common. [ 39 ]   The  CretaceousTertiary extinction event , which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the birds. Some other  diapsid  groups, such as crocodylians,  lizards ,  snakes ,  sphenodontians , and  choristoderans , also survived the event. [ 42 ]     Paleobiology   Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil records, including  fossilized   bones ,  feces ,  trackways ,  gastroliths ,  feathers , impressions of skin,  internal organs  and  soft tissues . [ 43 ] [ 44 ]  Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including  physics  (especially  biomechanics ),  chemistry ,  biology , and the  earth sciences  (of which  paleontology  is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.     Size       Main article:  Dinosaur size              Scale diagram comparing the largest known dinosaurs in four  suborders  and a human.       While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the  sauropods  were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an  order of magnitude  more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric  mammals  such as the  Indricotherium  and the Columbian  mammoth  were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach or surpass them in size  most notably the  blue whale , which reaches up to 173,000 kilograms (381,000 lb) and over 30 meters (100 ft) in length. [ 45 ]  There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but it may be that the most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in  rock formations  interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments. [ 46 ]   Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. [ 31 ]  Theropod dinosaurs, when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on  order of magnitude , most often fall into the 100 to 1,000 kilogram (220 to 2,200 lb) category, whereas  recent  predatory  carnivorans  peak in the 10 to 100 kilogram (22 to 220 lb) category. [ 47 ]  The  mode  of dinosaur body masses is between one and ten metric tonnes. [ 48 ]  This contrasts sharply with the size of  Cenozoic  mammals, estimated by the  National Museum of Natural History  as about 2 to 5 kilograms (5 to 10 lb). [ 49 ]     Largest and smallest   Only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the  largest and smallest dinosaurs .          Comparative size of  Brachiosaurus .       The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is  Brachiosaurus brancai  (also known as  Giraffatitan ). Its remains were discovered in  Tanzania  between 190712. Bones from multiple similarly-sized individuals were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the  Humboldt Museum  of  Berlin ; [ 50 ]  this mount is 12 meters (39 ft) tall and 22.5 meters (74 ft) long, and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between 30,000 and 60,000 kilograms (70,000 and 130,000 lb). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 m (89 ft) long  Diplodocus , which was discovered in  Wyoming  in the  United States  and displayed in  Pittsburgh's   Carnegie Natural History Museum  in 1907.          Comparative size of  Eoraptor .       There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils. Most of the largest  herbivorous  specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive  Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed 80,000 to 100,000 kilograms (90 to 110 short tons); some of the longest, the 33.5 meters (110 ft) long  Diplodocus hallorum [ 46 ]  (formerly  Seismosaurus ) and the 33 meters (110 ft) long  Supersaurus ; [ 51 ]  and the tallest, the 18 meters (59 ft)  Sauroposeidon , which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The longest of them all may have been  Amphicoelias fragillimus , known only from a now lost partial vertebral  neural arch  described in 1878. Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone, the animal may have been 58 meters (190 ft) long and weighed over 120,000 kilograms (260,000 lb), [ 46 ]  heavier than all known dinosaurs except possibly the poorly known  Bruhathkayosaurus , which could have weighed 175,000 to 220,000 kilograms (400,000 to 500,000 lb). The largest known  carnivorous  dinosaur was  Spinosaurus , reaching a length of 16 to 18 meters (50 to 60 ft), and weighing in at 8,150 kilograms (18,000 lb). [ 52 ]  Other large meat-eaters included  Giganotosaurus ,  Mapusaurus ,  Tyrannosaurus rex  and  Carcharodontosaurus .   Not including modern birds, the smallest dinosaurs known were about the size of a  pigeon . [ 53 ]  The theropods  Anchiornis  and  Epidexipteryx  both had a total skeletal length of under 35 centimeters (1.1 ft). [ 54 ] [ 53 ]   Anchiornis  is currently the smallest dinosaur described from an adult specimen, with an estimated weight of 110 grams. [ 54 ]  The smallest herbivorous dinosaurs included  Microceratus  and  Wannanosaurus , at about 60 cm long (2 ft) each. [ 55 ] [ 56 ]     Behavior          A nesting ground of  Maiasaura  was discovered in 1978.       Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their  habitat ,  computer simulations  of their  biomechanics , and comparisons with modern animals in similar  ecological niches . As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.   The first potential evidence of  herding  behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31  Iguanodon  dinosaurs which were then thought to have perished together in  Bernissart ,  Belgium , after they fell into a deep, flooded  sinkhole  and drowned. [ 57 ]  Other mass death sites have been subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that  duck-bills  (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the  American Bison  or the African  Springbok . Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in  Oxfordshire , England, [ 58 ]  although there is not evidence for specific herd structures. [ 59 ]  Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for  migratory  purposes, or to provide protection for their young. There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in  Inner Mongolia  that has yielded the remains of over twenty  Sinornithomimus , from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud. [ 60 ]  The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as  pack hunters  working together to bring down large prey. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  However, this lifestyle is uncommon among the modern relatives of dinosaurs ( crocodiles  and other reptiles, and  birds  -  Harris's Hawk  is a well-documented exception), and the  taphonomic  evidence suggesting pack hunting in such theropods as  Deinonychus  and  Allosaurus  can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern  diapsid  predators. [ 63 ]          Fossilized egg of the  oviraptorid   Citipati ,  American Museum of Natural History .       Jack Horner's  1978 discovery of a  Maiasaura  (""good mother dinosaur"")  nesting  ground in  Montana  demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the  ornithopods . [ 64 ]  There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like  Patagonian   titanosaurian  sauropods (1997 discovery), also nested in large groups. [ 65 ]  The  Mongolian   oviraptorid   Citipati  was discovered in a  chicken -like  brooding  position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the  eggs  warm. [ 66 ]  Parental care is also implied by other finds. For example, the fossilized remains of a grouping of  Psittacosaurus  has been found, consisting of one adult and 34 juveniles; in this case, the large number of juveniles may be due to communal nesting. [ 67 ]  Additionally, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the  prosauropod   Massospondylus ) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur. [ 68 ]  Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the  Isle of Skye  in northwestern  Scotland . [ 69 ]  Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.          Artist's rendering of two  Centrosaurus , herbivorous  ceratopsid  dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous fauna of North America.       The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the  marginocephalians ,  theropods  and  lambeosaurines , may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and  territorialism . Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations. [ 70 ]  The nature of dinosaur  communication  also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent studies suggest that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as  resonance chambers  used for a wide range of  vocalizations . [ 71 ] [ 72 ]   From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the  Gobi Desert  in 1971. It included a  Velociraptor  attacking a  Protoceratops , [ 73 ]  providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. [ 74 ]  Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially-healed tail of an  Edmontosaurus , a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. [ 74 ]   Cannibalism  amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod  Majungasaurus . [ 75 ]   Based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as  Oryctodromeus , some herbivorous species seem to have led a partially  fossorial  (burrowing) lifestyle, [ 76 ]  and some bird-like species may have been  arboreal  (tree-climbing), most notably primitive  dromaeosaurids  such as  Microraptor [ 77 ]  and the enigmatic  scansoriopterygids . [ 78 ]  However, most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of  biomechanics , in particular, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, [ 79 ]  whether  diplodocids  could create  sonic booms  via  whip -like tail snapping, [ 80 ]  and whether sauropods could float. [ 81 ]     Physiology       Main article:  Physiology of dinosaurs               Tyrannosaurus rex  skull and upper vertebral column, Palais de la Dcouverte, Paris.       A vigorous debate on the subject of temperature regulation in dinosaurs has been ongoing since the 1960s. Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur  endotherm  has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation.   After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were  ectothermic  creatures: ""terrible  lizards "" as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness implied that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, comparable to modern reptiles, which need external sources of heat in order to regulate their body temperature. Dinosaur ectothermy remained a prevalent view until  Robert T. ""Bob"" Bakker , an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968.   Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (perhaps aided by the animals' bulk). Evidence of  endotherm  in dinosaurs includes the discovery of  polar dinosaurs in Australia  and  Antarctica  (where they would have experienced a cold, dark six-month winter), the discovery of dinosaurs whose feathers may have provided regulatory insulation, and analysis of blood-vessel structures that are typical of endotherms within dinosaur bone. Skeletal structures suggest that theropods and other dinosaurs had active lifestyles better suited to an endothermic cardiovascular system, while sauropods exhibit fewer endothermic characteristics. It is certainly possible that some dinosaurs were endothermic while others were not. Scientific debate over the specifics continues. [ 82 ]           Eubrontes , a dinosaur footprint in the Lower  Jurassic  Moenave Formation at the St. George Dinosaur Discovery Site at Johnson Farm, southwestern Utah.       Complicating the debate is the fact that warm-bloodedness can emerge based on more than one mechanism. Most discussions of dinosaur endothermy tend to compare them to average birds or mammals, which expend energy to elevate body temperature above that of the environment. Small birds and mammals also possess  insulation , such as  fat ,  fur , or  feathers , which slows down heat loss. However, large mammals, such as elephants, face a different problem because of their relatively small ratio of surface area to volume ( Haldane's  principle). This ratio compares the volume of an animal with the area of its skin: as an animal gets bigger, its surface area increases more slowly than its volume. At a certain point, the amount of heat radiated away through the skin drops below the amount of heat produced inside the body, forcing animals to use additional methods to avoid overheating. In the case of elephants, they have little hair as adults, and have large ears which increase their surface area, and have behavioral adaptations as well (such as using the trunk to spray water on themselves and mud wallowing). These behaviors increase cooling through evaporation.   Large dinosaurs would presumably have had to deal with similar issues; their body size suggest they lost heat relatively slowly to the surrounding air, and so could have been what are called  inertial homeotherms , animals that are warmer than their environments through sheer size rather than through special adaptations like those of birds or mammals. However, so far this theory fails to account for the numerous dog- and goat-sized dinosaur species, or the young of larger species.   Modern  computerized tomography  (CT) scans of a  dinosaur 's chest cavity (conducted in 2000) found the apparent remnants of a four-chambered heart, much like those found in today's mammals and birds. [ 83 ]  The idea is controversial within the scientific community, coming under fire for bad anatomical science [ 84 ]  or simply wishful thinking. [ 85 ]  The question of how this find reflects on metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy may be moot, though, regardless of the object's identity: both modern  crocodilians  and  birds , the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well. [ 86 ]     Soft tissue and DNA           Scipionyx samniticus  fossil showing tissue impressions, at the  Museo Civico di Storia Naturale , in Milan, Italy.       One of the best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in  Petraroia ,  Italy . The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young  coelurosaur ,  Scipionyx  samniticus . The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur. [ 43 ]   In the March 2005 issue of  Science , the paleontologist  Mary Higby Schweitzer  and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old  Tyrannosaurus rex  leg  bone  from the  Hell Creek Formation  in  Montana . After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team. [ 44 ]   When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as  blood vessels , bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear; study and interpretation of the material is ongoing. [ 44 ]   Newer research, published in PloS One (30 July 2008), has challenged the claims that the material found is the soft tissue of  Tyrannosaurus . Thomas Kaye of the  University of Washington  and his co-authors contend that what was really inside the tyrannosaur bone was slimy  biofilm  created by bacteria that coated the voids once occupied by blood vessels and cells. [ 87 ]  The researchers found that what previously had been identified as remnants of blood cells, because of the presence of iron, were actually  framboids , microscopic mineral spheres bearing iron. They found similar spheres in a variety of other fossils from various periods, including an  ammonite . In the ammonite they found the spheres in a place where the iron they contain could not have had any relationship to the presence of blood. [ 88 ]   The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions, but upon further inspection and  peer review , neither of these reports could be confirmed. [ 89 ]  However, a functional visual  peptide  of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds. [ 90 ]  In addition, several  proteins  have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils, [ 91 ]  including hemoglobin. [ 92 ]   Even if dinosaur DNA could be reconstructed, it would be exceedingly difficult to clone and ""grow"" dinosaurs using current technology since no closely related species exist to provide  zygotes  or a suitable environment for  embryonic development .     Feathers and the origin of birds       Main article:  Origin of birds       The possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by  Thomas Henry Huxley . [ 93 ]  After the work of  Gerhard Heilmann  in the early 20th century, the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of generalized  thecodont  ancestors, with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of  clavicles  in dinosaurs. [ 94 ]  However, as later discoveries showed, clavicles (or a single fused  wishbone , which derived from separate clavicles) were not actually absent; [ 8 ]  they had been found as early as 1924 in  Oviraptor , but misidentified as an  interclavicle . [ 95 ]  In the 1970s,  John Ostrom  revived the dinosaur-bird theory, [ 96 ]  which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis, [ 97 ]  and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds. [ 18 ]  Of particular note has been the fossils of the  Yixian Formation , where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found, often with feathers of some type. [ 8 ]  Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives. [ 98 ]  They are most closely allied with  maniraptoran  coelurosaurs. [ 8 ]  A minority of scientists, most notably  Alan Feduccia  and  Larry Martin , have proposed other evolutionary paths, including revised versions of Heilmann's basal archosaur proposal, [ 99 ]  or that maniraptoran theropods are the ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs, only  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ]     Feathers       Main article:  Feathered dinosaurs              The famous Berlin Specimen of  Archaeopteryx lithographica .       Archaeopteryx , the first good example of a ""feathered dinosaur"", was discovered in 1861. The initial specimen was found in the  Solnhofen limestone  in southern Germany, which is a  lagersttte , a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils.  Archaeopteryx  is a  transitional fossil , with features clearly intermediate between those of modern reptiles and birds. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal  The Origin of Species , its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of  evolutionary biology  and  creationism . This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for  Compsognathus . [ 101 ]   Since the 1990s, a number of additional  feathered dinosaurs  have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the  lagersttte  of the Yixian Formation,  Liaoning , northeastern  China , which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found only in a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be due to the fact that delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by  fossilization  and thus are absent from the fossil record. To this point, protofeathers (thin, filament-like structures) are known from dinosaurs at the base of Coelurosauria, such as  compsognathids  like  Sinosauropteryx  and  tyrannosauroids  ( Dilong ), [ 102 ]  but barbed feathers are only known among the coelurosaur subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. [ 8 ] [ 103 ]  The description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that protofeathers are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' integument, [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with barbed feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ] [ 105 ]  However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the question of the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been raised. [ 107 ]     Skeleton   Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the  missing link  between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for  paleontologists . Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck,  pubis ,  wrist  (semi-lunate  carpal ), arm and  pectoral girdle , furcula (wishbone), and  breast bone . Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through  cladistic analysis  strengthens the case for the link.     Soft anatomy   Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation which was led by  Patrick O'Connor  of  Ohio University . The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their  skeletons , as is the case in birds. ""What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds"", O'Connor said. [ 108 ]  In a paper published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE (September 29, 2008), scientists described  Aerosteon riocoloradensis , the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like breathing system.  CT-scanning  revealed the evidence of air sacs within the body cavity of the  Aerosteon  skeleton. [ 109 ] [ 110 ]   Another piece of evidence that birds and dinosaurs are closely related is the use of  gizzard  stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with  fossils , gizzard stones are called  gastroliths . [ 111 ]     Reproductive biology   A discovery of features in a  Tyrannosaurus rex   skeleton  recently provided more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs between the hard outer bone and the  marrow . This  medullary  bone, which is rich in  calcium , is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally-derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the  Tyrannosaurus rex  specimen's hind limb suggested that  T. rex  used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female. [ 112 ]  Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod  Allosaurus  and ornithopod  Tenontosaurus . Because the line of dinosaurs that includes  Allosaurus  and  Tyrannosaurus  diverged from the line that led to  Tenontosaurus  very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue. Medullary bone has been found in specimens of sub-adult size, which suggests that dinosaurs reached sexual maturity rather quickly for such large animals. [ 113 ]     Behavioral evidence   A recently discovered  troodont  fossil demonstrates that some dinosaurs slept like certain modern birds, with their heads tucked under their arms. [ 114 ]  This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds.     Extinction       Main articles:  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  and  KT boundary       Non-avian dinosaurs suddenly became  extinct  approximately 65 million years ago. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including  ammonites  ( nautilus -like  mollusks ),  mosasaurs , plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, herbivorous  turtles  and  crocodiles , most birds, and many groups of mammals. [ 16 ]  This  mass extinction  is known as the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event . The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the general consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.   At the peak of the Mesozoic, there were no  polar ice caps , and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250 meters (300 to 800 ft) higher than they are today. The planet's temperature was also much more uniform, with only 25  C  (45  F ) separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator. On average, atmospheric temperatures were also much warmer; the poles, for example, were 50 C (90 F) warmer than today. [ 115 ] [ 116 ]   The atmosphere's composition during the Mesozoic was vastly different as well. Carbon dioxide levels were up to 12 times higher than today's levels, and oxygen formed 32 to 35% of the atmosphere, as compared to 21% today. However, by the late Cretaceous, the environment was changing dramatically. Volcanic activity was decreasing, which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably. Some scientists hypothesize that climate change, combined with lower oxygen levels, might have led directly to the demise of many species. If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds, it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency, given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies. [ 16 ]     Impact event       Main article:  Chicxulub crater              The  Chicxulub Crater  at the tip of the  Yucatn Peninsula ; the impactor that formed this crater may have caused the dinosaur extinction.       The asteroid collision theory, which was brought to wide attention in 1980 by  Walter Alvarez  and colleagues, links the  extinction event  at the end of the Cretaceous period to a  bolide  impact approximately 65.5 million years ago. Alvarez  et al.  proposed that a sudden increase in  iridium  levels, recorded around the world in the period's rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. [ 117 ]  The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a 5 to 15 kilometer (3 to 9 mi) wide  bolide  hit in the vicinity of the  Yucatn Peninsula , creating the 170 kilometers (110 mi) wide  Chicxulub Crater  and triggering the  mass extinction . [ 118 ]  Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the  impact event . Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave.   Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun).   In September 2007, U.S. researchers led by  William Bottke  of the  Southwest Research Institute  in  Boulder, Colorado , and  Czech  scientists used  computer  simulations to identify the probable source of the Chicxulub impact. They calculated a 90% probability that a giant asteroid named  Baptistina , approximately 160 kilometers (100 mi) in diameter, orbiting in the asteroid belt which lies between  Mars  and  Jupiter , was struck by a smaller unnamed asteroid about 55 kilometers (35 mi) in diameter about 160 million years ago. The impact shattered Baptistina, creating a cluster which still exists today as the  Baptistina family . Calculations indicate that some of the fragments were sent hurtling into earth-crossing orbits, one of which was the 10 kilometers (6 mi) wide  meteorite  which struck  Mexico 's  Yucatan   peninsula  65 million years ago, creating the  Chicxulub crater  (175 kilometers (110 mi)). [ 119 ]   While similar to Alvarez's impact theory (which involved a single asteroid or comet), this theory proposes that ""passages of the  solar companion star Nemesis  through the  Oort comet cloud  would trigger comet showers."" [ 120 ]  One or more of these objects then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time, causing the worldwide extinction. As with the impact of a single asteroid, the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures, followed by a protracted cool period. [ 120 ]     Deccan Traps       Main article:  Deccan Traps       Before 2000, arguments that the  Deccan Traps   flood basalts  caused the  extinction  were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 mya and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two-thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in 1 million years about 65.5 mya, so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly a period of thousands of years, but still a longer period than what would be expected from a single impact event. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulphuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reducing photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the  greenhouse effect  when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere. [ 122 ]  Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of  volcanic gasses  during the formation of the  Deccan traps  ""contributed to an apparently massive  global warming . Some data point to an average rise in temperature of 8 C (14 F) in the last half million years before the  impact [at Chicxulub] ."" [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction,  Luis Alvarez  (who died in 1988) replied that  paleontologists  were being misled by  sparse data . While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in  sea level  and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions. [ 123 ]     Failure to adapt to changing conditions   Lloyd  et al.  (2008) noted that, in the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previously been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites   fossilized dung  indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Statistical analysis by Lloyd  et al.  concluded that, contrary to earlier studies, dinosaurs did not diversify very much in the Late Cretaceous. Lloyd  et al.  suggested that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Possible Paleocene survivors   Nonavian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the  K-T boundary . In 2002, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single  hadrosaur  leg bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico and described it as evidence of  Paleocene dinosaurs . The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early  Paleocene  epoch approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that  stratum  by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era. [ 124 ]  Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the  Hell Creek Formation  up to 1.3 meters (51 in) above (40,000 years later than) the K-T boundary. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China. [ 125 ]  Many scientists, however, dismiss the ""Paleocene dinosaurs"" as re-worked, i.e. washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments, [ 126 ] [ 127 ]  or find that, if correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction. [ 126 ]     History of discovery   Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese, whose modern word for dinosaur is  konglong  (, or ""terrible dragon""), considered them to be  dragon   bones  and documented them as such. For example,  Hua Yang Guo Zhi , a book written by Zhang Qu during the  Western Jin Dynasty , reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in  Sichuan  Province. [ 128 ]  Villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized ""dragon bones"" for use in traditional medicines, a practice that continues today. [ 129 ]  In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of  giants  and other creatures killed by the  Great Flood .   Scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in  England . Part of a bone, now known to have been the  femur  of a  Megalosaurus , [ 130 ]  was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near  Chipping Norton ,  Oxfordshire , England in 1676. The fragment was sent to  Robert Plot , Professor of Chemistry at the  University of Oxford  and first curator of the  Ashmolean Museum , who published a description in his  Natural History of Oxfordshire  in 1677. He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the  femur  of a large animal, but recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species. He therefore concluded it to be the thigh bone of a giant human similar to those mentioned in the  Bible . In 1699,  Edward Lhuyd , a friend of  Sir Isaac Newton , was responsible for the first published scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a  sauropod   tooth , "" Rutellum implicatum "" [ 131 ] [ 132 ] , that had been found in Caswell, near Whitney, Oxfordshire. [ 133 ]           William Buckland .       Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev  William Buckland , a professor of  geology  at  Oxford University , collected more fossilized bones of  Megalosaurus  and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a  scientific journal . [ 134 ] [ 130 ]  The second dinosaur genus to be identified,  Iguanodon , was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell - the wife of English geologist  Gideon Mantell . Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between  his fossils  and the bones of modern  iguanas . He published his findings in 1825. [ 135 ] [ 136 ]   The study of these ""great fossil lizards"" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist  Richard Owen  coined the term ""dinosaur"". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far,  Iguanodon ,  Megalosaurus  and  Hylaeosaurus , shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of  Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha , the husband of  Queen Victoria , Owen established the  Natural History Museum  in  South Kensington ,  London , to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.   In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in  marl  pits in the small town of  Haddonfield, New Jersey  (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named  Hadrosaurus  foulkii . It was an extremely important find;  Hadrosaurus  was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found and it was clearly a  bipedal  creature. ( The first  was in 1834, in Maidstone, Kent, England) This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the  United States .           Othniel Charles Marsh , 19th century photograph.               Edward Drinker Cope , 19th century photograph.       Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Othniel Charles Marsh , both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the  Bone Wars . The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an  Elasmosaurus  skeleton was flawed; Cope had inadvertently placed the  plesiosaur 's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the  US Geological Survey . Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods; for example, their diggers often used  dynamite  to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast; Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, for a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the  American Museum of Natural History  in  New York , while Marsh's is on display at the  Peabody Museum of Natural History  at  Yale University . [ 137 ]   Since 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils has extended to every continent, including  Antarctica . The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the  ankylosaurid   Antarctopelta oliveroi , was found on  Ross Island  in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod  Cryolophosaurus ellioti , was formally named and described in a scientific journal.   Current dinosaur ""hot spots"" include southern South America (especially  Argentina ) and  China . China in particular has produced many exceptional  feathered dinosaur  specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to  fossilization .     The ""dinosaur renaissance""       Main article:  Dinosaur renaissance       The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by  John Ostrom 's discovery of  Deinonychus , an active predator that may have been  warm-blooded , in marked contrast to the then-prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and  cold-blooded .  Vertebrate paleontology  has become a global  science . Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including  India , South America,  Madagascar ,  Antarctica , and most significantly in  China  (the amazingly well-preserved  feathered dinosaurs  in  China  have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of  cladistics , which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in  classifying  dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary  fossil record .     Cultural depictions       Main article:  Cultural depictions of dinosaurs              A  Megalosaurus  stalks  Crystal Palace Park  in  London .       By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word ""dinosaur"" into the common  vernacular  reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, ""dinosaur"" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, slow-moving, obsolete, or bound for extinction. [ 138 ]   Public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in  Victorian  England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, the famous  dinosaur sculptures  were unveiled in  London 's  Crystal Palace Park . The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and  museums  around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way. [ 139 ]  Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the  Bone Wars  of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions. [ 140 ]   The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in  literature ,  film  and other  media . Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in  Charles Dickens'   Bleak House , [ 141 ]  dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of  fictional  works.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's 1912 book  The Lost World , the iconic 1933  film   King Kong , 1954's  Godzilla  and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel  Jurassic Park  by  Michael Crichton  and its 1993  film adaptation  are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest  non-fictional  works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in  advertising ; numerous  companies  have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted or obsolete. [ 142 ]     Religious views       Main article:  Young Earth Creationism#Palaeontology and dinosaurs       Various religious groups have views about dinosaurs that differ from those held by the vast majority of scientists, usually due to conflicts with  creation stories  in their scriptures. However, most of the  scientific  community rejects these religiously-inspired interpretations of dinosaurs.

The 10,000 living species of  birds  have been  classified  as dinosaurs.   The term ""dinosaur"" was coined in 1842 by  Sir Richard Owen  and derives from  Greek     ( deinos ) ""terrible, powerful, wondrous"" +    ( sauros ) ""lizard"". It is sometimes used informally to describe other  prehistoric reptiles , such as the  pelycosaur   Dimetrodon , the winged  pterosaurs , and the aquatic  ichthyosaurs ,  plesiosaurs  and  mosasaurs , although none of these animals were dinosaurs. Through the first half of the 20th century, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been slow, unintelligent  cold-blooded  animals. Most  research conducted since the 1970s , however, has supported the view that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. The resulting transformation in the scientific understanding of dinosaurs has gradually filtered into popular consciousness.   The 1861 discovery of the primitive bird  Archaeopteryx  first suggested a close relationship between dinosaurs and birds. Aside from the presence of fossilized feather impressions,  Archaeopteryx  was very similar to the contemporary small predatory dinosaur  Compsognathus . Research has since identified  theropod  dinosaurs as the most likely direct ancestors of  birds ; most paleontologists today regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs, and some suggest that dinosaurs and birds should be grouped into one biological class. [ 1 ]  Aside from birds,  crocodilians  are the only other close relatives of dinosaurs to have survived until the present day. Like dinosaurs and birds, crocodilians are members of  Archosauria , a group of  reptiles  that first appeared in the very late  Permian  and came to predominate in the mid-Triassic.   Since the first dinosaur  fossils  were recognized in the early  nineteenth century , mounted dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular. They have been featured in best-selling books and films (notably  Jurassic Park ), and new discoveries are regularly covered by the  media .

[ 2 ]  The term is derived from the  Greek  words  ( deinos  meaning ""terrible"", ""powerful"", or ""wondrous"") and  ( saura  meaning ""lizard"" or ""reptile""). [ 3 ]  Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty. [ 4 ]  In colloquial English ""dinosaur"" is sometimes used to describe an obsolete or unsuccessful thing or person, [ 5 ]  despite the dinosaurs' 160 million year reign and the global abundance and diversity of their descendants, the birds.     Modern definition           Triceratops   skeleton  at the  American Museum of Natural History  in New York City.       Under  phylogenetic taxonomy , dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of "" Triceratops ,  Neornithes  [modern birds], their  most recent common ancestor , and all descendants."" [ 6 ]  It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the most recent common ancestor of  Megalosaurus  and  Iguanodon , because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria. [ 7 ]  Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs, including  theropods  (mostly  bipedal   carnivores ),  sauropodomorphs  (mostly large  herbivorous   quadrupeds  with long necks and tails),  ankylosaurians  (armored herbivorous quadrupeds),  stegosaurians  (plated herbivorous quadrupeds),  ceratopsians  (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), and  ornithopods  (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including ""duck-bills""). These definitions are written to correspond with scientific conceptions of dinosaurs that predate the modern use of phylogenetics. The continuity of meaning is intended to prevent confusion about what the term ""dinosaur"" means.   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict  cladistical  definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor must be included in a group for that group to be natural, birds  are  dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup  Maniraptora , which are  coelurosaurs , which are theropods, which are  saurischians , which are dinosaurs. [ 8 ]   From the point of view of cladistics, birds are dinosaurs, but in ordinary speech the word ""dinosaur"" does not include birds. Additionally, referring to dinosaurs that are not birds as ""non-avian dinosaurs"" is cumbersome. For clarity, this article will use ""dinosaur"" as a synonym for ""non-avian dinosaur"". The term ""non-avian dinosaur"" will be used for emphasis as needed. It is also technically correct to refer to dinosaurs as a distinct group under the older  Linnaean classification  system, which accepts  paraphyletic  taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor.     General description           Stegosaurus  skeleton,  Field Museum ,  Chicago .       Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs (aside from birds) can be generally described as terrestrial  archosaurian   reptiles  with  limbs held erect beneath the body , that existed from the  Late Triassic  (first appearing in the  Carnian   faunal stage ) to the  Late Cretaceous  (going extinct at the end of the  Maastrichtian ). [ 9 ]  Many prehistoric animals are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and  Dimetrodon , but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs. Marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs were neither terrestrial nor archosaurs; pterosaurs were archosaurs but not terrestrial; and  Dimetrodon  was a  Permian  animal more closely related to mammals. [ 10 ]  Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the  Jurassic  and Cretaceous. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded the size of a cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey. [ 11 ]  One notable exception is  Repenomamus giganticus , a  triconodont  weighing between 12 kilograms (26 lb) and 14 kilograms (31 lb) that is known to have eaten small dinosaurs like young  Psittacosaurus . [ 12 ]   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1,850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. [ 13 ]  An earlier study predicted that about 3,400 dinosaur genera existed, including many which would not have been preserved in the fossil record. [ 14 ]  As of September 17, 2008, 1,047 different species of dinosaurs have been named. [ 15 ]  Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds, and others, such as  Ammosaurus  and  Iguanodon , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Many had  bony armor , or cranial modifications like horns and crests. Although known for large size, many dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller. Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including  Antarctica . [ 16 ]  No dinosaurs are known to have lived in marine or aerial habitats, although it is possible some feathered theropods were flyers.     Distinguishing features   While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral  archosaurian  skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common features across a taxonomic group are called  synapomorphies .   Dinosaur synapomorphies include an elongated crest on the  humerus , or upper arm bone, to accommodate the attachment of  deltopectoral  muscles; a shelf at the rear of the  ilium , or main hip bone; a  tibia , or shin bone, featuring a broad lower edge and a flange pointing out and to the rear; and an ascending projection on the  astragalus , one of the ankle bones, which secures it to the tibia. [ 17 ]           Edmontonia  was an ""armored dinosaur"" of the group  Ankylosauria .       A variety of other skeletal features were shared by many dinosaurs. However, because they were either common to other groups of  archosaurs  or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as  diapsid  reptiles, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of  temporal fenestrae  (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the  snout  and lower jaw. [ 18 ]  Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated  scapula , or shoulder blade; a  sacrum  composed of three or more fused  vertebrae  (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in  Herrerasaurus ); [ 17 ]  and an  acetabulum , or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in  Saturnalia , for example). [ 19 ]  Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the Late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature. [ 20 ]          Hip joints and hindlimb postures.       Dinosaurs stood erect in a manner similar to  most modern mammals , but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side. [ 21 ]  Their posture was due to the development of a laterally-facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly-facing distinct head on the femur. [ 22 ]  Their erect posture enabled dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that  surpassed those of ""sprawling"" reptiles . [ 23 ]  Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs. [ 24 ]  Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including  rauisuchians , also had erect limbs but achieved this by a ""pillar erect"" configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the  upper pelvic bone  was rotated to form an overhanging shelf. [ 24 ]     Natural history     Origins and early evolution       Main article:  Evolution of dinosaurs               Eoraptor , an early dinosaur genus.       For a long time many scientists thought dinosaurs were  polyphyletic  with multiple groups of unrelated ""dinosaurs"" evolving due to similar pressures, [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  but dinosaurs are now known to have formed a single group. [ 28 ] [ 17 ]   Dinosaurs diverged from their  archosaur  ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late  Triassic  period, roughly 20 million years after the  Permian-Triassic extinction event  wiped out an estimated 95% of all  life on Earth . [ 29 ] [ 30 ]   Radiometric dating  of the  rock formation  that contained fossils from the early dinosaur  genus   Eoraptor  establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists believe  Eoraptor  resembles the  common ancestor  of all dinosaurs; [ 31 ]  if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal  predators . [ 32 ]  The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like  ornithodirans  such as  Marasuchus  and  Lagerpeton  in  Argentinian   Middle Triassic  strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.   When dinosaurs appeared, terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of basal archosaurs and  therapsids , such as  aetosaurs ,  cynodonts ,  dicynodonts ,  ornithosuchids ,  rauisuchias , and  rhynchosaurs . Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, in one of two events. First, at about the boundary between the  Carnian  and  Norian   faunal stages  (about 215 million years ago), dicynodonts and a variety of basal  archosauromorphs , including the  prolacertiforms  and rhynchosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the  Triassic-Jurassic extinction event  (about 200 million years ago), that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids,  phytosaurs , and rauisuchians. These losses left behind a land fauna of  crocodylomorphs , dinosaurs,  mammals ,  pterosaurians , and  turtles . [ 17 ]   The first few lines of primitive dinosaurs  diversified  through the  Carnian  and  Norian   stages  of the Triassic, most likely by occupying the niches of groups that became extinct. Traditionally, dinosaurs were thought to have  replaced  the variety of other Triassic land animals by proving superior through a long period of competition. This now appears unlikely, for several reasons. Dinosaurs do not show a pattern of steadily increasing in diversity and numbers, as would be predicted if they were competitively replacing other groups; instead, they were very rare through the Carnian, making up only 1-2% of individuals present in  faunas . In the Norian, however, after the extinction of several other groups, they became significant components of faunas, representing 50-90% of individuals. Also, what had been viewed as a key adaptation of dinosaurs, their erect stance, is now known to have present in several contemporaneous groups that were not as successful (aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, rauisuchians, and some groups of crocodylomorphs). Finally, the Late Triassic itself was a time of great upheaval in life, with shifts in plant life, marine life, and climate. [ 17 ]   Crurotarsans , today represented only by crocodilians but in the Late Triassic also encompassing such now-extinct groups as aetosaurs, phytosaurs, ornithosuchians, and rauisuchians, were actually more diverse in the Late Triassic than dinosaurs, indicating that the survival of dinosaurs had more to do with luck than superiority. [ 33 ]     Low diversification in the Cretaceous   Statistical analyses based on raw data suggest that dinosaurs diversified, i.e. the number of species increased, in the Late  Cretaceous . However in July 2008 Graeme T. Lloyd  et al.  argued that this apparent diversification was an illusion caused by  sampling bias , because Late Cretaceous rocks have been very heavily studied. Instead, they wrote, dinosaurs underwent only two significant diversifications in the Late Cretaceous, the initial  radiations  of the  euhadrosaurs  and  ceratopsians . In the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previous been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites  (fossilized dung) indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Meanwhile  herbivorous  insects and  mammals  diversified rapidly to take advantage of the new type of plant food, while lizards, snakes,  crocodilians  and  birds  also diversified at the same time. Lloyd  et al.  suggest that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Classification       Main article:  Dinosaur classification       Dinosaurs (including birds) are  archosaurs , like modern  crocodilians . Archosaurs'  diapsid  skulls have two holes, called  temporal fenestrae , located where the jaw muscles attach, and an additional  antorbital fenestra  in front of the eyes. Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called  synapsids ; and  turtles , with no temporal fenestra, are  anapsids . Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side.   Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a  superorder  or an unranked  clade . They are divided into two  orders ,  Saurischia  and  Ornithischia , depending upon  pelvic  structure. Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with  birds  than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all  taxa  sharing a more recent common ancestor with  Triceratops  than with Saurischia. Saurischians ('lizard-hipped', from the  Greek   sauros  (  ) meaning 'lizard' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') retained the hip structure of their ancestors, with a  pubis  bone directed  cranially , or forward. [ 22 ]  This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups ( Herrerasaurus , [ 35 ]   therizinosauroids , [ 36 ]   dromaeosaurids , [ 37 ]  and  birds [ 8 ] ). Saurischia includes the  theropods  (bipedal and mostly carnivores, except for birds) and  sauropodomorphs  (long-necked quadrupedal  herbivores ).   By contrast, ornithischians ('bird-hipped', from the  Greek   ornitheios  (  ) meaning 'of a bird' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird's pelvis: the  pubis  bone was oriented  caudally  (rear-pointing). Unlike birds, the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward-pointing process. Ornithischia includes a variety of herbivores. ( NB:  the terms ""lizard hip"" and ""bird-hip"" are misnomers  birds evolved from dinosaurs with ""lizard hips"".)

In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass  Pangaea , there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of  coelophysoid   carnivores  and  prosauropod   herbivores . [ 38 ]   Gymnosperm  plants (particularly  conifers ), a potential food source, radiated in the Late Triassic. Prosauropods did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. [ 39 ]  The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of  ceratosaurians ,  spinosauroids , and  carnosaurians , and herbivores consisting of  stegosaurian  ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the  Morrison Formation  of North America and  Tendaguru Beds  of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized  sinraptorid  theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like  Mamenchisaurus . [ 38 ]   Ankylosaurians  and  ornithopods  were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and  pteridophytes  were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential  cheek -like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. [ 39 ]  Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians . [ 8 ]          An Illustration of 18 species of basal ceratopsia to scale.       By the Early Cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians,  iguanodontians , and  brachiosaurids  through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large  spinosaurid  and  carcharodontosaurid  theropods, and  rebbachisaurid  and  titanosaurian  sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia,  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians  like  dromaeosaurids ,  troodontids , and  oviraptorosaurians  became the common theropods, and  ankylosaurids  and early  ceratopsians  like  Psittacosaurus  became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians,  hypsilophodonts , and iguanodontians. [ 38 ]  The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early Late Cretaceous. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of  flowering plants . At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries, taken to its extreme in  hadrosaurids . [ 39 ]  Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid  Nigersaurus . [ 40 ]   There were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were  tyrannosaurids  and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and  pachycephalosaurians . In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting  Gondwana ,  abelisaurids  were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids,  rhabdodontid  iguanodontians,  nodosaurid  ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent. [ 38 ]  Flowering plants were greatly radiating, [ 39 ]  with the first grasses appearing by the end of the Cretaceous. [ 41 ]  Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia. Theropods were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores, with  therizinosaurians  and  ornithomimosaurians  becoming common. [ 39 ]   The  CretaceousTertiary extinction event , which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the birds. Some other  diapsid  groups, such as crocodylians,  lizards ,  snakes ,  sphenodontians , and  choristoderans , also survived the event. [ 42 ]     Paleobiology   Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil records, including  fossilized   bones ,  feces ,  trackways ,  gastroliths ,  feathers , impressions of skin,  internal organs  and  soft tissues . [ 43 ] [ 44 ]  Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including  physics  (especially  biomechanics ),  chemistry ,  biology , and the  earth sciences  (of which  paleontology  is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.     Size       Main article:  Dinosaur size              Scale diagram comparing the largest known dinosaurs in four  suborders  and a human.       While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the  sauropods  were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an  order of magnitude  more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric  mammals  such as the  Indricotherium  and the Columbian  mammoth  were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach or surpass them in size  most notably the  blue whale , which reaches up to 173,000 kilograms (381,000 lb) and over 30 meters (100 ft) in length. [ 45 ]  There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but it may be that the most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in  rock formations  interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments. [ 46 ]   Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. [ 31 ]  Theropod dinosaurs, when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on  order of magnitude , most often fall into the 100 to 1,000 kilogram (220 to 2,200 lb) category, whereas  recent  predatory  carnivorans  peak in the 10 to 100 kilogram (22 to 220 lb) category. [ 47 ]  The  mode  of dinosaur body masses is between one and ten metric tonnes. [ 48 ]  This contrasts sharply with the size of  Cenozoic  mammals, estimated by the  National Museum of Natural History  as about 2 to 5 kilograms (5 to 10 lb). [ 49 ]     Largest and smallest   Only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the  largest and smallest dinosaurs .          Comparative size of  Brachiosaurus .       The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is  Brachiosaurus brancai  (also known as  Giraffatitan ). Its remains were discovered in  Tanzania  between 190712. Bones from multiple similarly-sized individuals were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the  Humboldt Museum  of  Berlin ; [ 50 ]  this mount is 12 meters (39 ft) tall and 22.5 meters (74 ft) long, and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between 30,000 and 60,000 kilograms (70,000 and 130,000 lb). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 m (89 ft) long  Diplodocus , which was discovered in  Wyoming  in the  United States  and displayed in  Pittsburgh's   Carnegie Natural History Museum  in 1907.          Comparative size of  Eoraptor .       There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils. Most of the largest  herbivorous  specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive  Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed 80,000 to 100,000 kilograms (90 to 110 short tons); some of the longest, the 33.5 meters (110 ft) long  Diplodocus hallorum [ 46 ]  (formerly  Seismosaurus ) and the 33 meters (110 ft) long  Supersaurus ; [ 51 ]  and the tallest, the 18 meters (59 ft)  Sauroposeidon , which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The longest of them all may have been  Amphicoelias fragillimus , known only from a now lost partial vertebral  neural arch  described in 1878. Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone, the animal may have been 58 meters (190 ft) long and weighed over 120,000 kilograms (260,000 lb), [ 46 ]  heavier than all known dinosaurs except possibly the poorly known  Bruhathkayosaurus , which could have weighed 175,000 to 220,000 kilograms (400,000 to 500,000 lb). The largest known  carnivorous  dinosaur was  Spinosaurus , reaching a length of 16 to 18 meters (50 to 60 ft), and weighing in at 8,150 kilograms (18,000 lb). [ 52 ]  Other large meat-eaters included  Giganotosaurus ,  Mapusaurus ,  Tyrannosaurus rex  and  Carcharodontosaurus .   Not including modern birds, the smallest dinosaurs known were about the size of a  pigeon . [ 53 ]  The theropods  Anchiornis  and  Epidexipteryx  both had a total skeletal length of under 35 centimeters (1.1 ft). [ 54 ] [ 53 ]   Anchiornis  is currently the smallest dinosaur described from an adult specimen, with an estimated weight of 110 grams. [ 54 ]  The smallest herbivorous dinosaurs included  Microceratus  and  Wannanosaurus , at about 60 cm long (2 ft) each. [ 55 ] [ 56 ]     Behavior          A nesting ground of  Maiasaura  was discovered in 1978.       Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their  habitat ,  computer simulations  of their  biomechanics , and comparisons with modern animals in similar  ecological niches . As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.   The first potential evidence of  herding  behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31  Iguanodon  dinosaurs which were then thought to have perished together in  Bernissart ,  Belgium , after they fell into a deep, flooded  sinkhole  and drowned. [ 57 ]  Other mass death sites have been subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that  duck-bills  (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the  American Bison  or the African  Springbok . Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in  Oxfordshire , England, [ 58 ]  although there is not evidence for specific herd structures. [ 59 ]  Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for  migratory  purposes, or to provide protection for their young. There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in  Inner Mongolia  that has yielded the remains of over twenty  Sinornithomimus , from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud. [ 60 ]  The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as  pack hunters  working together to bring down large prey. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  However, this lifestyle is uncommon among the modern relatives of dinosaurs ( crocodiles  and other reptiles, and  birds  -  Harris's Hawk  is a well-documented exception), and the  taphonomic  evidence suggesting pack hunting in such theropods as  Deinonychus  and  Allosaurus  can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern  diapsid  predators. [ 63 ]          Fossilized egg of the  oviraptorid   Citipati ,  American Museum of Natural History .       Jack Horner's  1978 discovery of a  Maiasaura  (""good mother dinosaur"")  nesting  ground in  Montana  demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the  ornithopods . [ 64 ]  There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like  Patagonian   titanosaurian  sauropods (1997 discovery), also nested in large groups. [ 65 ]  The  Mongolian   oviraptorid   Citipati  was discovered in a  chicken -like  brooding  position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the  eggs  warm. [ 66 ]  Parental care is also implied by other finds. For example, the fossilized remains of a grouping of  Psittacosaurus  has been found, consisting of one adult and 34 juveniles; in this case, the large number of juveniles may be due to communal nesting. [ 67 ]  Additionally, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the  prosauropod   Massospondylus ) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur. [ 68 ]  Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the  Isle of Skye  in northwestern  Scotland . [ 69 ]  Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.          Artist's rendering of two  Centrosaurus , herbivorous  ceratopsid  dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous fauna of North America.       The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the  marginocephalians ,  theropods  and  lambeosaurines , may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and  territorialism . Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations. [ 70 ]  The nature of dinosaur  communication  also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent studies suggest that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as  resonance chambers  used for a wide range of  vocalizations . [ 71 ] [ 72 ]   From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the  Gobi Desert  in 1971. It included a  Velociraptor  attacking a  Protoceratops , [ 73 ]  providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. [ 74 ]  Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially-healed tail of an  Edmontosaurus , a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. [ 74 ]   Cannibalism  amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod  Majungasaurus . [ 75 ]   Based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as  Oryctodromeus , some herbivorous species seem to have led a partially  fossorial  (burrowing) lifestyle, [ 76 ]  and some bird-like species may have been  arboreal  (tree-climbing), most notably primitive  dromaeosaurids  such as  Microraptor [ 77 ]  and the enigmatic  scansoriopterygids . [ 78 ]  However, most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of  biomechanics , in particular, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, [ 79 ]  whether  diplodocids  could create  sonic booms  via  whip -like tail snapping, [ 80 ]  and whether sauropods could float. [ 81 ]     Physiology       Main article:  Physiology of dinosaurs               Tyrannosaurus rex  skull and upper vertebral column, Palais de la Dcouverte, Paris.       A vigorous debate on the subject of temperature regulation in dinosaurs has been ongoing since the 1960s. Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur  endotherm  has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation.   After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were  ectothermic  creatures: ""terrible  lizards "" as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness implied that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, comparable to modern reptiles, which need external sources of heat in order to regulate their body temperature. Dinosaur ectothermy remained a prevalent view until  Robert T. ""Bob"" Bakker , an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968.   Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (perhaps aided by the animals' bulk). Evidence of  endotherm  in dinosaurs includes the discovery of  polar dinosaurs in Australia  and  Antarctica  (where they would have experienced a cold, dark six-month winter), the discovery of dinosaurs whose feathers may have provided regulatory insulation, and analysis of blood-vessel structures that are typical of endotherms within dinosaur bone. Skeletal structures suggest that theropods and other dinosaurs had active lifestyles better suited to an endothermic cardiovascular system, while sauropods exhibit fewer endothermic characteristics. It is certainly possible that some dinosaurs were endothermic while others were not. Scientific debate over the specifics continues. [ 82 ]           Eubrontes , a dinosaur footprint in the Lower  Jurassic  Moenave Formation at the St. George Dinosaur Discovery Site at Johnson Farm, southwestern Utah.       Complicating the debate is the fact that warm-bloodedness can emerge based on more than one mechanism. Most discussions of dinosaur endothermy tend to compare them to average birds or mammals, which expend energy to elevate body temperature above that of the environment. Small birds and mammals also possess  insulation , such as  fat ,  fur , or  feathers , which slows down heat loss. However, large mammals, such as elephants, face a different problem because of their relatively small ratio of surface area to volume ( Haldane's  principle). This ratio compares the volume of an animal with the area of its skin: as an animal gets bigger, its surface area increases more slowly than its volume. At a certain point, the amount of heat radiated away through the skin drops below the amount of heat produced inside the body, forcing animals to use additional methods to avoid overheating. In the case of elephants, they have little hair as adults, and have large ears which increase their surface area, and have behavioral adaptations as well (such as using the trunk to spray water on themselves and mud wallowing). These behaviors increase cooling through evaporation.   Large dinosaurs would presumably have had to deal with similar issues; their body size suggest they lost heat relatively slowly to the surrounding air, and so could have been what are called  inertial homeotherms , animals that are warmer than their environments through sheer size rather than through special adaptations like those of birds or mammals. However, so far this theory fails to account for the numerous dog- and goat-sized dinosaur species, or the young of larger species.   Modern  computerized tomography  (CT) scans of a  dinosaur 's chest cavity (conducted in 2000) found the apparent remnants of a four-chambered heart, much like those found in today's mammals and birds. [ 83 ]  The idea is controversial within the scientific community, coming under fire for bad anatomical science [ 84 ]  or simply wishful thinking. [ 85 ]  The question of how this find reflects on metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy may be moot, though, regardless of the object's identity: both modern  crocodilians  and  birds , the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well. [ 86 ]     Soft tissue and DNA           Scipionyx samniticus  fossil showing tissue impressions, at the  Museo Civico di Storia Naturale , in Milan, Italy.       One of the best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in  Petraroia ,  Italy . The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young  coelurosaur ,  Scipionyx  samniticus . The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur. [ 43 ]   In the March 2005 issue of  Science , the paleontologist  Mary Higby Schweitzer  and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old  Tyrannosaurus rex  leg  bone  from the  Hell Creek Formation  in  Montana . After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team. [ 44 ]   When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as  blood vessels , bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear; study and interpretation of the material is ongoing. [ 44 ]   Newer research, published in PloS One (30 July 2008), has challenged the claims that the material found is the soft tissue of  Tyrannosaurus . Thomas Kaye of the  University of Washington  and his co-authors contend that what was really inside the tyrannosaur bone was slimy  biofilm  created by bacteria that coated the voids once occupied by blood vessels and cells. [ 87 ]  The researchers found that what previously had been identified as remnants of blood cells, because of the presence of iron, were actually  framboids , microscopic mineral spheres bearing iron. They found similar spheres in a variety of other fossils from various periods, including an  ammonite . In the ammonite they found the spheres in a place where the iron they contain could not have had any relationship to the presence of blood. [ 88 ]   The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions, but upon further inspection and  peer review , neither of these reports could be confirmed. [ 89 ]  However, a functional visual  peptide  of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds. [ 90 ]  In addition, several  proteins  have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils, [ 91 ]  including hemoglobin. [ 92 ]   Even if dinosaur DNA could be reconstructed, it would be exceedingly difficult to clone and ""grow"" dinosaurs using current technology since no closely related species exist to provide  zygotes  or a suitable environment for  embryonic development .     Feathers and the origin of birds       Main article:  Origin of birds       The possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by  Thomas Henry Huxley . [ 93 ]  After the work of  Gerhard Heilmann  in the early 20th century, the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of generalized  thecodont  ancestors, with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of  clavicles  in dinosaurs. [ 94 ]  However, as later discoveries showed, clavicles (or a single fused  wishbone , which derived from separate clavicles) were not actually absent; [ 8 ]  they had been found as early as 1924 in  Oviraptor , but misidentified as an  interclavicle . [ 95 ]  In the 1970s,  John Ostrom  revived the dinosaur-bird theory, [ 96 ]  which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis, [ 97 ]  and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds. [ 18 ]  Of particular note has been the fossils of the  Yixian Formation , where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found, often with feathers of some type. [ 8 ]  Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives. [ 98 ]  They are most closely allied with  maniraptoran  coelurosaurs. [ 8 ]  A minority of scientists, most notably  Alan Feduccia  and  Larry Martin , have proposed other evolutionary paths, including revised versions of Heilmann's basal archosaur proposal, [ 99 ]  or that maniraptoran theropods are the ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs, only  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ]     Feathers       Main article:  Feathered dinosaurs              The famous Berlin Specimen of  Archaeopteryx lithographica .       Archaeopteryx , the first good example of a ""feathered dinosaur"", was discovered in 1861. The initial specimen was found in the  Solnhofen limestone  in southern Germany, which is a  lagersttte , a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils.  Archaeopteryx  is a  transitional fossil , with features clearly intermediate between those of modern reptiles and birds. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal  The Origin of Species , its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of  evolutionary biology  and  creationism . This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for  Compsognathus . [ 101 ]   Since the 1990s, a number of additional  feathered dinosaurs  have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the  lagersttte  of the Yixian Formation,  Liaoning , northeastern  China , which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found only in a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be due to the fact that delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by  fossilization  and thus are absent from the fossil record. To this point, protofeathers (thin, filament-like structures) are known from dinosaurs at the base of Coelurosauria, such as  compsognathids  like  Sinosauropteryx  and  tyrannosauroids  ( Dilong ), [ 102 ]  but barbed feathers are only known among the coelurosaur subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. [ 8 ] [ 103 ]  The description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that protofeathers are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' integument, [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with barbed feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ] [ 105 ]  However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the question of the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been raised. [ 107 ]     Skeleton   Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the  missing link  between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for  paleontologists . Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck,  pubis ,  wrist  (semi-lunate  carpal ), arm and  pectoral girdle , furcula (wishbone), and  breast bone . Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through  cladistic analysis  strengthens the case for the link.     Soft anatomy   Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation which was led by  Patrick O'Connor  of  Ohio University . The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their  skeletons , as is the case in birds. ""What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds"", O'Connor said. [ 108 ]  In a paper published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE (September 29, 2008), scientists described  Aerosteon riocoloradensis , the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like breathing system.  CT-scanning  revealed the evidence of air sacs within the body cavity of the  Aerosteon  skeleton. [ 109 ] [ 110 ]   Another piece of evidence that birds and dinosaurs are closely related is the use of  gizzard  stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with  fossils , gizzard stones are called  gastroliths . [ 111 ]     Reproductive biology   A discovery of features in a  Tyrannosaurus rex   skeleton  recently provided more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs between the hard outer bone and the  marrow . This  medullary  bone, which is rich in  calcium , is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally-derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the  Tyrannosaurus rex  specimen's hind limb suggested that  T. rex  used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female. [ 112 ]  Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod  Allosaurus  and ornithopod  Tenontosaurus . Because the line of dinosaurs that includes  Allosaurus  and  Tyrannosaurus  diverged from the line that led to  Tenontosaurus  very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue. Medullary bone has been found in specimens of sub-adult size, which suggests that dinosaurs reached sexual maturity rather quickly for such large animals. [ 113 ]     Behavioral evidence   A recently discovered  troodont  fossil demonstrates that some dinosaurs slept like certain modern birds, with their heads tucked under their arms. [ 114 ]  This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds.     Extinction       Main articles:  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  and  KT boundary       Non-avian dinosaurs suddenly became  extinct  approximately 65 million years ago. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including  ammonites  ( nautilus -like  mollusks ),  mosasaurs , plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, herbivorous  turtles  and  crocodiles , most birds, and many groups of mammals. [ 16 ]  This  mass extinction  is known as the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event . The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the general consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.   At the peak of the Mesozoic, there were no  polar ice caps , and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250 meters (300 to 800 ft) higher than they are today. The planet's temperature was also much more uniform, with only 25  C  (45  F ) separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator. On average, atmospheric temperatures were also much warmer; the poles, for example, were 50 C (90 F) warmer than today. [ 115 ] [ 116 ]   The atmosphere's composition during the Mesozoic was vastly different as well. Carbon dioxide levels were up to 12 times higher than today's levels, and oxygen formed 32 to 35% of the atmosphere, as compared to 21% today. However, by the late Cretaceous, the environment was changing dramatically. Volcanic activity was decreasing, which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably. Some scientists hypothesize that climate change, combined with lower oxygen levels, might have led directly to the demise of many species. If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds, it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency, given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies. [ 16 ]     Impact event       Main article:  Chicxulub crater              The  Chicxulub Crater  at the tip of the  Yucatn Peninsula ; the impactor that formed this crater may have caused the dinosaur extinction.       The asteroid collision theory, which was brought to wide attention in 1980 by  Walter Alvarez  and colleagues, links the  extinction event  at the end of the Cretaceous period to a  bolide  impact approximately 65.5 million years ago. Alvarez  et al.  proposed that a sudden increase in  iridium  levels, recorded around the world in the period's rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. [ 117 ]  The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a 5 to 15 kilometer (3 to 9 mi) wide  bolide  hit in the vicinity of the  Yucatn Peninsula , creating the 170 kilometers (110 mi) wide  Chicxulub Crater  and triggering the  mass extinction . [ 118 ]  Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the  impact event . Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave.   Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun).   In September 2007, U.S. researchers led by  William Bottke  of the  Southwest Research Institute  in  Boulder, Colorado , and  Czech  scientists used  computer  simulations to identify the probable source of the Chicxulub impact. They calculated a 90% probability that a giant asteroid named  Baptistina , approximately 160 kilometers (100 mi) in diameter, orbiting in the asteroid belt which lies between  Mars  and  Jupiter , was struck by a smaller unnamed asteroid about 55 kilometers (35 mi) in diameter about 160 million years ago. The impact shattered Baptistina, creating a cluster which still exists today as the  Baptistina family . Calculations indicate that some of the fragments were sent hurtling into earth-crossing orbits, one of which was the 10 kilometers (6 mi) wide  meteorite  which struck  Mexico 's  Yucatan   peninsula  65 million years ago, creating the  Chicxulub crater  (175 kilometers (110 mi)). [ 119 ]   While similar to Alvarez's impact theory (which involved a single asteroid or comet), this theory proposes that ""passages of the  solar companion star Nemesis  through the  Oort comet cloud  would trigger comet showers."" [ 120 ]  One or more of these objects then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time, causing the worldwide extinction. As with the impact of a single asteroid, the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures, followed by a protracted cool period. [ 120 ]     Deccan Traps       Main article:  Deccan Traps       Before 2000, arguments that the  Deccan Traps   flood basalts  caused the  extinction  were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 mya and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two-thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in 1 million years about 65.5 mya, so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly a period of thousands of years, but still a longer period than what would be expected from a single impact event. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulphuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reducing photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the  greenhouse effect  when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere. [ 122 ]  Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of  volcanic gasses  during the formation of the  Deccan traps  ""contributed to an apparently massive  global warming . Some data point to an average rise in temperature of 8 C (14 F) in the last half million years before the  impact [at Chicxulub] ."" [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction,  Luis Alvarez  (who died in 1988) replied that  paleontologists  were being misled by  sparse data . While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in  sea level  and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions. [ 123 ]     Failure to adapt to changing conditions   Lloyd  et al.  (2008) noted that, in the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previously been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites   fossilized dung  indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Statistical analysis by Lloyd  et al.  concluded that, contrary to earlier studies, dinosaurs did not diversify very much in the Late Cretaceous. Lloyd  et al.  suggested that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Possible Paleocene survivors   Nonavian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the  K-T boundary . In 2002, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single  hadrosaur  leg bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico and described it as evidence of  Paleocene dinosaurs . The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early  Paleocene  epoch approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that  stratum  by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era. [ 124 ]  Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the  Hell Creek Formation  up to 1.3 meters (51 in) above (40,000 years later than) the K-T boundary. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China. [ 125 ]  Many scientists, however, dismiss the ""Paleocene dinosaurs"" as re-worked, i.e. washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments, [ 126 ] [ 127 ]  or find that, if correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction. [ 126 ]     History of discovery   Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese, whose modern word for dinosaur is  konglong  (, or ""terrible dragon""), considered them to be  dragon   bones  and documented them as such. For example,  Hua Yang Guo Zhi , a book written by Zhang Qu during the  Western Jin Dynasty , reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in  Sichuan  Province. [ 128 ]  Villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized ""dragon bones"" for use in traditional medicines, a practice that continues today. [ 129 ]  In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of  giants  and other creatures killed by the  Great Flood .   Scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in  England . Part of a bone, now known to have been the  femur  of a  Megalosaurus , [ 130 ]  was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near  Chipping Norton ,  Oxfordshire , England in 1676. The fragment was sent to  Robert Plot , Professor of Chemistry at the  University of Oxford  and first curator of the  Ashmolean Museum , who published a description in his  Natural History of Oxfordshire  in 1677. He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the  femur  of a large animal, but recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species. He therefore concluded it to be the thigh bone of a giant human similar to those mentioned in the  Bible . In 1699,  Edward Lhuyd , a friend of  Sir Isaac Newton , was responsible for the first published scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a  sauropod   tooth , "" Rutellum implicatum "" [ 131 ] [ 132 ] , that had been found in Caswell, near Whitney, Oxfordshire. [ 133 ]           William Buckland .       Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev  William Buckland , a professor of  geology  at  Oxford University , collected more fossilized bones of  Megalosaurus  and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a  scientific journal . [ 134 ] [ 130 ]  The second dinosaur genus to be identified,  Iguanodon , was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell - the wife of English geologist  Gideon Mantell . Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between  his fossils  and the bones of modern  iguanas . He published his findings in 1825. [ 135 ] [ 136 ]   The study of these ""great fossil lizards"" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist  Richard Owen  coined the term ""dinosaur"". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far,  Iguanodon ,  Megalosaurus  and  Hylaeosaurus , shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of  Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha , the husband of  Queen Victoria , Owen established the  Natural History Museum  in  South Kensington ,  London , to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.   In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in  marl  pits in the small town of  Haddonfield, New Jersey  (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named  Hadrosaurus  foulkii . It was an extremely important find;  Hadrosaurus  was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found and it was clearly a  bipedal  creature. ( The first  was in 1834, in Maidstone, Kent, England) This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the  United States .           Othniel Charles Marsh , 19th century photograph.               Edward Drinker Cope , 19th century photograph.       Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Othniel Charles Marsh , both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the  Bone Wars . The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an  Elasmosaurus  skeleton was flawed; Cope had inadvertently placed the  plesiosaur 's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the  US Geological Survey . Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods; for example, their diggers often used  dynamite  to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast; Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, for a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the  American Museum of Natural History  in  New York , while Marsh's is on display at the  Peabody Museum of Natural History  at  Yale University . [ 137 ]   Since 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils has extended to every continent, including  Antarctica . The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the  ankylosaurid   Antarctopelta oliveroi , was found on  Ross Island  in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod  Cryolophosaurus ellioti , was formally named and described in a scientific journal.   Current dinosaur ""hot spots"" include southern South America (especially  Argentina ) and  China . China in particular has produced many exceptional  feathered dinosaur  specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to  fossilization .     The ""dinosaur renaissance""       Main article:  Dinosaur renaissance       The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by  John Ostrom 's discovery of  Deinonychus , an active predator that may have been  warm-blooded , in marked contrast to the then-prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and  cold-blooded .  Vertebrate paleontology  has become a global  science . Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including  India , South America,  Madagascar ,  Antarctica , and most significantly in  China  (the amazingly well-preserved  feathered dinosaurs  in  China  have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of  cladistics , which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in  classifying  dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary  fossil record .     Cultural depictions       Main article:  Cultural depictions of dinosaurs              A  Megalosaurus  stalks  Crystal Palace Park  in  London .       By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word ""dinosaur"" into the common  vernacular  reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, ""dinosaur"" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, slow-moving, obsolete, or bound for extinction. [ 138 ]   Public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in  Victorian  England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, the famous  dinosaur sculptures  were unveiled in  London 's  Crystal Palace Park . The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and  museums  around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way. [ 139 ]  Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the  Bone Wars  of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions. [ 140 ]   The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in  literature ,  film  and other  media . Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in  Charles Dickens'   Bleak House , [ 141 ]  dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of  fictional  works.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's 1912 book  The Lost World , the iconic 1933  film   King Kong , 1954's  Godzilla  and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel  Jurassic Park  by  Michael Crichton  and its 1993  film adaptation  are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest  non-fictional  works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in  advertising ; numerous  companies  have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted or obsolete. [ 142 ]     Religious views       Main article:  Young Earth Creationism#Palaeontology and dinosaurs       Various religious groups have views about dinosaurs that differ from those held by the vast majority of scientists, usually due to conflicts with  creation stories  in their scriptures. However, most of the  scientific  community rejects these religiously-inspired interpretations of dinosaurs.

My answers apply mainly to the two kinds of penguins I know best, the Adelie penguins and the Emperor penguins. Just remember that although I've lived with penguins for more than a year, I'm no substitute for a real ornithologist... IANAO, I just impersonate one on the Internet ! Before you read the FAQ, have you read the  FACTS about Antarctic penguins  ?                 What ?     Right : A racing penguin... No, seriously, it's an adelie penguin which has been tagged by biologists so they can recognize him.      What's a penguin ?   A short-legged flightless bird of cold southern regions (Antarctica and sub-antarctic islands) having webbed feet and wings evolved as flippers.    Who discovered the Adelie or Emperor penguins ?   Nobody knows. The first discoverers of Antarctica saw many on the shores, but it's also possible to see them farther north, resting on floating pieces of ice, so even explorers of southern seas who didn't reach Antarctica saw many in the 18th century. And sometimes penguins get lost and end up in the wrong places. There was an Emperor penguin spending the winter in  Tasmania , alone, a few years ago. Antarctica itself was thus discovered much later than the penguins that live on it.   Adelie penguins are named after Adelie Land which was named by French discoverer Dumont d'Urville after his wife, Ade, in 1840. So even if people had seen Adelie penguins before him, they did not give them a specific name.   Captain Cook saw many  King  Penguins during his 1775 trip. The biologist of the expedition, Forster, made many drawings. 69 years later, Gray studied those drawings and noticed one that was different: it was the first  Emperor  penguin, thus the latin name  Aptenodytes Forsteri .     Where does the word ' penguin ' come from ?   The first animal called penguin was a flightless bird of the Arctic sea, also known as the  Great Auk , which was very similar to a penguin in anatomy, although from a different order of birds. It was hunted to extinction in the 1600s. Then when later explorers discovered similar animals in the southern seas, they named them the same way. The word itself has muddy origin; it originally seemed to mean ' fat one ' in spanish/portuguese, and may come from either the Welsh 'pen gwyn' (white head), from the Latin 'pinguis' (fat) or from a corruption of 'pin-wing' (pinioned wings).    Where do penguins come from ?   The earliest known fossils of penguins were found in Peru. The 80cm tall  Perudyptes devriesi  living 42 million years ago and the more impressive but more recent  Icadyptes salasi , 150cm 36 million years ago.           Right : Emperor penguins on the edge of the ice shelf, ready for departure in spring. This image is actually used in Al Gore's presentation  An Inconvenient Truth      How many species of penguins are there ?   There are currently 17 species of Penguins (some scientists divide them in 18 or even 19 species). Fossil records indicate that there used to be more in the past. The current ones, all living in the southern hemisphere, are: Adelie, African, Chinstrap, Emperor, Erect Crested, Fairy, Fjordland, Galapagos, Gentoo, Humboldt, King, Macaroni, Magellanic, Rockhopper, Royal, Snares Island and Yellow Eyed. Some have multiple names (royal=king, little blue=fairy...). The current species are divided into 6 genus: Aptenodytes, Eudyptes, Eudyptula, Megadyptes, Pygoscelis and Spheniscus. I know well only the Adelie and Emperor which lived in the vicinity of  Dumont d'Urville , but I have a few pictures of the Fairy (aka Little Blue) and Yellow Eyed penguins on my  Tasmanian  and  New Zealand  pages.   Many more species of fossile penguins are known.    Are new species of penguins still being discovered ?   Amazingly the answer is yes... but not living species. In 2008  New-Zealand  researchers announced the discovery of bones belonging to a previously unknown specie, the Waitaha penguin, which went extinct about 500 years ago, soon after the human settlement of the islands.    How many penguins are there, total ?   Many parts of Antarctica, including some of the shores, have never been explored, so the precise number of penguins is unknown. Evaluations have been done by counting manually the penguin population in some areas and extrapolating to the entire continent. The numbers of 2 300 000 pairs of Adelie Penguin and 220 000 pairs of Emperor Penguin have been proposed by some researchers. But keep in mind that those are highly inaccurate statistics, most colonies not having been visited in decades, and many more having never received a visit. Also some estimates have been performed at the wrong time of year or not from manual counts (based on aerial photographs for instance).                 Why aren't there penguins in the Arctic ?   Well, as you just read above, there used to be one flightless bird called penguin, also known as the  Great Auk , but it was hunted to extinction four centuries ago. The reason that there aren't any is probably because of predators: penguins need to go on land to nest and are quite defenseless with their feet on the ground. Antarctica and other southern island are devoid or have few land  predators . The Arctic has bears, wolves, foxes, rats and more...           Right : An adelie penguin moulting in autumn.     Are penguins mammals/birds/fish/...?   Here are a few clues: they lay eggs, they have feathers, they breathe air, they have clawed feet, they have a beak... Can you put the clues together ?   I had a good laugh recently when talking with two  veterinary  students. One was  certain  that penguins are mammals (like seals), the other was  certain  that penguins are fish. I hope my pets don't ever get sick !     Do penguins have feathers ?   Yes they do, like all birds. Their feathers are very compact and hard. When they are hot they ruffle them. And we could often see them plucking out old feathers or scratching (they have parasites like fleas and mites). On the  picture on the right  you can see an Adelie penguin loosing its old feathers before returning to sea, a process called moulting (also spelled 'molting' and also called feathering or shedding) that happens in november-december for Emperors and march-april for Adelie penguins.    Can you send me some penguin feathers ?   Unfortunately I never brought back any, so don't ask...    Do penguins have ears ?   They do not have external visible ears. But they do have an ear canal (there's probably a more scientific term for it) under their feathers that allows them to hear sounds both in the air and underwater. Hearing is an important sense for them as they recognize each other by their voice.        Not cold ?                 Right : An Emperor penguin chick overheating on a hot spring day.     Why don't penguins get cold ?   Mainly because they are fat ! Fat has two main purposes in the body: it is a good insulator against cold and also it is a reserve of energy. When the emperor penguins arrive in autumn to stay the winter in Antarctica without eating, about half of their bodyweight is made of a 4cm thick layer of fat which they will use to withstand the long cold nights.   But most of the thermal  "

The number of penguin species is   debated. Depending on which authority is followed, penguin biodiversity varies between 17 and 20 living   species, all in the subfamily  Spheniscinae . Some sources consider the  White-flippered Penguin  a separate  Eudyptula  species, while   others treat it as a subspecies of the  Little Penguin  (e.g. Williams, 1995; Davis &   Renner, 2003); the actual situation seems to be more complicated (Banks  et   al.  2002). Similarly, it is still unclear whether the  Royal Penguin  is merely a   color morph of the  Macaroni penguin . Also eligible to be a   separate species is the Northern population of  Rockhopper penguins  (Davis & Renner,   2003). Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they   are not, contrary to popular belief, found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few   species of penguin actually live so far south. At least ten  species live in the temperate zone; one lives as far north as the Galápagos Islands: the  Galápagos   Penguin .    The largest living species is the  Emperor Penguin  ( Aptenodytes forsteri ):   adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species   is the  Little Blue   Penguin  (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall   (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit   colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even   tropical climates ( see also  Bergmann's Rule). Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes,   becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were   not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and   at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2000 km south of the Equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedy warmer than   today.         Index of Penguin Species        Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid, and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend   half of their life on land and half in the oceans.    Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of   explorers without hesitation. This is probably on account of there being no land   predators in Antarctica or the   nearby offshore islands that prey on or   attack penguins. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the leopard seal. Typically,   penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (9 feet); they become   nervous at about that distance. This is also the distance that Antarctic   tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach   closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come   closer).        Penguin biology     Penguins are superbly adapted to an aquatic life. Their wings have become flippers, useless for flight in the air.   In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved,   ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters.   On land, penguins use their tails and wings   to maintain balance for their upright stance.     All penguins are countershaded - that is, they have a white   underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. This is for camouflage. A predator looking up from below (such   as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing   between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage   on their backs camouflages them from above.     Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports   of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of   startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their   prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes.   Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large  Emperor Penguin  have   been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1870 ft) and last up to 22   minutes.     Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the   snow, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving   quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more   quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.     Penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds (Wever  et al  1969); this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded colonies (Jouventin  et   al  1999). Their eyes are adapted for   underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding   predators; in air it has been suggested that they are nearsighted, although research has not supported   this hypothesis (Sivak  et al  1987).     Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers which are designed to keep   them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The Emperor   penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which   further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to   control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood which gets   cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of   the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males   to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and   rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the   heat pack.     They can drink salt water because their supraorbital gland filters excess salt from   the bloodstream. The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from   the nasal passages.         Breeding     Some penguins mate for life, others for just one season. They generally raise   a small brood, and the parents cooperate in caring for the clutch and the young.   During the cold season on the other hand the mates separate for several months   to protect the egg. Usually, the male stays with the egg and keeps it warm while   the female goes to sea to find food for the baby. When the female comes back,   they switch roles.     When mothers lose a chick, they   sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as   other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick.   In some species, such as  Emperor Penguins , young penguins assemble in   large groups called crèches.         Isabelline Penguins     Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather   than black plumage. These are called Isabelline penguins, possibly in reference   to the legend that the archduchess Isabella of Austria vowed not to change her   undergarments until her husband united the northern and southern Low Countries   by taking the city of Ostend--which took three years to accomplish.  Isabellinism is different from albinism, though the faded   color of the plumage calls albinism to mind. Isabelline penguins tend to live   shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well camouflaged against the   deep, and are often passed over as mates.

ORDER SPHENISCIFORMES           Basal and unresolved taxa  (all fossil)                    Waimanu  - basal   (Middle-Late Paleocene): Waimanu was a genus of early penguin which lived soon after the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event, lending support to the theory that the radiation of modern birds took place before the extinction of the dinosaurs, not after as others had proposed. While it was a very early member of the sphenisciformes, Waimanu was flightless (like all modern members of its order). Though its wing bones do not show the extreme specializations modern penguins have for an aquatic lifestyle, it does seem adapted for wing-propelled diving, and may have resembled a flightless loon. Discovered in Canterbury,  New Zealand  riverbed sediments (near the Waipara River) of the Waipara Greensand Formation in 1980, the name Waimanu comes from Māori for ""waterbird"". Two species are known, W. manneringi from the Early Paleocene and W. tuatahi from the Late Paleocene.            Perudyptes  (Middle   Eocene of Atacama Desert, Peru) - basal?            Sphenisciformes gen. et sp. indet. CADIC P 21 (Leticia Middle Eocene of   Punta Torcida, Argentina: Clarke  et al.  2003)            Delphinornis  (Middle/Late Eocene ?- Early Oligocene of Seymour Island, Antarctica) -   Palaeeudyptinae, basal, new subfamily 1?            Archaeospheniscus  (Middle/Late Eocene -   Late Oligocene) - Palaeeudyptinae? New subfamily 2? : Archaeospheniscus is an extinct genus of large penguins. It currently contains three species, known from somewhat fragmentary remains. A. wimani, the smallest species (about the size of a  Gentoo Penguin ), was found in Middle or Late Eocene strata (34-50 MYA) of the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island, Antarctica, whereas the other two, about the size of a modern  Emperor Penguin , are known from bones recovered from the Late Oligocene Kokoamu Greensand Formation (27-28 MYA) at Duntroon,  New Zealand . The genus is one of the earliest known primitive penguins. Its humerus is still very slender, between the form seen in ordinary bird wings and the thickened condition found in modern penguins. On the other hand, the tarsometatarsus shows a peculiar mix of characters found in modern and primitive forms. Whether this signifies that the genus is an ancestor of modern taxa or represents a case of parallel evolution is unknown.                           Species                                    Lowe's Penguin  ( Archaeospheniscus   lowei ) : Lowe's Penguin (Archaeospheniscus lowei) is the type species of the extinct penguin genus Archaeospheniscus. It stood approximately 85-115 cm high, between a modern  King Penguin  and an  Emperor Penguin  in size. It is known from bones of a single individual (Otago Museum C.47.20) and possibly some additional material such as the OM C.47.27 femur, all recovered from the Late Oligocene Kokoamu Greensand Formation (27-28 MYA) at Duntroon,  New Zealand . The species' binomen was given in honor of Percy Lowe, who researched prehistoric penguins and proposed a theory (now considered erroneous) that these birds were derived from reptiles independently of the other modern birds.                    Lopdell's Penguin  ( Archaeospheniscus lopdelli ) : Lopdell's Penguin (Archaeospheniscus lopdelli) was the largest species of the extinct penguin genus Archaeospheniscus, standing about 90-120 cm high, or somewhat less than the extant  Emperor Penguin . It is only known from bones of a single individual (Otago Museum C.47.21) which was found in the Late Oligocene Kokoamu Greensand Formation (27-28 MYA) at Duntroon,  New Zealand . Bones apparently belonging to this species are now also known from the Late Eocene La Meseta Formation (34-37 MYA) on Seymour Island, Antarctica (Tambussi et al., 2006). As the bird is not very well distinguished except in size from its contemporary congener Archaeospheniscus lowei and the size range, an estimated 85-120 cm, is in the upper range of the variation found in modern penguins, it is probable that A. lopdelli is a synonym of A. lowelli. As the recent finds in Antarctica suggest, this is far from certain, however, and there remains much to be learned about the systematics and biogeography of the two larger Archaeospheniscus species. The species' binomen honors J. C. Lopdell, who assisted Marples in recovering the fossils of this bird and others found in the Duntroon excavations.                    Archaeospheniscus wimani  : Archaeospheniscus wimani is an extinct species of penguin. It was the smallest species of the genus Archaeospheniscus, being approximately 75-85 cm high, or about the size of a  Gentoo Penguin . It is also the oldest known species of its genus, as its remains were found in Middle or Late Eocene strata (34-50 MYA) of the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island, Antarctica. It is known from a fair number of bones. The species' binomen honors Carl Wiman, an early 20th century researcher who laid the groundwork for the classification of the prehistoric penguins.                                                                Marambiornis  (Late Eocene -? Early Oligocene of Seymour Island, Antarctica) -   Palaeeudyptinae, basal, new subfamily 1?            Mesetaornis  (Late   Eocene -? Early Oligocene of Seymour Island, Antarctica) - Palaeeudyptinae,   basal, new subfamily 1?            Tonniornis  (Late   Eocene -? Early Oligocene of Seymour Island, Antarctica)            Wimanornis  (Late   Eocene -? Early Oligocene of Seymour Island, Antarctica)            Duntroonornis  (Late Oligocene of Otago,  New Zealand ) - possibly Spheniscinae            Korora  (Late   Oligocene of S Canterbury,  New Zealand )            Platydyptes  (Late   Oligocene of  New Zealand ) - possibly not monophyletic; Palaeeudyptinae,   Paraptenodytinae or new subfamily?            Spheniscidae gen. et sp. indet (Late Oligocene/Early Miocene of Hakataramea,    New Zealand )            Madrynornis  (Puerto Madryn Late Miocene of Argentina) - possibly Spheniscinae            Pseudaptenodytes  (Late Miocene/Early   Pliocene) : The extinct penguin genus Pseudaptenodytes contains the type species P. macraei; smaller bones have been assigned to P. minor, although it is not certain whether they are really from a different species or simply of younger individuals; both taxa are known by an insufficient selection of bones. The fossils of Pseudaptenodytes have been found in deposits in Victoria ( Australia ) which are of Late Miocene or Early Pliocene age.           Dege  (Early   Pliocene of South Africa) - possibly Spheniscinae            Marplesornis  (Early Pliocene) - possibly Spheniscinae            Nucleornis  (Early   Pliocene of Duinfontain, South Africa) - possibly Spheniscinae            Inguza  (Late Pliocene) -   probably Spheniscinae; formerly  Spheniscus predemersus  : Inguza predemersus is an extinct species of penguin. It was formerly placed in the genus Spheniscus and presumed to be a close relative of the  African Penguin , but after its well-distinct tarsometatarsus was found, it was moved into its present monotypic genus. What is known from molecular data is that the time at which the present species lived is not too distant from the arrival of the ancestors of the  African Penguin  on the Atlantic coasts of southern Africa. On the other hand, it may be closer to  Pygoscelis . This would mean that its ancestors diverged from those of the extant  Pygoscelis  most likely at an indeterminate point of time during the Oligocene.(Baker et al. 2006) Alternatively, it might not be close to extant penguins (the Spheniscinae), but a late survivor of an extant lineage. This is not very likely given its age - it would be the last known survivor of the non-spheniscine penguins - but as some of these still lived a few million years ago, it cannot be ruled out.                      Family Spheniscidae                       Subfamily Palaeeudyptinae  - Giant penguins (fossil)             : The New Zealand Giant Penguins, Palaeeudyptinae, are an extinct subfamily of penguins. It includes several genera of medium-sized to very large species - including Palaeeudyptes marplesi and Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi which grew 1.5 meters (4 ft 11.1 in) tall or even larger, and the massive Pachydyptes ponderosus which weighed at least as much as an adult human male. They belonged to an evolutionary lineage more primitive than modern penguins. In some taxa at least, the wing, while already having lost the avian feathering, had not yet transformed into the semi-rigid flipper found in modern penguin species: While the ulna and the radius were already flattened to increase propelling capacity, the elbow and wrist joints still retained a higher degree of flexibility than the more rigidly lockable structure found in modern genera. The decline and eventual disappearance of this subfamily seems to be connected by increased competition as mammal groups such as cetaceans and pinnipeds became better-adapted to a marine lifestyle in the Oligocene and Miocene. The members of this subfamily are known from fossils found in  New Zealand , Antarctica, and possibly Australia, dating from the Middle or Late Eocene to the Late Oligocene; the Australian Middle Miocene genus Anthropodyptes is also often assigned to this subfamily, as are the remaining genera of primitive penguins except those from Patagonia. Indeed, it was long assumed that all prehistoric penguins which cannot be assigned to extant genera belonged into the Palaeeudyptinae; this view is generally considered obsolete today. It is likely that some of the unassigned  New Zealand / Antarctican/ Australian genera like Delphinornis, Marambiornis, and Mesetaornis do indeed belong into this subfamily, but it is just as probable that others, such as Duntroonornis and Korora, represent another, smaller and possibly somewhat more advanced lineage. The Palaeeudyptinae as originally defined (Simpson, 1946) contained only the namesake genus, the remainder being placed in the Anthropornithidae. The arrangement followed here is based on the review of Marples (1962) who synonymized the two, with updates to incorporate more current findings.                                Crossvallia  (Cross   Valley Late Paleocene of Seymour Island, Antarctica) - tentatively assigned to   this subfamily                  Anthropornis  (Middle Eocene ?- Early Oligocene of Seymour Island, Antarctica) - tentatively   assigned to this subfamily                                          Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin,   Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi  : Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi, or Nordenskjoeld's Giant Penguin, was a penguin species that lived 45–37 million years ago, during the Late Eocene and the earliest part of the Oligocene. It reached 1.7 meters (5 ft 6.9 in) in height and 90 kilograms (198 lb) in weight. Fossils of it have been found on Seymour Island off the coast of Antarctica and in  New Zealand . By comparison, the largest modern penguin species, the  Emperor Penguin , is just 1.2 meters (3 ft 11.2 in) tall. Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi had a bent joint in the wing; this indicates a carryover from its flying ancestors. Penguins were descended from grebe or loon-like ancestors, and became flightless as they became full-time swimmers.                                                    Icadyptes  (Late Eocene   of Atacama Desert, Peru) : Icadyptes salasi was a giant penguin species from the late Eocene period, in the tropics of South America. ""Ica"" for the Peruvian region where it was found, ""dyptes"" from the Greek word for diver, and ""salasi"" for Rodolfo Salas, a noted Peruvian paleontologist. The fossilised remains of the penguin, which lived some 36 million years ago, were found in the coastal desert of Peru by the team of North Carolina State University palaeontologist Dr. Julia Clarke, assistant professor of marine, earth and atmospheric sciences. Its well-preserved fossil skeleton was found on the southern coast of Peru together with an early Eocene species Perudyptes devriesi (comparable in size to the living  King penguin ), and the remains of three other previously undescribed penguin species, all of which seem to have preferred the tropics over colder latitudes. Perudyptes devriesi is named after the country, and Thomas DeVries, a University of Washington palaeontologist who has long worked in Peru. Standing 1.5 metres (5 ft) tall, the penguin was much larger than any of its modern-day cousins. It had an exceptionally long spear-like beak resembling that of a heron. The researchers who discovered the penguins believe the long, pointed beaks to be the likely ancestral shape for all penguins. Icadyptes salasi is the third largest penguin ever described.  Icadyptes salasi and Perudyptes devriesi appear to have flourished at warmer latitudes at a time when world temperatures were at their warmest over the past 65 million years. Only a few modern-day penguins, such as the African and Galapagos penguins prefer such a balmy climate. The discovery of the fossils has caused a re-evaluation of penguin evolution and expansion. Previously, scientists believed that penguins evolved near the poles in Antarctica and  New Zealand , and moved closer to the equator around 10 million years ago. Since Icadyptes salasi lived in Peru during a period of great warmth, penguins must have adapted to warm-climates around 30 million years earlier than previously believed.                  Palaeeudyptes  (Middle/Late Eocene - Late Oligocene) - polyphyletic; some belong in other   subfamilies : Palaeeudyptes is an extinct genus of large penguins, currently containing four accepted species. They were probably larger than almost all living penguins, with the smaller species being about the size of an  Emperor Penguin  and the largest ones having stood about 1.5 meters tall. Of the four species, two (P. gunnari and P. klekowskii) are known from numerous remains found in Middle or Late Eocene strata (34 to 50 MYA) of the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island, Antarctica. P. antarcticus, the first fossil penguin described, is only really known from a single incomplete tarsometatarsus found in the Late Oligocene Otekaike Limestone (23 to 28, possibly up to 34 MYA) at Kakanui,  New Zealand , but numerous other bones have been tentatively assigned to the species. The other described  New Zealand  species, P. marplesi, is known from parts of a skeleton, mainly leg bones, from the Middle or Late Eocene Burnside Mudstone (34 to 40 MYA) at Burnside, Dunedin. To this species also a number of additional remains have been tentatively assigned. The problem with the indeterminate  New Zealand  specimens is that they at least in part are intermediate in size between the two species (Simpson, 1971). It may be that P. marplesi simply evolved into the smaller P. antarcticus. Bones unassignable to species also were found on Seymour Island, but in these cases they seem to be from juvenile individuals or are simply too damaged to be of diagnostic value (Jadwiszczak, 2006). In addition, an incomplete right tibiotarsus (South Australian Museum P10862) and one left humerus (South Australian Museum P7158) and assignable to this genus were found in the Late Eocene Blanche Point Marls at Witton Bluff near Adelaide, Australia (Simpson, 1946, 1971). The supposed genus Wimanornis, based on two Seymour Island humeri, is apparently a synonym of P. gunnari (Jadwiszcak, 2006). The genus is the namesake for the subfamily of primitive penguins, Palaeeudyptinae. Altogether, their osteological characteristics seem to have been somewhat less advanced that those of the slightly smaller Archaeospheniscus and about on par with the gigantic Anthropornis. The exact nature of the relationship of the Palaeeudyptinae to modern penguins is unknown.                  Pachydyptes  (Late   Eocene) : Pachydyptes is an extinct genus of penguin. It contains the single species Pachydyptes ponderosus, the New Zealand Giant Penguin. This taxon is known from a few bones from Late Eocene (34 to 37 MYA) rocks in the area of Otago, and a fine specimen found near Kawhia,  New Zealand , in January 2006[verification needed]. With a height of 140 to 160 cm (about 5 ft) and weighing around 80 to possibly over 100 kg, it was the second-tallest penguin ever, surpassed only by Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi in size, but probably not in weight. As George Gaylord Simpson famously quipped, ""Pachydyptes' height would not suffice for basketball but their weight was about right for American football."" Pachydyptes was slightly larger than Icadyptes salasi, the best-identified of the giant penguins.                  Anthropodyptes  (Middle Miocene) -   tentatively assigned to this subfamily : Anthropodyptes is a poorly known monotypic genus of extinct penguin. It contains the single species Anthropodyptes gilli, known from a Middle Miocene humerus from Australia. The bone is somewhat similar to those found in members of the  New Zealand  genus Archaeospheniscus and thus this genus might, like them, belong to the subfamily Palaeeudyptinae. [edit] References                                       Subfamily Paraptenodytinae  - Stout-legged penguins (fossil)                                Arthrodytes  (San   Julian Late Eocene/Early Oligocene - Patagonia Early Miocene of Patagonia,   Argentina)                  Paraptenodytes  (Early - Late Miocene/Early   Pliocene) : Paraptenodytes is an extinct genus of penguins which contains two or three species sized between a  Magellanic Penguin  and a small  Emperor Penguin  (P. antarcticus). They are known from fossil bones ranging from a partial skeleton and some additional material in the case of P. antarcticus, and a single humerus in the case of P. brodkorbi. The latter species is therefore often considered invalid; Bertelli et al. (2006) think that it is indeed valid, but distinct enough not to belong into Paraptenodytes. The fossils were found in the Santa Cruz and Chubut Provinces of Patagonia, Argentina, in Patagonian Molasse Formation rocks of Early Miocene age; later occurrences are apparently from Late Miocene or possibly even Early Pliocene deposits (Stucchi et al. 2003). Together with the related genus Arthrodytes, they form the subfamily Paraptenodytinae, which is not an ancestor of modern penguins (Bertelli et al., 2006                                        Subfamily Palaeospheniscinae  - Slender-legged   penguins (fossil)             : Palaeospheniscus is an extinct genus of penguins which contains three species at present.

(2003) and Ksepka  et al.  (2006)   apply the phylogenetic taxon  Spheniscidae  what here is referred to as  Spheniscinae . Furthermore, they restrict the   phylogenetic taxon  Sphenisciformes  to flightless taxa, and establish   (Clarke  et al.  2003) the phylogenetic taxon  Pansphenisciformes  as   equivalent to the Linnean taxon  Sphenisciformes , i.e.,   including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. Given   that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the   placement of the penguins in the avian phylogeny is presently resolved, this seems spurious   and in any case is confusing; the established Linnean system is thus followed   here.         Evolution     The evolutionary history of   penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary biogeography; though as penguin   bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the alpha taxonomy of many   prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about   penguin prehistory have been published since 2005 (Bertelli & Giannini 2005, Baker  et al.  2006, Ksepka  et al.  2006, Slack  et al.  2006), the evolution of the   living genera can be considered resolved by now.     According to the comprehensive review of the available evidence by Ksepka  et al.  (2006), the basal penguins lived around the time   of the Cretaceous–Tertiary   extinction event somewhere in the general area of (southern)  New Zealand  and Byrd Land, Antarctica. Due to plate tectonics, these   areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometers (932 mi) apart rather than   the 4,000 kilometers (2,486 mi) of today. The most recent common ancestor of   penguins and their sister   clade can be roughly dated to the Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary, around 70-68 mya (Baker  et al.  2006, Slack  et al.  2006). What can be said as certainly as possible   in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the Cretaceous, the penguin lineage   must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so morphologically; it is fairly likely   that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds   have generally low resilience to the breakdown of trophic webs which follows the initial phase of   mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities ( see   also   Flightless Cormorant ).         Origin and systematics of modern   penguins     Modern penguins consititute two undisputed clades and another two more basal genera with more   ambiguous relationships (Bertelli & Giannini 2005). The origin of the   Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must   have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the   oceans between the Australia- New Zealand  region and the Antarctic (Baker  et   al.  2006). Presumedly diverging from other penguins around 40 mya (Baker  et al.  2006), it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time   limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the Antarctic   Peninsula and Patagonia have   not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine   lineages are those with the most southern distribution.     The genus  Aptenodytes  appears to be the basalmost divergence among   living penguins; they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches,   incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch, they are   almost naked. This genus has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and   barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.     Pygoscelis  contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head   pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered on Antarctic coasts but   extending somewhat northwards from there. In external morphology, these apparently still   resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as  Aptenodytes'  autapomorphies are in most cases   fairly pronounced adaptations related to that genus'   extreme habitat conditions. As the   former genus,  Pygoscelis  seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, but the   range expansion and radiation which lead to the present-day diversity probably   did not occur until much later, around the Burdigalian stage of the Early Miocene, roughly 20-15 mya (Baker  et al.  2006).     The genera  Spheniscus  and  Eudyptula  contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution   centered on South   America; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack carotenoid coloration, and the   former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living   penguins in nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current out   of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the Chattian (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28   mya (Baker  et al.  2006). While the two genera separated during this time,   the present-day diversity is the result of a Pliocene radiation, taking place some 4-2 mya (Baker  et al.  2006).     The  Megadyptes  -  Eudyptes  clade occurs at similar latitudes (though not as far north as   the  Galapagos   Penguin ), has its highest diversity in the  New Zealand  region, and represent   a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head   feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged   apparently in the Middle Miocene (Langhian, roughly 15-14 mya), but again, the living   species of  Eudyptes  are the product of a later radiation, stretching from   about the late Tortonian (Late   Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene (Baker  et al.  2006).     It is most interesting to note that the geographical and temporal pattern or   spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of global cooling documented   in the paleoclimatic   record (Baker  et al.  2006). The emergence of the subantarctic lineage   at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of   cooling that eventually led to the ice   ages some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts   declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins   existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably,   the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar   flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on   the other facilitating the eastward expansion of  Spheniscus  to South   America and eventually beyond (Baker  et al.  2006).     Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the Middle Miocene Climate   Transition, a sharp drop in global average temperature from 14 to 12 mya,   and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the   Tortonian, the Antarctic ice sheet was already much like   today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's subantarctic   penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate   shifts.         Relationship to other bird orders     Penguin ancestry beyond  Waimanu  remains unknown and not well resolved   by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the   strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived   fairly close relationship between penguins and  grebes  is almost certainly an error based on both groups'   strong diving adaptations, which are homoplasies. On the other hand, different DNA sequence datasets do not   agree in detail with each other either.     What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except paleognaths and  fowl ) which comprises what is sometimes   called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient waterfowl. This group contains such   birds as  storks ,  rails , and the seabirds, with the possible exception of the Charadriiformes (Fain   & Houde 2004).     Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the   analysis and dataset, a close relationship to Ciconiiformes (e.g. Slack  et al.  2006) or   to Procellariiformes (Baker  et al.  2006)   has been suggested. Some (e.g. Mayr 2005) think the penguin-like plotopterids (usually   considered relatives of  anhingas  and  cormorants ) may actually be a   sister group of the penguins, and that penguins may have ultimately shared a   common ancestor with the Pelecaniformes and consequently would have to be   included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other   pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the   traditional Pelecaniformes in three.     The  Auk  of the Northern   Hemisphere is superficially similar to penguins, they are not related to the   penguins at all, but considered by some to be a product of moderate convergent   evolution.

The 10,000 living species of  birds  have been  classified  as dinosaurs.   The term ""dinosaur"" was coined in 1842 by  Sir Richard Owen  and derives from  Greek     ( deinos ) ""terrible, powerful, wondrous"" +    ( sauros ) ""lizard"". It is sometimes used informally to describe other  prehistoric reptiles , such as the  pelycosaur   Dimetrodon , the winged  pterosaurs , and the aquatic  ichthyosaurs ,  plesiosaurs  and  mosasaurs , although none of these animals were dinosaurs. Through the first half of the 20th century, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been slow, unintelligent  cold-blooded  animals. Most  research conducted since the 1970s , however, has supported the view that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. The resulting transformation in the scientific understanding of dinosaurs has gradually filtered into popular consciousness.   The 1861 discovery of the primitive bird  Archaeopteryx  first suggested a close relationship between dinosaurs and birds. Aside from the presence of fossilized feather impressions,  Archaeopteryx  was very similar to the contemporary small predatory dinosaur  Compsognathus . Research has since identified  theropod  dinosaurs as the most likely direct ancestors of  birds ; most paleontologists today regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs, and some suggest that dinosaurs and birds should be grouped into one biological class. [ 1 ]  Aside from birds,  crocodilians  are the only other close relatives of dinosaurs to have survived until the present day. Like dinosaurs and birds, crocodilians are members of  Archosauria , a group of  reptiles  that first appeared in the very late  Permian  and came to predominate in the mid-Triassic.   Since the first dinosaur  fossils  were recognized in the early  nineteenth century , mounted dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular. They have been featured in best-selling books and films (notably  Jurassic Park ), and new discoveries are regularly covered by the  media .

[ 2 ]  The term is derived from the  Greek  words  ( deinos  meaning ""terrible"", ""powerful"", or ""wondrous"") and  ( saura  meaning ""lizard"" or ""reptile""). [ 3 ]  Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty. [ 4 ]  In colloquial English ""dinosaur"" is sometimes used to describe an obsolete or unsuccessful thing or person, [ 5 ]  despite the dinosaurs' 160 million year reign and the global abundance and diversity of their descendants, the birds.     Modern definition           Triceratops   skeleton  at the  American Museum of Natural History  in New York City.       Under  phylogenetic taxonomy , dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of "" Triceratops ,  Neornithes  [modern birds], their  most recent common ancestor , and all descendants."" [ 6 ]  It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the most recent common ancestor of  Megalosaurus  and  Iguanodon , because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria. [ 7 ]  Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs, including  theropods  (mostly  bipedal   carnivores ),  sauropodomorphs  (mostly large  herbivorous   quadrupeds  with long necks and tails),  ankylosaurians  (armored herbivorous quadrupeds),  stegosaurians  (plated herbivorous quadrupeds),  ceratopsians  (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), and  ornithopods  (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including ""duck-bills""). These definitions are written to correspond with scientific conceptions of dinosaurs that predate the modern use of phylogenetics. The continuity of meaning is intended to prevent confusion about what the term ""dinosaur"" means.   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict  cladistical  definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor must be included in a group for that group to be natural, birds  are  dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup  Maniraptora , which are  coelurosaurs , which are theropods, which are  saurischians , which are dinosaurs. [ 8 ]   From the point of view of cladistics, birds are dinosaurs, but in ordinary speech the word ""dinosaur"" does not include birds. Additionally, referring to dinosaurs that are not birds as ""non-avian dinosaurs"" is cumbersome. For clarity, this article will use ""dinosaur"" as a synonym for ""non-avian dinosaur"". The term ""non-avian dinosaur"" will be used for emphasis as needed. It is also technically correct to refer to dinosaurs as a distinct group under the older  Linnaean classification  system, which accepts  paraphyletic  taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor.     General description           Stegosaurus  skeleton,  Field Museum ,  Chicago .       Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs (aside from birds) can be generally described as terrestrial  archosaurian   reptiles  with  limbs held erect beneath the body , that existed from the  Late Triassic  (first appearing in the  Carnian   faunal stage ) to the  Late Cretaceous  (going extinct at the end of the  Maastrichtian ). [ 9 ]  Many prehistoric animals are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and  Dimetrodon , but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs. Marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs were neither terrestrial nor archosaurs; pterosaurs were archosaurs but not terrestrial; and  Dimetrodon  was a  Permian  animal more closely related to mammals. [ 10 ]  Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the  Jurassic  and Cretaceous. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded the size of a cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey. [ 11 ]  One notable exception is  Repenomamus giganticus , a  triconodont  weighing between 12 kilograms (26 lb) and 14 kilograms (31 lb) that is known to have eaten small dinosaurs like young  Psittacosaurus . [ 12 ]   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1,850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. [ 13 ]  An earlier study predicted that about 3,400 dinosaur genera existed, including many which would not have been preserved in the fossil record. [ 14 ]  As of September 17, 2008, 1,047 different species of dinosaurs have been named. [ 15 ]  Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds, and others, such as  Ammosaurus  and  Iguanodon , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Many had  bony armor , or cranial modifications like horns and crests. Although known for large size, many dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller. Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including  Antarctica . [ 16 ]  No dinosaurs are known to have lived in marine or aerial habitats, although it is possible some feathered theropods were flyers.     Distinguishing features   While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral  archosaurian  skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common features across a taxonomic group are called  synapomorphies .   Dinosaur synapomorphies include an elongated crest on the  humerus , or upper arm bone, to accommodate the attachment of  deltopectoral  muscles; a shelf at the rear of the  ilium , or main hip bone; a  tibia , or shin bone, featuring a broad lower edge and a flange pointing out and to the rear; and an ascending projection on the  astragalus , one of the ankle bones, which secures it to the tibia. [ 17 ]           Edmontonia  was an ""armored dinosaur"" of the group  Ankylosauria .       A variety of other skeletal features were shared by many dinosaurs. However, because they were either common to other groups of  archosaurs  or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as  diapsid  reptiles, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of  temporal fenestrae  (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the  snout  and lower jaw. [ 18 ]  Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated  scapula , or shoulder blade; a  sacrum  composed of three or more fused  vertebrae  (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in  Herrerasaurus ); [ 17 ]  and an  acetabulum , or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in  Saturnalia , for example). [ 19 ]  Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the Late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature. [ 20 ]          Hip joints and hindlimb postures.       Dinosaurs stood erect in a manner similar to  most modern mammals , but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side. [ 21 ]  Their posture was due to the development of a laterally-facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly-facing distinct head on the femur. [ 22 ]  Their erect posture enabled dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that  surpassed those of ""sprawling"" reptiles . [ 23 ]  Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs. [ 24 ]  Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including  rauisuchians , also had erect limbs but achieved this by a ""pillar erect"" configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the  upper pelvic bone  was rotated to form an overhanging shelf. [ 24 ]     Natural history     Origins and early evolution   Main article:  Evolution of dinosaurs           Eoraptor , an early dinosaur genus.       For a long time many scientists thought dinosaurs were  polyphyletic  with multiple groups of unrelated ""dinosaurs"" evolving due to similar pressures, [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  but dinosaurs are now known to have formed a single group. [ 28 ] [ 17 ]   Dinosaurs diverged from their  archosaur  ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late  Triassic  period, roughly 20 million years after the  Permian-Triassic extinction event  wiped out an estimated 95% of all  life on Earth . [ 29 ] [ 30 ]   Radiometric dating  of the  rock formation  that contained fossils from the early dinosaur  genus   Eoraptor  establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists believe  Eoraptor  resembles the  common ancestor  of all dinosaurs; [ 31 ]  if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal  predators . [ 32 ]  The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like  ornithodirans  such as  Marasuchus  and  Lagerpeton  in  Argentinian   Middle Triassic  strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.   When dinosaurs appeared, terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of basal archosaurs and  therapsids , such as  aetosaurs ,  cynodonts ,  dicynodonts ,  ornithosuchids ,  rauisuchias , and  rhynchosaurs . Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, in one of two events. First, at about the boundary between the  Carnian  and  Norian   faunal stages  (about 215 million years ago), dicynodonts and a variety of basal  archosauromorphs , including the  prolacertiforms  and rhynchosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the  Triassic-Jurassic extinction event  (about 200 million years ago), that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids,  phytosaurs , and rauisuchians. These losses left behind a land fauna of  crocodylomorphs , dinosaurs,  mammals ,  pterosaurians , and  turtles . [ 17 ]   The first few lines of primitive dinosaurs  diversified  through the  Carnian  and  Norian   stages  of the Triassic, most likely by occupying the niches of groups that became extinct. Traditionally, dinosaurs were thought to have  replaced  the variety of other Triassic land animals by proving superior through a long period of competition. This now appears unlikely, for several reasons. Dinosaurs do not show a pattern of steadily increasing in diversity and numbers, as would be predicted if they were competitively replacing other groups; instead, they were very rare through the Carnian, making up only 1-2% of individuals present in  faunas . In the Norian, however, after the extinction of several other groups, they became significant components of faunas, representing 50-90% of individuals. Also, what had been viewed as a key adaptation of dinosaurs, their erect stance, is now known to have present in several contemporaneous groups that were not as successful (aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, rauisuchians, and some groups of crocodylomorphs). Finally, the Late Triassic itself was a time of great upheaval in life, with shifts in plant life, marine life, and climate. [ 17 ]   Crurotarsans , today represented only by crocodilians but in the Late Triassic also encompassing such now-extinct groups as aetosaurs, phytosaurs, ornithosuchians, and rauisuchians, were actually more diverse in the Late Triassic than dinosaurs, indicating that the survival of dinosaurs had more to do with luck than superiority. [ 33 ]     Low diversification in the Cretaceous   Statistical analyses based on raw data suggest that dinosaurs diversified, i.e. the number of species increased, in the Late  Cretaceous . However in July 2008 Graeme T. Lloyd  et al.  argued that this apparent diversification was an illusion caused by  sampling bias , because Late Cretaceous rocks have been very heavily studied. Instead, they wrote, dinosaurs underwent only two significant diversifications in the Late Cretaceous, the initial  radiations  of the  euhadrosaurs  and  ceratopsians . In the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previous been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites  (fossilized dung) indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Meanwhile  herbivorous  insects and  mammals  diversified rapidly to take advantage of the new type of plant food, while lizards, snakes,  crocodilians  and  birds  also diversified at the same time. Lloyd  et al.  suggest that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Classification   Main article:  Dinosaur classification   Dinosaurs (including birds) are  archosaurs , like modern  crocodilians . Archosaurs'  diapsid  skulls have two holes, called  temporal fenestrae , located where the jaw muscles attach, and an additional  antorbital fenestra  in front of the eyes. Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called  synapsids ; and  turtles , with no temporal fenestra, are  anapsids . Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side.   Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a  superorder  or an unranked  clade . They are divided into two  orders ,  Saurischia  and  Ornithischia , depending upon  pelvic  structure. Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with  birds  than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all  taxa  sharing a more recent common ancestor with  Triceratops  than with Saurischia. Saurischians ('lizard-hipped', from the  Greek   sauros  (  ) meaning 'lizard' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') retained the hip structure of their ancestors, with a  pubis  bone directed  cranially , or forward. [ 22 ]  This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups ( Herrerasaurus , [ 35 ]   therizinosauroids , [ 36 ]   dromaeosaurids , [ 37 ]  and  birds [ 8 ] ). Saurischia includes the  theropods  (bipedal and mostly carnivores, except for birds) and  sauropodomorphs  (long-necked quadrupedal  herbivores ).   By contrast, ornithischians ('bird-hipped', from the  Greek   ornitheios  (  ) meaning 'of a bird' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird's pelvis: the  pubis  bone was oriented  caudally  (rear-pointing). Unlike birds, the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward-pointing process. Ornithischia includes a variety of herbivores. ( NB:  the terms ""lizard hip"" and ""bird-hip"" are misnomers  birds evolved from dinosaurs with ""lizard hips"".)

In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass  Pangaea , there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of  coelophysoid   carnivores  and  prosauropod   herbivores . [ 38 ]   Gymnosperm  plants (particularly  conifers ), a potential food source, radiated in the Late Triassic. Prosauropods did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. [ 39 ]  The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of  ceratosaurians ,  spinosauroids , and  carnosaurians , and herbivores consisting of  stegosaurian  ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the  Morrison Formation  of North America and  Tendaguru Beds  of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized  sinraptorid  theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like  Mamenchisaurus . [ 38 ]   Ankylosaurians  and  ornithopods  were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and  pteridophytes  were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential  cheek -like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. [ 39 ]  Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians . [ 8 ]          An Illustration of 18 species of basal ceratopsia to scale.       By the Early Cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians,  iguanodontians , and  brachiosaurids  through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large  spinosaurid  and  carcharodontosaurid  theropods, and  rebbachisaurid  and  titanosaurian  sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia,  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians  like  dromaeosaurids ,  troodontids , and  oviraptorosaurians  became the common theropods, and  ankylosaurids  and early  ceratopsians  like  Psittacosaurus  became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians,  hypsilophodonts , and iguanodontians. [ 38 ]  The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early Late Cretaceous. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of  flowering plants . At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries, taken to its extreme in  hadrosaurids . [ 39 ]  Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid  Nigersaurus . [ 40 ]   There were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were  tyrannosaurids  and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and  pachycephalosaurians . In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting  Gondwana ,  abelisaurids  were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids,  rhabdodontid  iguanodontians,  nodosaurid  ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent. [ 38 ]  Flowering plants were greatly radiating, [ 39 ]  with the first grasses appearing by the end of the Cretaceous. [ 41 ]  Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia. Theropods were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores, with  therizinosaurians  and  ornithomimosaurians  becoming common. [ 39 ]   The  CretaceousTertiary extinction event , which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the birds. Some other  diapsid  groups, such as crocodylians,  lizards ,  snakes ,  sphenodontians , and  choristoderans , also survived the event. [ 42 ]     Paleobiology   Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil records, including  fossilized   bones ,  feces ,  trackways ,  gastroliths ,  feathers , impressions of skin,  internal organs  and  soft tissues . [ 43 ] [ 44 ]  Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including  physics  (especially  biomechanics ),  chemistry ,  biology , and the  earth sciences  (of which  paleontology  is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.     Size   Main article:  Dinosaur size          Scale diagram comparing the largest known dinosaurs in four  suborders  and a human.       While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the  sauropods  were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an  order of magnitude  more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric  mammals  such as the  Indricotherium  and the Columbian  mammoth  were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach or surpass them in size  most notably the  blue whale , which reaches up to 173,000 kilograms (381,000 lb) and over 30 meters (100 ft) in length. [ 45 ]  There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but it may be that the most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in  rock formations  interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments. [ 46 ]   Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. [ 31 ]  Theropod dinosaurs, when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on  order of magnitude , most often fall into the 100 to 1,000 kilogram (220 to 2,200 lb) category, whereas  recent  predatory  carnivorans  peak in the 10 to 100 kilogram (22 to 220 lb) category. [ 47 ]  The  mode  of dinosaur body masses is between one and ten metric tonnes. [ 48 ]  This contrasts sharply with the size of  Cenozoic  mammals, estimated by the  National Museum of Natural History  as about 2 to 5 kilograms (5 to 10 lb). [ 49 ]     Largest and smallest   Only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the  largest and smallest dinosaurs .          Comparative size of  Brachiosaurus .       The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is  Brachiosaurus brancai  (also known as  Giraffatitan ). Its remains were discovered in  Tanzania  between 190712. Bones from multiple similarly-sized individuals were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the  Humboldt Museum  of  Berlin ; [ 50 ]  this mount is 12 meters (39 ft) tall and 22.5 meters (74 ft) long, and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between 30,000 and 60,000 kilograms (70,000 and 130,000 lb). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 m (89 ft) long  Diplodocus , which was discovered in  Wyoming  in the  United States  and displayed in  Pittsburgh's   Carnegie Natural History Museum  in 1907.          Comparative size of  Eoraptor .       There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils. Most of the largest  herbivorous  specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive  Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed 80,000 to 100,000 kilograms (90 to 110 short tons); some of the longest, the 33.5 meters (110 ft) long  Diplodocus hallorum [ 46 ]  (formerly  Seismosaurus ) and the 33 meters (110 ft) long  Supersaurus ; [ 51 ]  and the tallest, the 18 meters (59 ft)  Sauroposeidon , which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The longest of them all may have been  Amphicoelias fragillimus , known only from a now lost partial vertebral  neural arch  described in 1878. Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone, the animal may have been 58 meters (190 ft) long and weighed over 120,000 kilograms (260,000 lb), [ 46 ]  heavier than all known dinosaurs except possibly the poorly known  Bruhathkayosaurus , which could have weighed 175,000 to 220,000 kilograms (400,000 to 500,000 lb). The largest known  carnivorous  dinosaur was  Spinosaurus , reaching a length of 16 to 18 meters (50 to 60 ft), and weighing in at 8,150 kilograms (18,000 lb). [ 52 ]  Other large meat-eaters included  Giganotosaurus ,  Mapusaurus ,  Tyrannosaurus rex  and  Carcharodontosaurus .   Not including modern birds, the smallest dinosaurs known were about the size of a  pigeon . [ 53 ]  The theropods  Anchiornis  and  Epidexipteryx  both had a total skeletal length of under 35 centimeters (1.1 ft). [ 54 ] [ 53 ]   Anchiornis  is currently the smallest dinosaur described from an adult specimen, with an estimated weight of 110 grams. [ 54 ]  The smallest herbivorous dinosaurs included  Microceratus  and  Wannanosaurus , at about 60 cm long (2 ft) each. [ 55 ] [ 56 ]     Behavior          A nesting ground of  Maiasaura  was discovered in 1978.       Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their  habitat ,  computer simulations  of their  biomechanics , and comparisons with modern animals in similar  ecological niches . As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.   The first potential evidence of  herding  behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31  Iguanodon  dinosaurs which were then thought to have perished together in  Bernissart ,  Belgium , after they fell into a deep, flooded  sinkhole  and drowned. [ 57 ]  Other mass death sites have been subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that  duck-bills  (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the  American Bison  or the African  Springbok . Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in  Oxfordshire , England, [ 58 ]  although there is not evidence for specific herd structures. [ 59 ]  Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for  migratory  purposes, or to provide protection for their young. There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in  Inner Mongolia  that has yielded the remains of over twenty  Sinornithomimus , from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud. [ 60 ]  The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as  pack hunters  working together to bring down large prey. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  However, this lifestyle is uncommon among the modern relatives of dinosaurs ( crocodiles  and other reptiles, and  birds  -  Harris's Hawk  is a well-documented exception), and the  taphonomic  evidence suggesting pack hunting in such theropods as  Deinonychus  and  Allosaurus  can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern  diapsid  predators. [ 63 ]          Fossilized egg of the  oviraptorid   Citipati ,  American Museum of Natural History .       Jack Horner's  1978 discovery of a  Maiasaura  (""good mother dinosaur"")  nesting  ground in  Montana  demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the  ornithopods . [ 64 ]  There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like  Patagonian   titanosaurian  sauropods (1997 discovery), also nested in large groups. [ 65 ]  The  Mongolian   oviraptorid   Citipati  was discovered in a  chicken -like  brooding  position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the  eggs  warm. [ 66 ]  Parental care is also implied by other finds. For example, the fossilized remains of a grouping of  Psittacosaurus  has been found, consisting of one adult and 34 juveniles; in this case, the large number of juveniles may be due to communal nesting. [ 67 ]  Additionally, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the  prosauropod   Massospondylus ) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur. [ 68 ]  Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the  Isle of Skye  in northwestern  Scotland . [ 69 ]  Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.          Artist's rendering of two  Centrosaurus , herbivorous  ceratopsid  dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous fauna of North America.       The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the  marginocephalians ,  theropods  and  lambeosaurines , may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and  territorialism . Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations. [ 70 ]  The nature of dinosaur  communication  also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent studies suggest that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as  resonance chambers  used for a wide range of  vocalizations . [ 71 ] [ 72 ]   From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the  Gobi Desert  in 1971. It included a  Velociraptor  attacking a  Protoceratops , [ 73 ]  providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. [ 74 ]  Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially-healed tail of an  Edmontosaurus , a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. [ 74 ]   Cannibalism  amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod  Majungasaurus . [ 75 ]   Based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as  Oryctodromeus , some herbivorous species seem to have led a partially  fossorial  (burrowing) lifestyle, [ 76 ]  and some bird-like species may have been  arboreal  (tree-climbing), most notably primitive  dromaeosaurids  such as  Microraptor [ 77 ]  and the enigmatic  scansoriopterygids . [ 78 ]  However, most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of  biomechanics , in particular, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, [ 79 ]  whether  diplodocids  could create  sonic booms  via  whip -like tail snapping, [ 80 ]  and whether sauropods could float. [ 81 ]     Physiology   Main article:  Physiology of dinosaurs           Tyrannosaurus rex  skull and upper vertebral column, Palais de la Dcouverte, Paris.       A vigorous debate on the subject of temperature regulation in dinosaurs has been ongoing since the 1960s. Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur  endotherm  has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation.   After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were  ectothermic  creatures: ""terrible  lizards "" as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness implied that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, comparable to modern reptiles, which need external sources of heat in order to regulate their body temperature. Dinosaur ectothermy remained a prevalent view until  Robert T. ""Bob"" Bakker , an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968.   Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (perhaps aided by the animals' bulk). Evidence of  endotherm  in dinosaurs includes the discovery of  polar dinosaurs in Australia  and  Antarctica  (where they would have experienced a cold, dark six-month winter), the discovery of dinosaurs whose feathers may have provided regulatory insulation, and analysis of blood-vessel structures that are typical of endotherms within dinosaur bone. Skeletal structures suggest that theropods and other dinosaurs had active lifestyles better suited to an endothermic cardiovascular system, while sauropods exhibit fewer endothermic characteristics. It is certainly possible that some dinosaurs were endothermic while others were not. Scientific debate over the specifics continues. [ 82 ]           Eubrontes , a dinosaur footprint in the Lower  Jurassic  Moenave Formation at the St. George Dinosaur Discovery Site at Johnson Farm, southwestern Utah.       Complicating the debate is the fact that warm-bloodedness can emerge based on more than one mechanism. Most discussions of dinosaur endothermy tend to compare them to average birds or mammals, which expend energy to elevate body temperature above that of the environment. Small birds and mammals also possess  insulation , such as  fat ,  fur , or  feathers , which slows down heat loss. However, large mammals, such as elephants, face a different problem because of their relatively small ratio of surface area to volume ( Haldane's  principle). This ratio compares the volume of an animal with the area of its skin: as an animal gets bigger, its surface area increases more slowly than its volume. At a certain point, the amount of heat radiated away through the skin drops below the amount of heat produced inside the body, forcing animals to use additional methods to avoid overheating. In the case of elephants, they have little hair as adults, and have large ears which increase their surface area, and have behavioral adaptations as well (such as using the trunk to spray water on themselves and mud wallowing). These behaviors increase cooling through evaporation.   Large dinosaurs would presumably have had to deal with similar issues; their body size suggest they lost heat relatively slowly to the surrounding air, and so could have been what are called  inertial homeotherms , animals that are warmer than their environments through sheer size rather than through special adaptations like those of birds or mammals. However, so far this theory fails to account for the numerous dog- and goat-sized dinosaur species, or the young of larger species.   Modern  computerized tomography  (CT) scans of a  dinosaur 's chest cavity (conducted in 2000) found the apparent remnants of a four-chambered heart, much like those found in today's mammals and birds. [ 83 ]  The idea is controversial within the scientific community, coming under fire for bad anatomical science [ 84 ]  or simply wishful thinking. [ 85 ]  The question of how this find reflects on metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy may be moot, though, regardless of the object's identity: both modern  crocodilians  and  birds , the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well. [ 86 ]     Soft tissue and DNA           Scipionyx samniticus  fossil showing tissue impressions, at the  Museo Civico di Storia Naturale , in Milan, Italy.       One of the best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in  Petraroia ,  Italy . The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young  coelurosaur ,  Scipionyx  samniticus . The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur. [ 43 ]   In the March 2005 issue of  Science , the paleontologist  Mary Higby Schweitzer  and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old  Tyrannosaurus rex  leg  bone  from the  Hell Creek Formation  in  Montana . After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team. [ 44 ]   When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as  blood vessels , bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear; study and interpretation of the material is ongoing. [ 44 ]   Newer research, published in PloS One (30 July 2008), has challenged the claims that the material found is the soft tissue of  Tyrannosaurus . Thomas Kaye of the  University of Washington  and his co-authors contend that what was really inside the tyrannosaur bone was slimy  biofilm  created by bacteria that coated the voids once occupied by blood vessels and cells. [ 87 ]  The researchers found that what previously had been identified as remnants of blood cells, because of the presence of iron, were actually  framboids , microscopic mineral spheres bearing iron. They found similar spheres in a variety of other fossils from various periods, including an  ammonite . In the ammonite they found the spheres in a place where the iron they contain could not have had any relationship to the presence of blood. [ 88 ]   The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions, but upon further inspection and  peer review , neither of these reports could be confirmed. [ 89 ]  However, a functional visual  peptide  of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds. [ 90 ]  In addition, several  proteins  have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils, [ 91 ]  including hemoglobin. [ 92 ]   Even if dinosaur DNA could be reconstructed, it would be exceedingly difficult to clone and ""grow"" dinosaurs using current technology since no closely related species exist to provide  zygotes  or a suitable environment for  embryonic development .     Feathers and the origin of birds   Main article:  Origin of birds   The possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by  Thomas Henry Huxley . [ 93 ]  After the work of  Gerhard Heilmann  in the early 20th century, the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of generalized  thecodont  ancestors, with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of  clavicles  in dinosaurs. [ 94 ]  However, as later discoveries showed, clavicles (or a single fused  wishbone , which derived from separate clavicles) were not actually absent; [ 8 ]  they had been found as early as 1924 in  Oviraptor , but misidentified as an  interclavicle . [ 95 ]  In the 1970s,  John Ostrom  revived the dinosaur-bird theory, [ 96 ]  which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis, [ 97 ]  and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds. [ 18 ]  Of particular note has been the fossils of the  Yixian Formation , where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found, often with feathers of some type. [ 8 ]  Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives. [ 98 ]  They are most closely allied with  maniraptoran  coelurosaurs. [ 8 ]  A minority of scientists, most notably  Alan Feduccia  and  Larry Martin , have proposed other evolutionary paths, including revised versions of Heilmann's basal archosaur proposal, [ 99 ]  or that maniraptoran theropods are the ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs, only  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ]     Feathers   Main article:  Feathered dinosaurs          The famous Berlin Specimen of  Archaeopteryx lithographica .       Archaeopteryx , the first good example of a ""feathered dinosaur"", was discovered in 1861. The initial specimen was found in the  Solnhofen limestone  in southern Germany, which is a  lagersttte , a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils.  Archaeopteryx  is a  transitional fossil , with features clearly intermediate between those of modern reptiles and birds. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal  The Origin of Species , its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of  evolutionary biology  and  creationism . This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for  Compsognathus . [ 101 ]   Since the 1990s, a number of additional  feathered dinosaurs  have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the  lagersttte  of the Yixian Formation,  Liaoning , northeastern  China , which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found only in a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be due to the fact that delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by  fossilization  and thus are absent from the fossil record. To this point, protofeathers (thin, filament-like structures) are known from dinosaurs at the base of Coelurosauria, such as  compsognathids  like  Sinosauropteryx  and  tyrannosauroids  ( Dilong ), [ 102 ]  but barbed feathers are only known among the coelurosaur subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. [ 8 ] [ 103 ]  The description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that protofeathers are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' integument, [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with barbed feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ] [ 105 ]  However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the question of the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been raised. [ 107 ]     Skeleton   Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the  missing link  between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for  paleontologists . Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck,  pubis ,  wrist  (semi-lunate  carpal ), arm and  pectoral girdle , furcula (wishbone), and  breast bone . Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through  cladistic analysis  strengthens the case for the link.     Soft anatomy   Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation which was led by  Patrick O'Connor  of  Ohio University . The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their  skeletons , as is the case in birds. ""What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds"", O'Connor said. [ 108 ]  In a paper published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE (September 29, 2008), scientists described  Aerosteon riocoloradensis , the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like breathing system.  CT-scanning  revealed the evidence of air sacs within the body cavity of the  Aerosteon  skeleton. [ 109 ] [ 110 ]   Another piece of evidence that birds and dinosaurs are closely related is the use of  gizzard  stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with  fossils , gizzard stones are called  gastroliths . [ 111 ]     Reproductive biology   A discovery of features in a  Tyrannosaurus rex   skeleton  recently provided more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs between the hard outer bone and the  marrow . This  medullary  bone, which is rich in  calcium , is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally-derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the  Tyrannosaurus rex  specimen's hind limb suggested that  T. rex  used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female. [ 112 ]  Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod  Allosaurus  and ornithopod  Tenontosaurus . Because the line of dinosaurs that includes  Allosaurus  and  Tyrannosaurus  diverged from the line that led to  Tenontosaurus  very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue. Medullary bone has been found in specimens of sub-adult size, which suggests that dinosaurs reached sexual maturity rather quickly for such large animals. [ 113 ]     Behavioral evidence   A recently discovered  troodont  fossil demonstrates that some dinosaurs slept with their heads tucked under their arms. [ 114 ]  This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds.     Extinction   Main articles:  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  and  KT boundary   Non-avian dinosaurs suddenly became  extinct  approximately 65 million years ago. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including  ammonites  ( nautilus -like  mollusks ),  mosasaurs , plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, herbivorous  turtles  and  crocodiles , most birds, and many groups of mammals. [ 16 ]  This  mass extinction  is known as the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event . The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the general consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.   At the peak of the Mesozoic, there were no  polar ice caps , and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250 meters (300 to 800 ft) higher than they are today. The planet's temperature was also much more uniform, with only 25  C  (45  F ) separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator. On average, atmospheric temperatures were also much warmer; the poles, for example, were 50 C (90 F) warmer than today. [ 115 ] [ 116 ]   The atmosphere's composition during the Mesozoic was vastly different as well. Carbon dioxide levels were up to 12 times higher than today's levels, and oxygen formed 32 to 35% of the atmosphere, as compared to 21% today. However, by the late Cretaceous, the environment was changing dramatically. Volcanic activity was decreasing, which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably. Some scientists hypothesize that climate change, combined with lower oxygen levels, might have led directly to the demise of many species. If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds, it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency, given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies. [ 16 ]     Impact event   Main article:  Chicxulub crater          The  Chicxulub Crater  at the tip of the  Yucatn Peninsula ; the impactor that formed this crater may have caused the dinosaur extinction.       The asteroid collision theory, which was brought to wide attention in 1980 by  Walter Alvarez  and colleagues, links the  extinction event  at the end of the Cretaceous period to a  bolide  impact approximately 65.5 million years ago. Alvarez  et al.  proposed that a sudden increase in  iridium  levels, recorded around the world in the period's rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. [ 117 ]  The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a 5 to 15 kilometer (3 to 9 mi) wide  bolide  hit in the vicinity of the  Yucatn Peninsula , creating the 170 kilometers (110 mi) wide  Chicxulub Crater  and triggering the  mass extinction . [ 118 ]  Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the  impact event . Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave.   Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun).   In September 2007, U.S. researchers led by  William Bottke  of the  Southwest Research Institute  in  Boulder, Colorado , and  Czech  scientists used  computer  simulations to identify the probable source of the Chicxulub impact. They calculated a 90% probability that a giant asteroid named  Baptistina , approximately 160 kilometers (100 mi) in diameter, orbiting in the asteroid belt which lies between  Mars  and  Jupiter , was struck by a smaller unnamed asteroid about 55 kilometers (35 mi) in diameter about 160 million years ago. The impact shattered Baptistina, creating a cluster which still exists today as the  Baptistina family . Calculations indicate that some of the fragments were sent hurtling into earth-crossing orbits, one of which was the 10 kilometers (6 mi) wide  meteorite  which struck  Mexico 's  Yucatan   peninsula  65 million years ago, creating the  Chicxulub crater  (175 kilometers (110 mi)). [ 119 ]   While similar to Alvarez's impact theory (which involved a single asteroid or comet), this theory proposes that ""passages of the  solar companion star Nemesis  through the  Oort comet cloud  would trigger comet showers."" [ 120 ]  One or more of these objects then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time, causing the worldwide extinction. As with the impact of a single asteroid, the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures, followed by a protracted cool period. [ 120 ]     Deccan Traps   Main article:  Deccan Traps   Before 2000, arguments that the  Deccan Traps   flood basalts  caused the  extinction  were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 mya and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two-thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in 1 million years about 65.5 mya, so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly a period of thousands of years, but still a longer period than what would be expected from a single impact event. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulphuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reducing photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the  greenhouse effect  when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere. [ 122 ]  Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of  volcanic gasses  during the formation of the  Deccan traps  ""contributed to an apparently massive  global warming . Some data point to an average rise in temperature of 8 C (14 F) in the last half million years before the  impact [at Chicxulub] ."" [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction,  Luis Alvarez  (who died in 1988) replied that  paleontologists  were being misled by  sparse data . While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in  sea level  and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions. [ 123 ]     Failure to adapt to changing conditions   Lloyd  et al.  (2008) noted that, in the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previously been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites   fossilized dung  indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Statistical analysis by Lloyd  et al.  concluded that, contrary to earlier studies, dinosaurs did not diversify very much in the Late Cretaceous. Lloyd  et al.  suggested that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Possible Paleocene survivors   Nonavian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the  K-T boundary . In 2002, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single  hadrosaur  leg bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico and described it as evidence of  Paleocene dinosaurs . The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early  Paleocene  epoch approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that  stratum  by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era. [ 124 ]  Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the  Hell Creek Formation  up to 1.3 meters (51 in) above (40,000 years later than) the K-T boundary. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China. [ 125 ]  Many scientists, however, dismiss the ""Paleocene dinosaurs"" as re-worked, i.e. washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments, [ 126 ] [ 127 ]  or find that, if correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction. [ 126 ]     History of discovery   Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese, whose modern word for dinosaur is  konglong  (, or ""terrible dragon""), considered them to be  dragon   bones  and documented them as such. For example,  Hua Yang Guo Zhi , a book written by Zhang Qu during the  Western Jin Dynasty , reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in  Sichuan  Province. [ 128 ]  Villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized ""dragon bones"" for use in traditional medicines, a practice that continues today. [ 129 ]  In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of  giants  and other creatures killed by the  Great Flood .   Scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in  England . Part of a bone, now known to have been the  femur  of a  Megalosaurus , [ 130 ]  was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near  Chipping Norton ,  Oxfordshire , England in 1676. The fragment was sent to  Robert Plot , Professor of Chemistry at the  University of Oxford  and first curator of the  Ashmolean Museum , who published a description in his  Natural History of Oxfordshire  in 1677. He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the  femur  of a large animal, but recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species. He therefore concluded it to be the thigh bone of a giant human similar to those mentioned in the  Bible . In 1699,  Edward Lhuyd , a friend of  Sir Isaac Newton , was responsible for the first published scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a  sauropod   tooth , "" Rutellum implicatum "" [ 131 ] [ 132 ] , that had been found in Caswell, near Whitney, Oxfordshire. [ 133 ]           William Buckland .       Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev  William Buckland , a professor of  geology  at  Oxford University , collected more fossilized bones of  Megalosaurus  and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a  scientific journal . [ 134 ] [ 130 ]  The second dinosaur genus to be identified,  Iguanodon , was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell - the wife of English geologist  Gideon Mantell . Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between  his fossils  and the bones of modern  iguanas . He published his findings in 1825. [ 135 ] [ 136 ]   The study of these ""great fossil lizards"" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist  Richard Owen  coined the term ""dinosaur"". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far,  Iguanodon ,  Megalosaurus  and  Hylaeosaurus , shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of  Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha , the husband of  Queen Victoria , Owen established the  Natural History Museum  in  South Kensington ,  London , to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.   In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in  marl  pits in the small town of  Haddonfield, New Jersey  (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named  Hadrosaurus  foulkii . It was an extremely important find;  Hadrosaurus  was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found and it was clearly a  bipedal  creature. ( The first  was in 1834, in Maidstone, Kent, England) This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the  United States .           Othniel Charles Marsh , 19th century photograph.               Edward Drinker Cope , 19th century photograph.       Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Othniel Charles Marsh , both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the  Bone Wars . The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an  Elasmosaurus  skeleton was flawed; Cope had inadvertently placed the  plesiosaur 's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the  US Geological Survey . Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods; for example, their diggers often used  dynamite  to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast; Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, for a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the  American Museum of Natural History  in  New York , while Marsh's is on display at the  Peabody Museum of Natural History  at  Yale University . [ 137 ]   Since 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils has extended to every continent, including  Antarctica . The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the  ankylosaurid   Antarctopelta oliveroi , was found on  Ross Island  in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod  Cryolophosaurus ellioti , was formally named and described in a scientific journal.   Current dinosaur ""hot spots"" include southern South America (especially  Argentina ) and  China . China in particular has produced many exceptional  feathered dinosaur  specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to  fossilization .     The ""dinosaur renaissance""   Main article:  Dinosaur renaissance   The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by  John Ostrom 's discovery of  Deinonychus , an active predator that may have been  warm-blooded , in marked contrast to the then-prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and  cold-blooded .  Vertebrate paleontology  has become a global  science . Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including  India , South America,  Madagascar ,  Antarctica , and most significantly in  China  (the amazingly well-preserved  feathered dinosaurs  in  China  have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of  cladistics , which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in  classifying  dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary  fossil record .     Cultural depictions   Main article:  Cultural depictions of dinosaurs          A  Megalosaurus  stalks  Crystal Palace Park  in  London .       By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word ""dinosaur"" into the common  vernacular  reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, ""dinosaur"" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, slow-moving, obsolete, or bound for extinction. [ 138 ]   Public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in  Victorian  England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, the famous  dinosaur sculptures  were unveiled in  London 's  Crystal Palace Park . The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and  museums  around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way. [ 139 ]  Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the  Bone Wars  of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions. [ 140 ]   The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in  literature ,  film  and other  media . Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in  Charles Dickens'   Bleak House , [ 141 ]  dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of  fictional  works.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's 1912 book  The Lost World , the iconic 1933  film   King Kong , 1954's  Godzilla  and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel  Jurassic Park  by  Michael Crichton  and its 1993  film adaptation  are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest  non-fictional  works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in  advertising ; numerous  companies  have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted or obsolete. [ 142 ]     Religious views   Main article:  Young Earth Creationism#Palaeontology and dinosaurs   Various religious groups have views about dinosaurs that differ from those held by the vast majority of scientists, usually due to conflicts with  creation stories  in their scriptures. However, most of the  scientific  community rejects these religiously-inspired interpretations of dinosaurs.

Dinosaurs first appeared approximately 230 million years ago (mya) during the  Triassic  and disappeared at the end of the  Cretaceous  period, approximately 65 mya, when a catastrophic  extinction event  ended their dominance on land. The Mesozoic is often called the ""Age of Dinosaurs"" after the dominant fauna of the era. Modern  birds  are generally considered to be the direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs.   The finding of  fossils  of the ""terrible lizards"" presented a conundrum for  young earth creationists , who maintain that the earth is thousands of years old rather than millions of years old. Initially, a different kind of religious/philosophical problem, related to  extinction , was presented to those who professed Divine Creation of all of natures creatures: If God is perfect, and He made a perfect creation, why would He allow any of His created organisms to become extinct? However, for most present-day religious adherents, the finding of fossils of dinosaurs from many millions of years ago is not problematic to the view of a Creator God, since it is recognized that all development passes through stages involving time, such as the  life cycle  of a  butterfly  (egg, larva, pupa, and adult) or the history of life on Earth ( Precambrian ,  Paleozoic ,  Mesozoic ,  Cenozoic , etc.) Rather, earlier stages provide a foundation for future stages. The relatively sudden demise of dinosaurs, after a long period of dominance, provided the foundation for events such as the rise of  mammals  and  birds .   Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the nineteenth century, mounted dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at  museums  around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular among children and adults alike. They have been featured in best-selling books and films such as  Jurassic Park , and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.   The term  dinosaur  is sometimes used informally to describe other prehistoric reptiles, such as the  pelycosaur   Dimetrodon , the winged  pterosaurs , and the aquatic  ichthyosaurs ,  plesiosaurs , and  mosasaurs , although technically none of these were dinosaurs.

Definition           Triceratops  skeleton at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City       The  taxon   Dinosauria  was formally named by the English  palaeontologist   Richard Owen  in 1842 as ""a distinct tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles"" (Owen 1842). The term is derived from the  Greek  words  ( deinos  meaning ""terrible"", ""fearsome,"" or ""formidable"") and ñ ( saura  meaning ""lizard"" or ""reptile""). Owen chose the name to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct animals (Farlow and Brett-Surman 1997), not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws. Owen was describing this group based on three large fossils found in England: Megalosaurus, Iguanodon, and Hylaeosaurus.   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals. According to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed (Wang and Dodson 2006, Fountain 2006). Some were  herbivorous , others  carnivorous . Some dinosaurs were bipeds (moving on two legs), some were quadrupeds (moving on four legs), and others, such as  Ammosaurus  and  Iguanodon , are considered to be able to walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial—that is, land-bound—rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.     Distinguishing features of dinosaurs   While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton.  Archosaurs  are a group of diapsid reptiles represented today by birds and crocodiles. This group also included the dinosaurs.  Diapsids  (""two arches"") are a group of tetrapod animals that appeared in the fossil record about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. Diapsids possess a pair of holes in their skulls behind the eyes, along with a second pair located higher on the skull.   Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these common archosaurian traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: an elongated crest on the humerus (upper arm bone) for deltopectoral muscles; a shelf on the back-rear of the ilium (main hip bone); a tibia (shin) with its lower edge expanded side to side and a flange pointing to the rear and outside; and an ascending projection on the astragalus (one of the ankle bones) which locks it to the tibia (Benton 2004a).   A variety of other skeletal features were shared by many dinosaurs. However, because they were either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. Such shared features include a diapsid skull bearing two pairs of holes in the temporal region, and holes in the snout and lower jawtwo characteristics shared by other archosaurs. Other characteristics include loss of the skull's postfrontal bone; a long neck incorporating an S-shaped curve (Holtz 2000); an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, coupled to asymmetrical hands; a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae; and an acetabulum, or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (Langer et al. 1999).           Edmontonia  was an ""armored dinosaur"" of the group Ankylosauria.       The open, or ""perforate,"" hip joint of dinosaurs had significant implications for dinosaur movement and behavior. Most notably, it allowed dinosaur hind limbs to be underslung, or situated directly beneath the animals' bodies; this, in turn, allowed dinosaurs to stand erect in a manner similar to modern  mammals , but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side (Benton 2004b). Vertical limb configuration also enabled dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that surpassed those of sprawling reptiles.   Taxonomic definition   Under phylogenetic  taxonomy  (classification centered on evolutionary relatedness), dinosaurs are defined as descendants of the most recent common ancestor of  Triceratops  and modern  birds . It has also been suggested that  Dinosauria  be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of  Megalosaurus  and  Iguanodon , because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria.   Dinosaurs are divided into Ornithischia ( bird-hipped ) and Saurischia ( lizard-hipped ), depending upon the pelvic girdle structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only (Benton 2004b). Ornithischia includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with  Triceratops  than with Saurischia, while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with  birds  than with Ornithischia.           Stegosaurus  skeleton, Field Museum, Chicago.       Birds are cited in the definition of Saurischia because there is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs (bipedal saurischian dinosaurs). Using the strict  cladistical  definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds  are  dinosaurs and dinosaurs, therefore, are not extinct. Modern  birds  are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, which are coelurosaurs, a kind of theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs (Padian 2004).   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean classification system, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use  cladistics , which classifies birds as dinosaurs, although some biologists do not.   For clarity, this article will use ""dinosaur"" as a synonym for ""non-avian dinosaur"", and ""bird"" as a synonym for ""avian dinosaur"" (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of  Archaeopteryx  and modern birds). The term ""non-avian dinosaur"" will be used for emphasis as needed.     Size          Comparative size of  Diplodocus ; human figures provide scale.       While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the sauropods (a suborder or infraorder of the saurischian, ""lizard-hipped,"" dinosaurs, including  Apatosaurus  and  Brachiosaurus ) were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric  mammals  such as the  Indricotherium  and the Columbian  mammoth  were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach or surpass them in sizemost notably the blue whale, which reaches up to 190,000 kg (209 tons) and 33.5 m (110 ft) in length.   Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the  Triassic , early  Jurassic , late Jurassic, and  Cretaceous periods  (Holtz, 1998). According to paleontologist Bill Erickson, estimates of median dinosaur weight range from 500 kg to 5 metric tons; a recent study of 63 dinosaur genera yielded an average weight greater than 850 kgcomparable to the weight of a grizzly  bear and a median weight of nearly 2 tons, or about as much as a  giraffe . This contrasts sharply with the size of modern mammals; on average, mammals weigh only 863 grams, or about as much as a large rodent. The smallest dinosaur was bigger than two-thirds of all current mammals; the majority of dinosaurs were bigger than all but 2% of living mammals (Erickson 2005).   Largest and smallest dinosaurs   Only a tiny percentage of animals ever  fossilize , and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the largest and smallest dinosaurs.          Comparative size of  Eoraptor .       The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is  Brachiosaurus brancai  (also known as  Giraffatitan ). Its remains were discovered in  Tanzania  between 190712. Bones from multiple similarly-sized individuals were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the Humboldt Museum of Berlin (Colbert 1968); this mount is 12 m (38 ft) tall, 22.5 m (74 ft) long, and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between 30,00060,000 kg (3366 short tons, with a short ton equal to 2,000 pounds). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 m (89 ft) long  Diplodocus , which was discovered in Wyoming in the  United States  and displayed in Pittsburgh's Carnegie Natural History Museum in 1907.   There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils. Most of the largest  herbivorous  specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive  Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed 80,000100,000 kg (88121 short tons); the longest, the 40 m (130 ft) long  Supersaurus ; and the tallest, the 18 m (60 ft)  Sauroposeidon , which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The longest of them all may have been  Amphicoelias fragillimus , known only from a now lost partial vertebral neural arch described in 1878. Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone, the animal may have been 58 m (190 ft) long and weighed over 120,000 kg (132 short tons) (Carpenter 2006), heavier than all known dinosaurs except possibly the poorly known  Bruhathkayosaurus , which could have weighed 175,000-220,000 kg (193-243 tons). The largest known  carnivorous  dinosaur was  Spinosaurus , reaching a length of 16-18 meters (53-60 ft), and weighing in at 9 tons (dal Sasso et al. 2006). Other large meat-eaters included  Giganotosaurus ,  Mapusaurus ,  Tyrannosaurus rex  and  Carcharodontosaurus .   Not including modern birds like the bee hummingbird, the smallest dinosaurs known were about the size of a  crow  or a  chicken . The theropods  Microraptor  and  Parvicursor  were both under 60 cm (2 ft) in length.     Behavior          A nesting ground of  Maiasaura  was discovered in 1978.       Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body  fossils  and their habitat, computer simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches. As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors common in  crocodiles  and  birds , dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.   The first perceived direct evidence of herding behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31  Iguanodon  dinosaurs, which were thought to have perished together in Bernissart,  Belgium , after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkhole and drowned (Yans et al. 2005). Despite the deposition of those skeletons being regarded now as more gradual (Van Acker 2001), other well supported mass death sites were subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that herd or pack behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-bills (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the  American Bison  or the African  Springbok . Sauropod tracks in England document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species (Day and Upchurch 2002). Others kept their young in the middle of the herd for defense, according to trackways at Davenport Ranch, Texas. Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for their young.   Paleontologist Jack Horner's 1978 discovery of a  Maiasaura  (""good mother dinosaur"") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care apparently continued long after birth among the ornithopods (Lessem and Glut 1993). There is also evidence that other  Cretaceous  period dinosaurs, like the  Patagonian  sauropod  Saltasaurus  (1997 discovery), had similar nesting behaviors, and that the animals congregated in huge nesting colonies like those of  penguins . The  Mongolian  maniraptoran  Oviraptor  was discovered in a  chicken -like brooding position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the  eggs  warm. Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among sauropods and ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern  Scotland  (BBC 2003). Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.          Artist's rendering of two  Centrosaurus , herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous fauna of North America.       The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the marginocephalians, theropods, and lambeosaurines, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territoriality. The nature of dinosaur communication also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent evidence suggests that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as resonance chambers used for a wide range of vocalizations.   From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the  Gobi Desert  in 1971, when paleontologists unearthed a  Velociraptor  attacking a  Protoceratops , illustrating interspecific predation.   Paleontologists have also speculated on cannibalistic behavior, based on evidence such as toothmarks (Mayell 2002, Rogers et al. 2003).   There have not been any few indications climbing species of dinosaurs, and no indication of a burrowing species. Since the later  mammalian  radiation in the  Cenozoic  produced many burrowing and climbing species, the lack of evidence for similar dinosaur species is somewhat surprising.   Because most dinosaur species seem to have relied on land-based locomotion, a good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, in particular, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by  muscles  and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have offered a new understanding of how fast dinosaurs could run (University of Bristol 2007, EGS 2007), whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping (Douglas and Young 1998), whether giant theropods had to slow down when rushing for food to avoid fatal injuries (Hecht 1998), and whether sauropods could float (Henderson 2003).     Evolution of dinosaurs   Dinosaurs appear to have diverged from their archosaur ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late  Triassic  period, roughly 20 million years after the  Permian-Triassic extinction event  wiped out an estimated 95% of all  life  on Earth.   Radiometric dating of  fossils  from the early dinosaur genus  Eoraptor  establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists believe  Eoraptor  resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs (Hayward 1997). If this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators (Sereno et al. 1993). The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as  Marasuchus  and  Lagerpeton  in  Argentinian  Middle Triassic strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.   The first few lines of primitive dinosaurs diversified rapidly through the rest of the Triassic period; dinosaur species quickly appeared with the the specialized features and range of sizes needed to exploit nearly every terrestrial  ecological niche . During the period of dinosaur predominance, which encompassed the ensuing  Jurassic  and  Cretaceous  periods, nearly every known land animal larger than 1 meter in length was a dinosaur.   The  Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event , which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the line that had already given rise to the first  birds . Other diapsid species related to the dinosaurs also survived the event.     Study of dinosaurs   Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of  fossil  and non-fossil records, including fossilized  bones , feces, trackways, gastroliths (stones in the stomach),  feathers , impressions of  skin , internal organs, and soft tissues (Dal Sasso and Signore 1998, Schwitzer et al. 2005). Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including physics,  chemistry ,  biology , and the earth sciences (of which  paleontology  is a sub-discipline).   Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including  Antarctica . Numerous fossils of the same dinosaur species have been found on completely different continents, corroborating the generally-accepted theory that all land masses were at one time connected in a super-continent called  Pangaea . Pangaea began to break apart during the  Triassic  period roughly 230 million years ago (Evans 1998).     History of discovery   Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese, whose own word for dinosaur is  konglong  (P, or ""terrible dragon""), considered them to be dragon  bones  and documented them as such. For example,  Hua Yang Guo Zhi , a book written by Zhang Qu during the Western Jin Dynasty, reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in Sichuan Province (Zhiming 1992). In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of giants and other creatures killed by the Great Flood.          William Buckland.       Megalosaurus  was the first dinosaur to be formally described, in 1677, when part of a bone was recovered from a  limestone  quarry at Cornwell near Oxford, England. This bone fragment was identified correctly as the lower extremity of the femur of an animal larger than anything living in modern times. The second dinosaur species to be identified,  Iguanodon , was discovered in 1822 by the English geologist Gideon Mantell, who recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern  iguanas . Two years later, the Rev. William Buckland, a professor of  geology  at Oxford University, unearthed more fossilized bones of  Megalosaurus  and became the first person to describe dinosaurs in a scientific journal.   The study of these ""great fossil lizards"" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist  Richard Owen  coined the term ""dinosaur."" He recognized that the remains that had been found so far,  Iguanodon ,  Megalosaurus  and  Hylaeosaurus , shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the husband of Queen Victoria, Owen established the Natural History Museum in South Kensington,  London , to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.   In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in marl pits in the small town of Haddonfield, New Jersey (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named  Hadrosaurus foulkii , after the town and the discoverer, William Parker Foulke. It was an extremely important find;  Hadrosaurus  was the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton found and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the  United States .           Othniel Charles Marsh , nineteenth-century photograph.               Edward Drinker Cope , nineteenth-century photograph.       Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry in the United States between  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Othniel Charles Marsh , both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the  Bone Wars . The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an  Elasmosaurus  skeleton was flawed; Cope had inadvertently placed the  plesiosaur 's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the U.S. Geological Survey (and he helped to end Cope's funding). Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods; for example, their diggers often used  dynamite  to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). The rivalry was fierce: in addition to efforts to hurt each other's reputation, there were allegations of stealing fossils, stealing workers, treaty violations, and even that Marsh dynamited a quarry rather than let Cope get the fossils.   Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast; Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, for a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the  American Museum of Natural History  in New York, while Marsh's is on display at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University (Williams 1997).   Since 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils has extended to every continent, including  Antarctica . The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the ankylosaur  Antarctopelta oliveroi , was found on Ross Island in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod  Cryolophosaurus ellioti , was formally named and described in a scientific journal.   Current dinosaur ""hot spots"" include southern South America (especially  Argentina ) and China. China in particular has produced many exceptional feathered dinosaur specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to  fossilization . The well-preserved feathered dinosaurs in China have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern  birds ).     The current ""dinosaur renaissance""          Model of a  Deinonychus  skull.       The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by John Ostrom's discovery of  Deinonychus , an active, vicious predator that may have been  warm-blooded , and was a marked contrast to the then-prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and  cold-blooded . Vertebrate  paleontology , arguably the primary scientific discipline involved in dinosaur research, has become a global science. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including  India ,  South America ,  Madagascar , and most significantly in China.   The widespread application of  cladistics , which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in  classifying  dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record.     Classification   Dinosaurs (including  birds ) are archosaurs, like modern  crocodilians . Archosaurs' diapsid skulls have two holes located where the jaw muscles attach, called temporal fenestrae. Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called synapsids; and  turtles , with no temporal fenestra, are anapsids. Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side.   Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a  superorder  or an unranked clade. They are divided into two  orders , the  Saurischia  and the  Ornithischia , on the basis of their hip structure. Saurischians ('lizard-hipped', from the  Greek   sauros  ( ñ ) meaning 'lizard' and  ischion  ( ǹ ) meaning 'hip joint') are dinosaurs that originally retained the hip structure of their ancestors. They include all the theropods (bipedal  carnivores ) and sauropods (long-necked  herbivores ). Ornithischians ('bird-hipped', from the  Greek   ornitheos  (  ) meaning 'of a bird' and  ischion  ( ǹ ) meaning 'hip joint') is the other dinosaurian order, most of which were quadrupedal herbivores.   Note that the terms ""lizard hip"" and ""bird-hip"" are misnomers and misleadingbirds evolved from dinosaurs with ""lizard hips.""

Did You Know?   From 40 to 25 million years ago, penguins were the dominant warm-blooded predators of fish, krill,  and squid. There were at least 40 penguin species back then, today there are 17 species of penguin.  The Adelie Penguin is the typical looking penguin, purely black and white, with white eye rings.  The Emperor and King penguins have yellow-orange neck markings.                                                                                   Did You Know?   Penguins are flightless birds.  Their wings have been modified to  flippers for ocean swimming.  Penguins are gregarious, which  means they like to live  in community flocks or groups.  Penguin communities are called  colonies.          Penguins eat fish and          crustaceans. Nine species of          penguins live in the cool waters          south of New Zealand.                 Did You Know?           Seven of the 17         penguin species live          mainly in the sub-Antarctic regions,  where it is extremely cold.  There are several million different  penguins inhabiting the coastline  of Antarctica. Antarctica has virtually  no vegetation.  Many dinosaur fossils  have recently been located in  Antarctica, proving that Antarctica          was once warm and had vegetation.

Indeed these graceful, yet comical;                  hardy yet elegant creatures are considered by many to be the signature                  species of the polar south. That is why we decided to create a                  separate section devoted to the many penguin species and their                  fascinating characteristics.                  Early                  Antarctic explorers actually thought penguins were fish and classified                  them accordingly. In fact, as birds, they are superbly designed                  for their job, flying underwater with great skill. Their compact                  bodies have a breastbone that makes an excellent keel and they                  have massive paddle muscles to propel them at speeds up to 25                  miles per hour. Their heads retract to create a perfect hydrodynamic                  shape. When traveling quickly, penguins will leap clear of the                  water every few feet -- an action called 'porpoising.' This enables                  them to breathe, and decreases their chances of being taken by                  a predator. Antarctic penguins have also developed the ability                  to leap out of the water to a substantial height on land, enabling                  them to quickly reach the safety of raised ice edges or rock ledges.                  Penguin legs are set far down on their bodies, so they walk with                  a very erect posture. Ashore they are often awkward, waddling                  and hopping over rocks; on snow they sometimes push themselves                  along on their stomachs.                  Of                  the 17 species of penguins, only four breed on the Antarctic continent                  itself: the  Adelie ,                  the  Emperor , the  Chinstrap                   and the  Gentoo  penguins.                  Most other species are found within the subantarctic regions which                  includes many coastal islands. Penguins are also found as far                  north as the  Galapagos                   Islands, straddling the Equator.                  Penguins                  are true flightless birds. Some species spend as much as 75% of                  their lives at sea, yet they all breed on land or sea-ice attached                  to land. To withstand the harsh conditions of the Antarctic, their                  bodies are insulated by a thick layer of blubber and a dense network                  of waterproof plumage. Penguins' bones are solid and heavy, which                  help them to remain submerged and reduce the energy needed for                  pursuit diving. Some species can reach depths of 1000 feet or                  more and stay submerged for up to 25 minutes, though most prefer                  shorter, shallower dives.                 Penguins                  are now enjoying a population boom. Their increasing numbers can                  be partly attributed to the over-fishing of baleen  whales                   in the past which has resulted in a super-abundance of krill,                  a key species in the Antarctic ecosystem. In addition to krill,                  penguins feed heavily on fish, squid, and other small crustaceans.                                   Penguins                  generally breed in large, dense colonies called 'rookeries', some                  with 180,000 or more birds. The sights, smells, and noise of one                  of these huge colonies are unforgettable. Most penguins build                  nests of stone and there they incubate one or two eggs. Adult                  pairs take turns incubating their eggs and feeding the chicks                  once they have hatched. Communication at these crowded rookeries                  can be very important not only in locating mates or offspring,                  but also in courting rituals or signalling danger. In addition                  to vocal signals, penguins also communicate by head and flipper                  waving, bowing, gesturing and preening.                  Natural                  enemies of the penguin include  seals ,                   Killer whales ,                  and, in the case of young chicks and eggs, several species of                   seabirds . Healthy adult penguins                  have no predators on land, so they have no natural fear of humans.                  While they don't like to be approached directly, these naturally                  curious birds will sometimes come quite close to a quiet observer                  to get a better look.

Chinstrap Penguin              The  Chinstrap Penguin  (Pygoscelis antarcticus) is a species of penguin which is found in the South Sandwich Islands, Antarctica, the South Orkneys, South Shetland, South Georgia, Bouvet Island, Balleny and Peter Island. Their name derives from the narrow black band under their heads which makes it appear as if they are wearing black helmets, making them one of the most easily identified types of penguin. Other names for them are ""Ringed Penguins"", ""Bearded Penguins"", and ""Stonecracker Penguins"" due to their harsh call. They grow to 68cm (27 in) and there are approximately 7,500,000 breeding pairs. The average adult weight of a Chinstrap Penguin is 4.5 kg (10 lbs) Weight of Chinstrap Penguin. Weight can range from 3 to 6 kg (6.6-13.2 lbs), with males being slightly larger and weigh varying based on where the penguin is in the breeding cycle.http://www.mhcbe.ab.ca/St_Francis/gr1/Webquests/chinstrap_penguin%20student.htmhttp://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pygoscelis_antarcticus.html Their diet consists of krill (a shrimp-like sea creature), shrimp, and fish.      read the rest of the Wikipedia article                                 African Penguin              The  African Penguin  (Spheniscus demersus), also known as the  Black-footed Penguin  or  Jackass Penguin  is found on the south-western coast of Africa, living in colonies on 24 islands between Namibia and Algoa Bay, near Port Elizabeth, South Africa, with the largest colony on Dyer Island, near Kleinbaai. Two colonies were established by penguins in the 1980s on the mainland near Cape Town at Boulders Beach near Simon's Town and Stony Point in Betty's Bay. Mainland colonies probably only became possible in recent times due to the reduction of predator numbers, although the Betty's Bay colony has been attacked by leopards. The only other mainland colony is in Namibia, but it is not known when this was established. Boulders Beach is a tourist attraction, for the beach, swimming and the penguins. The penguins will allow people to approach them as close as a meter (three ft).  The closest relatives of the African Penguins are the Humboldt Penguin and Magellanic Penguins found in southern South America and the Galpagos Penguin found in the Pacific Ocean near the equator.      read the rest of the Wikipedia article                                 Emperor Penguin              The  Emperor Penguin  (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica. The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching in height and weighing anywhere from 22?37kg (48-82lb). The dorsal parts are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine lifestyle. Fish form the bulk of its diet, which can include crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid. In hunting, the species can remain submerged up to 18minutes, diving to a depth of . It has several adaptations to facilitate this, including an unusually structured haemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma, and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions.  The Emperor Penguin is perhaps best known for the sequence of journeys adults make each year in order to mate and to feed their offspring. The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, it treks 50-120km (31-75mi) over the ice to breeding colonies which may include thousands of individuals. The female lays a single egg, which is incubated by the male while the female returns to the sea to forage; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick in the colony. The lifespan is typically 20years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live to 50years of age.      read the rest of the Wikipedia article                                 Yellow-eyed Penguin              The  Yellow-eyed Penguin  (Megadyptes antipodes) or  HoiHo  is a penguin native to New Zealand. Previously thought closely related to the Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor), molecular research has shown it more closely related to penguins of the genus Eudyptes. Like most other penguins, it is mainly piscivorous. The species breeds around the South Island of New Zealand, as well as Stewart, Auckland and Campbell Islands. Colonies on the Otago Peninsula are a popular tourist venue, where visitors may closely observe penguins from hides, trenches or tunnels.      read the rest of the Wikipedia article                                 Galpagos Penguin              The  Galpagos Penguin  (Spheniscus mendiculus) is a penguin endemic to the Galpagos Islands. It is the only penguin to live on the equator and can survive due to the cool temperatures resulting from the Humboldt Current and cool waters from great depths brought up by the Cromwell Current. Its nearest relatives are the African Penguin, the Magellanic Penguin and the Humboldt Penguin. The Galpagos Penguin occurs primarily on Fernandina Island and the west coast of Isabela Island, but small populations are scattered on other islands in the Galpagos archipelago.      read the rest of the Wikipedia article                                 Penguins Chart Animals Poster Print                                                   Penguins Chart Animals Poster Print, 24x36                     Amazon Price:  $21.99 (as of 01/11/2009)                                                                                Happy Feet is an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble                                                  Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)                     Amazon Price:  $13.49 (as of 01/11/2009)                                     In the great nation of Emperor Penguins, deep in Antarctica, you're nobody unless you can sing - which is unfortunate for Mumble (ELIJAH WOOD), who is the worst singer in the world.

The 10,000 living species of  birds  have been  classified  as dinosaurs.   The term ""dinosaur"" was coined in 1842 by  Sir Richard Owen  and derives from  Greek     ( deinos ) ""terrible, powerful, wondrous"" +    ( sauros ) ""lizard"". It is sometimes used informally to describe other  prehistoric reptiles , such as the  pelycosaur   Dimetrodon , the winged  pterosaurs , and the aquatic  ichthyosaurs ,  plesiosaurs  and  mosasaurs , although none of these animals were dinosaurs. Through the first half of the 20th century, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been slow, unintelligent  cold-blooded  animals. Most  research conducted since the 1970s , however, has supported the view that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. The resulting transformation in the scientific understanding of dinosaurs has gradually filtered into popular consciousness.   The 1861 discovery of the primitive bird  Archaeopteryx  first suggested a close relationship between dinosaurs and birds. Aside from the presence of fossilized feather impressions,  Archaeopteryx  was very similar to the contemporary small predatory dinosaur  Compsognathus . Research has since identified  theropod  dinosaurs as the most likely direct ancestors of  birds ; most paleontologists today regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs, and some suggest that dinosaurs and birds should be grouped into one biological class. [ 1 ]  Aside from birds,  crocodilians  are the only other close relatives of dinosaurs to have survived until the present day. Like dinosaurs and birds, crocodilians are members of  Archosauria , a group of  reptiles  that first appeared in the very late  Permian  and came to predominate in the mid-Triassic.   Since the first dinosaur  fossils  were recognized in the early  nineteenth century , mounted dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular. They have been featured in best-selling books and films (notably  Jurassic Park ), and new discoveries are regularly covered by the  media .

[ 2 ]  The term is derived from the  Greek  words  ( deinos  meaning ""terrible"", ""powerful"", or ""wondrous"") and  ( saura  meaning ""lizard"" or ""reptile""). [ 3 ]  Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty. [ 4 ]  In colloquial English ""dinosaur"" is sometimes used to describe an obsolete or unsuccessful thing or person, [ 5 ]  despite the dinosaurs' 160 million year reign and the global abundance and diversity of their descendants, the birds.     Modern definition           Triceratops   skeleton  at the  American Museum of Natural History  in New York City.       Under  phylogenetic taxonomy , dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of "" Triceratops ,  Neornithes  [modern birds], their  most recent common ancestor , and all descendants."" [ 6 ]  It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the most recent common ancestor of  Megalosaurus  and  Iguanodon , because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria. [ 7 ]  Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs, including  theropods  (mostly  bipedal   carnivores ),  sauropodomorphs  (mostly large  herbivorous   quadrupeds  with long necks and tails),  ankylosaurians  (armored herbivorous quadrupeds),  stegosaurians  (plated herbivorous quadrupeds),  ceratopsians  (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), and  ornithopods  (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including ""duck-bills""). These definitions are written to correspond with scientific conceptions of dinosaurs that predate the modern use of phylogenetics. The continuity of meaning is intended to prevent confusion about what the term ""dinosaur"" means.   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict  cladistical  definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor must be included in a group for that group to be natural, birds  are  dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup  Maniraptora , which are  coelurosaurs , which are theropods, which are  saurischians , which are dinosaurs. [ 8 ]   From the point of view of cladistics, birds are dinosaurs, but in ordinary speech the word ""dinosaur"" does not include birds. Additionally, referring to dinosaurs that are not birds as ""non-avian dinosaurs"" is cumbersome. For clarity, this article will use ""dinosaur"" as a synonym for ""non-avian dinosaur"". The term ""non-avian dinosaur"" will be used for emphasis as needed. It is also technically correct to refer to dinosaurs as a distinct group under the older  Linnaean classification  system, which accepts  paraphyletic  taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor.     General description           Stegosaurus  skeleton,  Field Museum ,  Chicago .       Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs (aside from birds) can be generally described as terrestrial  archosaurian   reptiles  with  limbs held erect beneath the body , that existed from the  Late Triassic  (first appearing in the  Carnian   faunal stage ) to the  Late Cretaceous  (going extinct at the end of the  Maastrichtian ). [ 9 ]  Many prehistoric animals are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and  Dimetrodon , but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs. Marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs were neither terrestrial nor archosaurs; pterosaurs were archosaurs but not terrestrial; and  Dimetrodon  was a  Permian  animal more closely related to mammals. [ 10 ]  Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the  Jurassic  and Cretaceous. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded the size of a cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey. [ 11 ]  One notable exception is  Repenomamus giganticus , a  triconodont  weighing between 12 kilograms (26 lb) and 14 kilograms (31 lb) that is known to have eaten small dinosaurs like young  Psittacosaurus . [ 12 ]   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1,850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. [ 13 ]  An earlier study predicted that about 3,400 dinosaur genera existed, including many which would not have been preserved in the fossil record. [ 14 ]  As of September 17, 2008, 1,047 different species of dinosaurs have been named. [ 15 ]  Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds, and others, such as  Ammosaurus  and  Iguanodon , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Many had  bony armor , or cranial modifications like horns and crests. Although known for large size, many dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller. Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including  Antarctica . [ 16 ]  No dinosaurs are known to have lived in marine or aerial habitats, although it is possible some feathered theropods were flyers.     Distinguishing features   While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral  archosaurian  skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common features across a taxonomic group are called  synapomorphies .   Dinosaur synapomorphies include an elongated crest on the  humerus , or upper arm bone, to accommodate the attachment of  deltopectoral  muscles; a shelf at the rear of the  ilium , or main hip bone; a  tibia , or shin bone, featuring a broad lower edge and a flange pointing out and to the rear; and an ascending projection on the  astragalus , one of the ankle bones, which secures it to the tibia. [ 17 ]           Edmontonia  was an ""armored dinosaur"" of the group  Ankylosauria .       A variety of other skeletal features were shared by many dinosaurs. However, because they were either common to other groups of  archosaurs  or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as  diapsid  reptiles, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of  temporal fenestrae  (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the  snout  and lower jaw. [ 18 ]  Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated  scapula , or shoulder blade; a  sacrum  composed of three or more fused  vertebrae  (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in  Herrerasaurus ); [ 17 ]  and an  acetabulum , or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in  Saturnalia , for example). [ 19 ]  Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the Late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature. [ 20 ]          Hip joints and hindlimb postures.       Dinosaurs stood erect in a manner similar to  most modern mammals , but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side. [ 21 ]  Their posture was due to the development of a laterally-facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly-facing distinct head on the femur. [ 22 ]  Their erect posture enabled dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that  surpassed those of ""sprawling"" reptiles . [ 23 ]  Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs. [ 24 ]  Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including  rauisuchians , also had erect limbs but achieved this by a ""pillar erect"" configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the  upper pelvic bone  was rotated to form an overhanging shelf. [ 24 ]     Natural history     Origins and early evolution   Main article:  Evolution of dinosaurs           Eoraptor , an early dinosaur genus.       For a long time many scientists thought dinosaurs were  polyphyletic  with multiple groups of unrelated ""dinosaurs"" evolving due to similar pressures, [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  but dinosaurs are now known to have formed a single group. [ 28 ] [ 17 ]   Dinosaurs diverged from their  archosaur  ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late  Triassic  period, roughly 20 million years after the  Permian-Triassic extinction event  wiped out an estimated 95% of all  life on Earth . [ 29 ] [ 30 ]   Radiometric dating  of the  rock formation  that contained fossils from the early dinosaur  genus   Eoraptor  establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists believe  Eoraptor  resembles the  common ancestor  of all dinosaurs; [ 31 ]  if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal  predators . [ 32 ]  The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like  ornithodirans  such as  Marasuchus  and  Lagerpeton  in  Argentinian   Middle Triassic  strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.   When dinosaurs appeared, terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of basal archosaurs and  therapsids , such as  aetosaurs ,  cynodonts ,  dicynodonts ,  ornithosuchids ,  rauisuchias , and  rhynchosaurs . Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, in one of two events. First, at about the boundary between the  Carnian  and  Norian   faunal stages  (about 215 million years ago), dicynodonts and a variety of basal  archosauromorphs , including the  prolacertiforms  and rhynchosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the  Triassic-Jurassic extinction event  (about 200 million years ago), that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids,  phytosaurs , and rauisuchians. These losses left behind a land fauna of  crocodylomorphs , dinosaurs,  mammals ,  pterosaurians , and  turtles . [ 17 ]   The first few lines of primitive dinosaurs  diversified  through the  Carnian  and  Norian   stages  of the Triassic, most likely by occupying the niches of groups that became extinct. Traditionally, dinosaurs were thought to have  replaced  the variety of other Triassic land animals by proving superior through a long period of competition. This now appears unlikely, for several reasons. Dinosaurs do not show a pattern of steadily increasing in diversity and numbers, as would be predicted if they were competitively replacing other groups; instead, they were very rare through the Carnian, making up only 1-2% of individuals present in  faunas . In the Norian, however, after the extinction of several other groups, they became significant components of faunas, representing 50-90% of individuals. Also, what had been viewed as a key adaptation of dinosaurs, their erect stance, is now known to have present in several contemporaneous groups that were not as successful (aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, rauisuchians, and some groups of crocodylomorphs). Finally, the Late Triassic itself was a time of great upheaval in life, with shifts in plant life, marine life, and climate. [ 17 ]   Crurotarsans , today represented only by crocodilians but in the Late Triassic also encompassing such now-extinct groups as aetosaurs, phytosaurs, ornithosuchians, and rauisuchians, were actually more diverse in the Late Triassic than dinosaurs, indicating that the survival of dinosaurs had more to do with luck than superiority. [ 33 ]     Low diversification in the Cretaceous   Statistical analyses based on raw data suggest that dinosaurs diversified, i.e. the number of species increased, in the Late  Cretaceous . However in July 2008 Graeme T. Lloyd  et al.  argued that this apparent diversification was an illusion caused by  sampling bias , because Late Cretaceous rocks have been very heavily studied. Instead, they wrote, dinosaurs underwent only two significant diversifications in the Late Cretaceous, the initial  radiations  of the  euhadrosaurs  and  ceratopsians . In the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previous been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites  (fossilized dung) indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Meanwhile  herbivorous  insects and  mammals  diversified rapidly to take advantage of the new type of plant food, while lizards, snakes,  crocodilians  and  birds  also diversified at the same time. Lloyd  et al.  suggest that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Classification   Main article:  Dinosaur classification   Dinosaurs (including birds) are  archosaurs , like modern  crocodilians . Archosaurs'  diapsid  skulls have two holes, called  temporal fenestrae , located where the jaw muscles attach, and an additional  antorbital fenestra  in front of the eyes. Most reptiles (including birds) are diapsids; mammals, with only one temporal fenestra, are called  synapsids ; and  turtles , with no temporal fenestra, are  anapsids . Anatomically, dinosaurs share many other archosaur characteristics, including teeth that grow from sockets rather than as direct extensions of the jawbones. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodylians sprawl out to either side.   Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a  superorder  or an unranked  clade . They are divided into two  orders ,  Saurischia  and  Ornithischia , depending upon  pelvic  structure. Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with  birds  than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all  taxa  sharing a more recent common ancestor with  Triceratops  than with Saurischia. Saurischians ('lizard-hipped', from the  Greek   sauros  (  ) meaning 'lizard' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') retained the hip structure of their ancestors, with a  pubis  bone directed  cranially , or forward. [ 22 ]  This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups ( Herrerasaurus , [ 35 ]   therizinosauroids , [ 36 ]   dromaeosaurids , [ 37 ]  and  birds [ 8 ] ). Saurischia includes the  theropods  (bipedal and mostly carnivores, except for birds) and  sauropodomorphs  (long-necked quadrupedal  herbivores ).   By contrast, ornithischians ('bird-hipped', from the  Greek   ornitheios  (  ) meaning 'of a bird' and  ischion  (  ) meaning 'hip joint') had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird's pelvis: the  pubis  bone was oriented  caudally  (rear-pointing). Unlike birds, the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward-pointing process. Ornithischia includes a variety of herbivores. ( NB:  the terms ""lizard hip"" and ""bird-hip"" are misnomers  birds evolved from dinosaurs with ""lizard hips"".)

In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass  Pangaea , there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of  coelophysoid   carnivores  and  prosauropod   herbivores . [ 38 ]   Gymnosperm  plants (particularly  conifers ), a potential food source, radiated in the Late Triassic. Prosauropods did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. [ 39 ]  The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of  ceratosaurians ,  spinosauroids , and  carnosaurians , and herbivores consisting of  stegosaurian  ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the  Morrison Formation  of North America and  Tendaguru Beds  of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized  sinraptorid  theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like  Mamenchisaurus . [ 38 ]   Ankylosaurians  and  ornithopods  were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and  pteridophytes  were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential  cheek -like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. [ 39 ]  Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians . [ 8 ]          An Illustration of 18 species of basal ceratopsia to scale.       By the Early Cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians,  iguanodontians , and  brachiosaurids  through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large  spinosaurid  and  carcharodontosaurid  theropods, and  rebbachisaurid  and  titanosaurian  sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia,  maniraptoran   coelurosaurians  like  dromaeosaurids ,  troodontids , and  oviraptorosaurians  became the common theropods, and  ankylosaurids  and early  ceratopsians  like  Psittacosaurus  became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians,  hypsilophodonts , and iguanodontians. [ 38 ]  The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early Late Cretaceous. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of  flowering plants . At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries, taken to its extreme in  hadrosaurids . [ 39 ]  Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid  Nigersaurus . [ 40 ]   There were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were  tyrannosaurids  and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and  pachycephalosaurians . In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting  Gondwana ,  abelisaurids  were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids,  rhabdodontid  iguanodontians,  nodosaurid  ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent. [ 38 ]  Flowering plants were greatly radiating, [ 39 ]  with the first grasses appearing by the end of the Cretaceous. [ 41 ]  Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia. Theropods were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores, with  therizinosaurians  and  ornithomimosaurians  becoming common. [ 39 ]   The  CretaceousTertiary extinction event , which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the birds. Some other  diapsid  groups, such as crocodylians,  lizards ,  snakes ,  sphenodontians , and  choristoderans , also survived the event. [ 42 ]     Paleobiology   Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil records, including  fossilized   bones ,  feces ,  trackways ,  gastroliths ,  feathers , impressions of skin,  internal organs  and  soft tissues . [ 43 ] [ 44 ]  Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including  physics  (especially  biomechanics ),  chemistry ,  biology , and the  earth sciences  (of which  paleontology  is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.     Size   Main article:  Dinosaur size          Scale diagram comparing the largest known dinosaurs in four  suborders  and a human.       While the evidence is incomplete, it is clear that, as a group, dinosaurs were large. Even by dinosaur standards, the  sauropods  were gigantic. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an  order of magnitude  more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric  mammals  such as the  Indricotherium  and the Columbian  mammoth  were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach or surpass them in size  most notably the  blue whale , which reaches up to 173,000 kilograms (381,000 lb) and over 30 meters (100 ft) in length. [ 45 ]  There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but it may be that the most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in  rock formations  interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments. [ 46 ]   Most dinosaurs, however, were much smaller than the giant sauropods. Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. [ 31 ]  Theropod dinosaurs, when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on  order of magnitude , most often fall into the 100 to 1,000 kilogram (220 to 2,200 lb) category, whereas  recent  predatory  carnivorans  peak in the 10 to 100 kilogram (22 to 220 lb) category. [ 47 ]  The  mode  of dinosaur body masses is between one and ten metric tonnes. [ 48 ]  This contrasts sharply with the size of  Cenozoic  mammals, estimated by the  National Museum of Natural History  as about 2 to 5 kilograms (5 to 10 lb). [ 49 ]     Largest and smallest   Only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. As a result, scientists will probably never be certain of the  largest and smallest dinosaurs .          Comparative size of  Brachiosaurus .       The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is  Brachiosaurus brancai  (also known as  Giraffatitan ). Its remains were discovered in  Tanzania  between 190712. Bones from multiple similarly-sized individuals were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the  Humboldt Museum  of  Berlin ; [ 50 ]  this mount is 12 meters (39 ft) tall and 22.5 meters (74 ft) long, and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between 30,000 and 60,000 kilograms (70,000 and 130,000 lb). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 m (89 ft) long  Diplodocus , which was discovered in  Wyoming  in the  United States  and displayed in  Pittsburgh's   Carnegie Natural History Museum  in 1907.          Comparative size of  Eoraptor .       There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils. Most of the largest  herbivorous  specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive  Argentinosaurus , which may have weighed 80,000 to 100,000 kilograms (90 to 110 short tons); some of the longest, the 33.5 meters (110 ft) long  Diplodocus hallorum [ 46 ]  (formerly  Seismosaurus ) and the 33 meters (110 ft) long  Supersaurus ; [ 51 ]  and the tallest, the 18 meters (59 ft)  Sauroposeidon , which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The longest of them all may have been  Amphicoelias fragillimus , known only from a now lost partial vertebral  neural arch  described in 1878. Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone, the animal may have been 58 meters (190 ft) long and weighed over 120,000 kilograms (260,000 lb), [ 46 ]  heavier than all known dinosaurs except possibly the poorly known  Bruhathkayosaurus , which could have weighed 175,000 to 220,000 kilograms (400,000 to 500,000 lb). The largest known  carnivorous  dinosaur was  Spinosaurus , reaching a length of 16 to 18 meters (50 to 60 ft), and weighing in at 8,150 kilograms (18,000 lb). [ 52 ]  Other large meat-eaters included  Giganotosaurus ,  Mapusaurus ,  Tyrannosaurus rex  and  Carcharodontosaurus .   Not including modern birds, the smallest dinosaurs known were about the size of a  pigeon . [ 53 ]  The theropods  Anchiornis  and  Epidexipteryx  both had a total skeletal length of under 35 centimeters (1.1 ft). [ 54 ] [ 53 ]   Anchiornis  is currently the smallest dinosaur described from an adult specimen, with an estimated weight of 110 grams. [ 54 ]  The smallest herbivorous dinosaurs included  Microceratus  and  Wannanosaurus , at about 60 cm long (2 ft) each. [ 55 ] [ 56 ]     Behavior          A nesting ground of  Maiasaura  was discovered in 1978.       Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their  habitat ,  computer simulations  of their  biomechanics , and comparisons with modern animals in similar  ecological niches . As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.   The first potential evidence of  herding  behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31  Iguanodon  dinosaurs which were then thought to have perished together in  Bernissart ,  Belgium , after they fell into a deep, flooded  sinkhole  and drowned. [ 57 ]  Other mass death sites have been subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that  duck-bills  (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the  American Bison  or the African  Springbok . Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in  Oxfordshire , England, [ 58 ]  although there is not evidence for specific herd structures. [ 59 ]  Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for  migratory  purposes, or to provide protection for their young. There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in  Inner Mongolia  that has yielded the remains of over twenty  Sinornithomimus , from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud. [ 60 ]  The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as  pack hunters  working together to bring down large prey. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  However, this lifestyle is uncommon among the modern relatives of dinosaurs ( crocodiles  and other reptiles, and  birds  -  Harris's Hawk  is a well-documented exception), and the  taphonomic  evidence suggesting pack hunting in such theropods as  Deinonychus  and  Allosaurus  can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern  diapsid  predators. [ 63 ]          Fossilized egg of the  oviraptorid   Citipati ,  American Museum of Natural History .       Jack Horner's  1978 discovery of a  Maiasaura  (""good mother dinosaur"")  nesting  ground in  Montana  demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the  ornithopods . [ 64 ]  There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like  Patagonian   titanosaurian  sauropods (1997 discovery), also nested in large groups. [ 65 ]  The  Mongolian   oviraptorid   Citipati  was discovered in a  chicken -like  brooding  position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the  eggs  warm. [ 66 ]  Parental care is also implied by other finds. For example, the fossilized remains of a grouping of  Psittacosaurus  has been found, consisting of one adult and 34 juveniles; in this case, the large number of juveniles may be due to communal nesting. [ 67 ]  Additionally, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the  prosauropod   Massospondylus ) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur. [ 68 ]  Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the  Isle of Skye  in northwestern  Scotland . [ 69 ]  Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.          Artist's rendering of two  Centrosaurus , herbivorous  ceratopsid  dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous fauna of North America.       The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the  marginocephalians ,  theropods  and  lambeosaurines , may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and  territorialism . Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations. [ 70 ]  The nature of dinosaur  communication  also remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recent studies suggest that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as  resonance chambers  used for a wide range of  vocalizations . [ 71 ] [ 72 ]   From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the  Gobi Desert  in 1971. It included a  Velociraptor  attacking a  Protoceratops , [ 73 ]  providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. [ 74 ]  Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially-healed tail of an  Edmontosaurus , a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. [ 74 ]   Cannibalism  amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod  Majungasaurus . [ 75 ]   Based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as  Oryctodromeus , some herbivorous species seem to have led a partially  fossorial  (burrowing) lifestyle, [ 76 ]  and some bird-like species may have been  arboreal  (tree-climbing), most notably primitive  dromaeosaurids  such as  Microraptor [ 77 ]  and the enigmatic  scansoriopterygids . [ 78 ]  However, most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of  biomechanics , in particular, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, [ 79 ]  whether  diplodocids  could create  sonic booms  via  whip -like tail snapping, [ 80 ]  and whether sauropods could float. [ 81 ]     Physiology   Main article:  Physiology of dinosaurs           Tyrannosaurus rex  skull and upper vertebral column, Palais de la Dcouverte, Paris.       A vigorous debate on the subject of temperature regulation in dinosaurs has been ongoing since the 1960s. Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur  endotherm  has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation.   After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were  ectothermic  creatures: ""terrible  lizards "" as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness implied that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, comparable to modern reptiles, which need external sources of heat in order to regulate their body temperature. Dinosaur ectothermy remained a prevalent view until  Robert T. ""Bob"" Bakker , an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968.   Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (perhaps aided by the animals' bulk). Evidence of  endotherm  in dinosaurs includes the discovery of  polar dinosaurs in Australia  and  Antarctica  (where they would have experienced a cold, dark six-month winter), the discovery of dinosaurs whose feathers may have provided regulatory insulation, and analysis of blood-vessel structures that are typical of endotherms within dinosaur bone. Skeletal structures suggest that theropods and other dinosaurs had active lifestyles better suited to an endothermic cardiovascular system, while sauropods exhibit fewer endothermic characteristics. It is certainly possible that some dinosaurs were endothermic while others were not. Scientific debate over the specifics continues. [ 82 ]           Eubrontes , a dinosaur footprint in the Lower  Jurassic  Moenave Formation at the St. George Dinosaur Discovery Site at Johnson Farm, southwestern Utah.       Complicating the debate is the fact that warm-bloodedness can emerge based on more than one mechanism. Most discussions of dinosaur endothermy tend to compare them to average birds or mammals, which expend energy to elevate body temperature above that of the environment. Small birds and mammals also possess  insulation , such as  fat ,  fur , or  feathers , which slows down heat loss. However, large mammals, such as elephants, face a different problem because of their relatively small ratio of surface area to volume ( Haldane's  principle). This ratio compares the volume of an animal with the area of its skin: as an animal gets bigger, its surface area increases more slowly than its volume. At a certain point, the amount of heat radiated away through the skin drops below the amount of heat produced inside the body, forcing animals to use additional methods to avoid overheating. In the case of elephants, they have little hair as adults, and have large ears which increase their surface area, and have behavioral adaptations as well (such as using the trunk to spray water on themselves and mud wallowing). These behaviors increase cooling through evaporation.   Large dinosaurs would presumably have had to deal with similar issues; their body size suggest they lost heat relatively slowly to the surrounding air, and so could have been what are called  inertial homeotherms , animals that are warmer than their environments through sheer size rather than through special adaptations like those of birds or mammals. However, so far this theory fails to account for the numerous dog- and goat-sized dinosaur species, or the young of larger species.   Modern  computerized tomography  (CT) scans of a  dinosaur 's chest cavity (conducted in 2000) found the apparent remnants of a four-chambered heart, much like those found in today's mammals and birds. [ 83 ]  The idea is controversial within the scientific community, coming under fire for bad anatomical science [ 84 ]  or simply wishful thinking. [ 85 ]  The question of how this find reflects on metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy may be moot, though, regardless of the object's identity: both modern  crocodilians  and  birds , the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well. [ 86 ]     Soft tissue and DNA           Scipionyx samniticus  fossil showing tissue impressions, at the  Museo Civico di Storia Naturale , in Milan, Italy.       One of the best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in  Petraroia ,  Italy . The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young  coelurosaur ,  Scipionyx  samniticus . The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur. [ 43 ]   In the March 2005 issue of  Science , the paleontologist  Mary Higby Schweitzer  and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old  Tyrannosaurus rex  leg  bone  from the  Hell Creek Formation  in  Montana . After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team. [ 44 ]   When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as  blood vessels , bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear; study and interpretation of the material is ongoing. [ 44 ]   Newer research, published in PloS One (30 July 2008), has challenged the claims that the material found is the soft tissue of  Tyrannosaurus . Thomas Kaye of the  University of Washington  and his co-authors contend that what was really inside the tyrannosaur bone was slimy  biofilm  created by bacteria that coated the voids once occupied by blood vessels and cells. [ 87 ]  The researchers found that what previously had been identified as remnants of blood cells, because of the presence of iron, were actually  framboids , microscopic mineral spheres bearing iron. They found similar spheres in a variety of other fossils from various periods, including an  ammonite . In the ammonite they found the spheres in a place where the iron they contain could not have had any relationship to the presence of blood. [ 88 ]   The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions, but upon further inspection and  peer review , neither of these reports could be confirmed. [ 89 ]  However, a functional visual  peptide  of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds. [ 90 ]  In addition, several  proteins  have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils, [ 91 ]  including hemoglobin. [ 92 ]   Even if dinosaur DNA could be reconstructed, it would be exceedingly difficult to clone and ""grow"" dinosaurs using current technology since no closely related species exist to provide  zygotes  or a suitable environment for  embryonic development .     Feathers and the origin of birds   Main article:  Origin of birds   The possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by  Thomas Henry Huxley . [ 93 ]  After the work of  Gerhard Heilmann  in the early 20th century, the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of generalized  thecodont  ancestors, with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of  clavicles  in dinosaurs. [ 94 ]  However, as later discoveries showed, clavicles (or a single fused  wishbone , which derived from separate clavicles) were not actually absent; [ 8 ]  they had been found as early as 1924 in  Oviraptor , but misidentified as an  interclavicle . [ 95 ]  In the 1970s,  John Ostrom  revived the dinosaur-bird theory, [ 96 ]  which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis, [ 97 ]  and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds. [ 18 ]  Of particular note has been the fossils of the  Yixian Formation , where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found, often with feathers of some type. [ 8 ]  Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives. [ 98 ]  They are most closely allied with  maniraptoran  coelurosaurs. [ 8 ]  A minority of scientists, most notably  Alan Feduccia  and  Larry Martin , have proposed other evolutionary paths, including revised versions of Heilmann's basal archosaur proposal, [ 99 ]  or that maniraptoran theropods are the ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs, only  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ]     Feathers   Main article:  Feathered dinosaurs          The famous Berlin Specimen of  Archaeopteryx lithographica .       Archaeopteryx , the first good example of a ""feathered dinosaur"", was discovered in 1861. The initial specimen was found in the  Solnhofen limestone  in southern Germany, which is a  lagersttte , a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils.  Archaeopteryx  is a  transitional fossil , with features clearly intermediate between those of modern reptiles and birds. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal  The Origin of Species , its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of  evolutionary biology  and  creationism . This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for  Compsognathus . [ 101 ]   Since the 1990s, a number of additional  feathered dinosaurs  have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the  lagersttte  of the Yixian Formation,  Liaoning , northeastern  China , which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found only in a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be due to the fact that delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by  fossilization  and thus are absent from the fossil record. To this point, protofeathers (thin, filament-like structures) are known from dinosaurs at the base of Coelurosauria, such as  compsognathids  like  Sinosauropteryx  and  tyrannosauroids  ( Dilong ), [ 102 ]  but barbed feathers are only known among the coelurosaur subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. [ 8 ] [ 103 ]  The description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that protofeathers are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' integument, [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with barbed feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but  convergent  with dinosaurs. [ 100 ] [ 105 ]  However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the question of the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been raised. [ 107 ]     Skeleton   Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the  missing link  between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for  paleontologists . Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck,  pubis ,  wrist  (semi-lunate  carpal ), arm and  pectoral girdle , furcula (wishbone), and  breast bone . Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through  cladistic analysis  strengthens the case for the link.     Soft anatomy   Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation which was led by  Patrick O'Connor  of  Ohio University . The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their  skeletons , as is the case in birds. ""What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds"", O'Connor said. [ 108 ]  In a paper published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE (September 29, 2008), scientists described  Aerosteon riocoloradensis , the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like breathing system.  CT-scanning  revealed the evidence of air sacs within the body cavity of the  Aerosteon  skeleton. [ 109 ] [ 110 ]   Another piece of evidence that birds and dinosaurs are closely related is the use of  gizzard  stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with  fossils , gizzard stones are called  gastroliths . [ 111 ]     Reproductive biology   A discovery of features in a  Tyrannosaurus rex   skeleton  recently provided more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs between the hard outer bone and the  marrow . This  medullary  bone, which is rich in  calcium , is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally-derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the  Tyrannosaurus rex  specimen's hind limb suggested that  T. rex  used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female. [ 112 ]  Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod  Allosaurus  and ornithopod  Tenontosaurus . Because the line of dinosaurs that includes  Allosaurus  and  Tyrannosaurus  diverged from the line that led to  Tenontosaurus  very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue. Medullary bone has been found in specimens of sub-adult size, which suggests that dinosaurs reached sexual maturity rather quickly for such large animals. [ 113 ]     Behavioral evidence   A recently discovered  troodont  fossil demonstrates that some dinosaurs slept like certain modern birds, with their heads tucked under their arms. [ 114 ]  This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds.     Extinction   Main articles:  CretaceousTertiary extinction event  and  KT boundary   Non-avian dinosaurs suddenly became  extinct  approximately 65 million years ago. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including  ammonites  ( nautilus -like  mollusks ),  mosasaurs , plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, herbivorous  turtles  and  crocodiles , most birds, and many groups of mammals. [ 16 ]  This  mass extinction  is known as the  CretaceousTertiary extinction event . The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the general consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.   At the peak of the Mesozoic, there were no  polar ice caps , and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250 meters (300 to 800 ft) higher than they are today. The planet's temperature was also much more uniform, with only 25  C  (45  F ) separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator. On average, atmospheric temperatures were also much warmer; the poles, for example, were 50 C (90 F) warmer than today. [ 115 ] [ 116 ]   The atmosphere's composition during the Mesozoic was vastly different as well. Carbon dioxide levels were up to 12 times higher than today's levels, and oxygen formed 32 to 35% of the atmosphere, as compared to 21% today. However, by the late Cretaceous, the environment was changing dramatically. Volcanic activity was decreasing, which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably. Some scientists hypothesize that climate change, combined with lower oxygen levels, might have led directly to the demise of many species. If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds, it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency, given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies. [ 16 ]     Impact event   Main article:  Chicxulub crater          The  Chicxulub Crater  at the tip of the  Yucatn Peninsula ; the impactor that formed this crater may have caused the dinosaur extinction.       The asteroid collision theory, which was brought to wide attention in 1980 by  Walter Alvarez  and colleagues, links the  extinction event  at the end of the Cretaceous period to a  bolide  impact approximately 65.5 million years ago. Alvarez  et al.  proposed that a sudden increase in  iridium  levels, recorded around the world in the period's rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. [ 117 ]  The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a 5 to 15 kilometer (3 to 9 mi) wide  bolide  hit in the vicinity of the  Yucatn Peninsula , creating the 170 kilometers (110 mi) wide  Chicxulub Crater  and triggering the  mass extinction . [ 118 ]  Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the  impact event . Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave.   Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun).   In September 2007, U.S. researchers led by  William Bottke  of the  Southwest Research Institute  in  Boulder, Colorado , and  Czech  scientists used  computer  simulations to identify the probable source of the Chicxulub impact. They calculated a 90% probability that a giant asteroid named  Baptistina , approximately 160 kilometers (100 mi) in diameter, orbiting in the asteroid belt which lies between  Mars  and  Jupiter , was struck by a smaller unnamed asteroid about 55 kilometers (35 mi) in diameter about 160 million years ago. The impact shattered Baptistina, creating a cluster which still exists today as the  Baptistina family . Calculations indicate that some of the fragments were sent hurtling into earth-crossing orbits, one of which was the 10 kilometers (6 mi) wide  meteorite  which struck  Mexico 's  Yucatan   peninsula  65 million years ago, creating the  Chicxulub crater  (175 kilometers (110 mi)). [ 119 ]   While similar to Alvarez's impact theory (which involved a single asteroid or comet), this theory proposes that ""passages of the  solar companion star Nemesis  through the  Oort comet cloud  would trigger comet showers."" [ 120 ]  One or more of these objects then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time, causing the worldwide extinction. As with the impact of a single asteroid, the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures, followed by a protracted cool period. [ 120 ]     Deccan Traps   Main article:  Deccan Traps   Before 2000, arguments that the  Deccan Traps   flood basalts  caused the  extinction  were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 mya and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two-thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in 1 million years about 65.5 mya, so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly a period of thousands of years, but still a longer period than what would be expected from a single impact event. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulphuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reducing photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the  greenhouse effect  when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere. [ 122 ]  Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of  volcanic gasses  during the formation of the  Deccan traps  ""contributed to an apparently massive  global warming . Some data point to an average rise in temperature of 8 C (14 F) in the last half million years before the  impact [at Chicxulub] ."" [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction,  Luis Alvarez  (who died in 1988) replied that  paleontologists  were being misled by  sparse data . While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in  sea level  and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions. [ 123 ]     Failure to adapt to changing conditions   Lloyd  et al.  (2008) noted that, in the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering  angiosperm  plants became a major part of terrestrial  ecosystems , which had previously been dominated by  gymnosperms  such as conifers. Dinosaur  coprolites   fossilized dung  indicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs mainly ate gymnosperms. Statistical analysis by Lloyd  et al.  concluded that, contrary to earlier studies, dinosaurs did not diversify very much in the Late Cretaceous. Lloyd  et al.  suggested that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction. [ 34 ]     Possible Paleocene survivors   Nonavian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the  K-T boundary . In 2002, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single  hadrosaur  leg bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico and described it as evidence of  Paleocene dinosaurs . The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early  Paleocene  epoch approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that  stratum  by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era. [ 124 ]  Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the  Hell Creek Formation  up to 1.3 meters (51 in) above (40,000 years later than) the K-T boundary. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China. [ 125 ]  Many scientists, however, dismiss the ""Paleocene dinosaurs"" as re-worked, i.e. washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments, [ 126 ] [ 127 ]  or find that, if correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction. [ 126 ]     History of discovery   Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese, whose modern word for dinosaur is  konglong  (, or ""terrible dragon""), considered them to be  dragon   bones  and documented them as such. For example,  Hua Yang Guo Zhi , a book written by Zhang Qu during the  Western Jin Dynasty , reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in  Sichuan  Province. [ 128 ]  Villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized ""dragon bones"" for use in traditional medicines, a practice that continues today. [ 129 ]  In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of  giants  and other creatures killed by the  Great Flood .   Scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in  England . Part of a bone, now known to have been the  femur  of a  Megalosaurus , [ 130 ]  was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near  Chipping Norton ,  Oxfordshire , England in 1676. The fragment was sent to  Robert Plot , Professor of Chemistry at the  University of Oxford  and first curator of the  Ashmolean Museum , who published a description in his  Natural History of Oxfordshire  in 1677. He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the  femur  of a large animal, but recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species. He therefore concluded it to be the thigh bone of a giant human similar to those mentioned in the  Bible . In 1699,  Edward Lhuyd , a friend of  Sir Isaac Newton , was responsible for the first published scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a  sauropod   tooth , "" Rutellum implicatum "" [ 131 ] [ 132 ] , that had been found in Caswell, near Whitney, Oxfordshire. [ 133 ]           William Buckland .       Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev  William Buckland , a professor of  geology  at  Oxford University , collected more fossilized bones of  Megalosaurus  and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a  scientific journal . [ 134 ] [ 130 ]  The second dinosaur genus to be identified,  Iguanodon , was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell - the wife of English geologist  Gideon Mantell . Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between  his fossils  and the bones of modern  iguanas . He published his findings in 1825. [ 135 ] [ 136 ]   The study of these ""great fossil lizards"" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist  Richard Owen  coined the term ""dinosaur"". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far,  Iguanodon ,  Megalosaurus  and  Hylaeosaurus , shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of  Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha , the husband of  Queen Victoria , Owen established the  Natural History Museum  in  South Kensington ,  London , to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.   In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in  marl  pits in the small town of  Haddonfield, New Jersey  (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named  Hadrosaurus  foulkii . It was an extremely important find;  Hadrosaurus  was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found and it was clearly a  bipedal  creature. ( The first  was in 1834, in Maidstone, Kent, England) This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the  United States .           Othniel Charles Marsh , 19th century photograph.               Edward Drinker Cope , 19th century photograph.       Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Othniel Charles Marsh , both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the  Bone Wars . The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an  Elasmosaurus  skeleton was flawed; Cope had inadvertently placed the  plesiosaur 's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the  US Geological Survey . Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods; for example, their diggers often used  dynamite  to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast; Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, for a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the  American Museum of Natural History  in  New York , while Marsh's is on display at the  Peabody Museum of Natural History  at  Yale University . [ 137 ]   Since 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils has extended to every continent, including  Antarctica . The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered, the  ankylosaurid   Antarctopelta oliveroi , was found on  Ross Island  in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod  Cryolophosaurus ellioti , was formally named and described in a scientific journal.   Current dinosaur ""hot spots"" include southern South America (especially  Argentina ) and  China . China in particular has produced many exceptional  feathered dinosaur  specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to  fossilization .     The ""dinosaur renaissance""   Main article:  Dinosaur renaissance   The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by  John Ostrom 's discovery of  Deinonychus , an active predator that may have been  warm-blooded , in marked contrast to the then-prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and  cold-blooded .  Vertebrate paleontology  has become a global  science . Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including  India , South America,  Madagascar ,  Antarctica , and most significantly in  China  (the amazingly well-preserved  feathered dinosaurs  in  China  have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of  cladistics , which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in  classifying  dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary  fossil record .     Cultural depictions   Main article:  Cultural depictions of dinosaurs          A  Megalosaurus  stalks  Crystal Palace Park  in  London .       By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word ""dinosaur"" into the common  vernacular  reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, ""dinosaur"" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, slow-moving, obsolete, or bound for extinction. [ 138 ]   Public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in  Victorian  England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, the famous  dinosaur sculptures  were unveiled in  London 's  Crystal Palace Park . The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and  museums  around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way. [ 139 ]  Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the  Bone Wars  of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions. [ 140 ]   The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in  literature ,  film  and other  media . Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in  Charles Dickens'   Bleak House , [ 141 ]  dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of  fictional  works.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's 1912 book  The Lost World , the iconic 1933  film   King Kong , 1954's  Godzilla  and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel  Jurassic Park  by  Michael Crichton  and its 1993  film adaptation  are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest  non-fictional  works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in  advertising ; numerous  companies  have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted or obsolete. [ 142 ]     Religious views   Main article:  Young Earth Creationism#Palaeontology and dinosaurs   Various religious groups have views about dinosaurs that differ from those held by the vast majority of scientists, usually due to conflicts with  creation stories  in their scriptures. However, most of the  scientific  community rejects these religiously-inspired interpretations of dinosaurs.

A flightless seabird, they are extremely         adept at swimming in the ocean. They will spend long periods swimming         and hunting for food throughout the day. Though quite clumsy on land,         they live on rocky shores during the cool nights as well as when         they are nesting and caring for their young.             The coloration of their coats, black on top and white underneath,         makes a great camouflage in the ocean. Predators looking up from below         them see only as light colors similar to the sky while the black on top         makes them difficult for predators above to distinguish them from the         sea. Their coloration is not as much help on land and they are much more         clumsy, making them vulnerable to both predators and humans.                                 Toga's Story                     About             the African (Jackass) Penguin                                          Toga,   a baby penguin, was snatched from his parents and home about a week before Christmas.                 12/18/2005                  Just a baby about 3 months old, Toga lived with his parents Oscar and Kyala and  four other adult Jackass Penguins. The adults became residents of Britain's  Amazon World Zoo Park  on the Isle of Wight in 2002. Toga was the first baby African (Jackass) Penguin to be successfully bred here.                 Toga was born in September 2005. The zoo keepers reportedly said that Toga was too young for them to determine gender, therefore they refer to the young penguin as a ""he"". Being a baby he is described as  still having  juvenile coloring of  brown and white and his parents were still feeding him regurgitated food. Dependent on  his parents care,  he would not take food from people or feed on his own.                 From various news reports, it is said that there was no evidence of forced entry, rather it is thought that someone could have climbed over an outer fence into the zoo and then over another fence surrounding the penguin's enclosure to carry the baby penguin  away.                 Zoo officials reportedly believe that Toga could probably only survive for about five days without his parents. That amount of time has come and gone, and nothing has been determined about the young penguin's fate.                 This is a very sad story about a beautiful animal. We can only hope for the best for little Toga until we hear more. Let this incident help us all to be more aware of the special needs of our animal friends and encourage people to act responsibly,...not as ""Dummies"".                          Distribution:    African Penguins or Jackass Penguins are found only off the coast of Southern Africa between Port Elizabeth and Namibia. They are one of 16 species of penguins but are the only nesting penguin in Africa. They nest in colonies, mainly on 24 offshore islands, though several colonies  have also become established on the mainland. A colony on St. Croix Island near Port Elizabeth is one of the largest with about 50,000 penguins.               Social Behavior :    The African (Jackass) Penguins are gregarious. As adults they live in fairly large groups of between 50 to 100 penguins, though while they are nurturing their young they are more secluded. Once the young penguins reach maturity they will join with a mate for life. They are excellent parents, forming a strong nurturing bond with their young.               Description:     This is a rather small little bird  being only about 24"" - 28"" (60 - 71 cm) tall and weighing between 6.3 - 8 pounds (2.84 - 3.6 kg). In the wild their average life span is about 20 years but they have been known to live up to 30 years in captivity.     The streamlined body of the African (Jackass) Penguin  is shaped rather like a bowling pin, stocky and quite robust. They have webbed feet, a wedge shaped tail, and small flippers on the sides.     An adult is black on top, white with varied spotting underneath, and has a distinct black stripe running up the sides and across the chest in a horseshoe shape. Over their eyes is whitish bare skin that will turn bright reddish pink when they are getting hot. Males are a bit larger and have a longer bill than the females. Juveniles differ in coloring, starting out with a slate blue color on top that soon turns brown and then gradually turns black. They mature at about 3 to 4 years of age.     Their feathers are  very thick, short,  and shiny. The feathers are waterproof and keep their skin dry. Rather than having a layer of blubber like seals and whales, African penguins  have a layer of trapped air under the feathers to protect them from the cold. They molt once a year for about a three week period, loosing their existing feathers and replacing them with new ones. They cannot swim during this time and they also do not eat while molting.               Swimming:     Though they are flightless birds, the African (Jackass) Penguins are incredibly agile in the water. Using their webbed feet to steer they can swim quite fast, averaging about 4.3 miles (7 km) per hour and when needed they can produce short fast bursts of speed reaching about 15 miles (24 km) per hour. When diving they can go deeper than any other bird and they can hold their breath for up to about 20 minutes.               Feeding:      African Penguins or Jackass Penguins are carnivores and they hunt for their food in the ocean. Their diet  once consisted mainly of oil rich pilchards, but today it includes many other fish that are more readily available. They eat a variety of fish including sardines, anchovy, sancord (an eel like fish), and maasbanker (African sad); along with squid and crustaceans.               Breeding :     The African (Jackass) Penguins naturally like to nest by burrowing  deep into layers of hardened quano (bird droppings) along the rocky shores, but the guano was heavily harvested in the 19th century for fertilizer. Today they nest by burrowing into sand or under overhanging rocks or bushes, and sometimes out in the open.               The female will lay two eggs, which will incubate for 38 - 42 days. Once the young are hatched both parents assist in guarding the nest and caring for the young. They take turns hunting and feeding them with regurgitated fish for approximately eight weeks. After this time the young must learn to fend for themselves. They reach maturity at three to four years of age.                                                     Threats to the African Penguin              How to Help                                   The  African  Penguin population has declined approximately 90% in the last 60 years!                 Once numbering several million, the African (Jackass) Penguin were heavily harvested by sailors and settlers in the late 1800's. By the early 1900's they numbered only about 1.2 million.               Today their total  number is only  about 120,000 penguins!                 Several factors contributed to the              decline of the African (Jackass) Penguin.                  During the nineteenth century there             was large scale removal of the nutrient rich guano, a hardish bird             dropping substance which the penguins burrowed into for nesting.             This has caused ongoing problems of inadequate nest burrowing sites.             Those that remain are subject to heat and flooding by rain, and competition             for sites with larger seals. Penguin nesting sites and  colonies             on the mainland  are vulnerable to mainland predators not encountered             on the islands.               Currently the biggest threats  are:                                 Oil spills:  Oil                   spills over the last 30 years have taken a large toll on the                   African (Jackass) Penguin and continue to be a potential risk.                   Two oils spills, one in 1994 and another in 2000, killed 30,000                   penguins. When the penguin's feathers become covered with oil,                   the air trapped beneath them is damaged and ineffective, no                   longer protecting them from the cold.                 Food shortages:  Diminished food supplies is thought to be due to commercial fishing, especially of anchovies and pilchard, along with  changes in environmental conditions.                 Human interference:  Human                   disruptions include egg removal, colony disturbance, and the                   close proximity of shipping ports to nesting colonies.                 Increased natural competition and predation:  This includes disruption by the Cape Fur Seal  Arctocephalus pusillus  for nesting sites and food (as well as being attacked and eaten), and predation on eggs and chicks by the Kelp Gull  Larus dominicanus,   Straw-necked   Ibis  Threskiornis spinicollis , and feral cats on the mainland.                                      Southern African National Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB)                    Formed 20 years ago to help rescue penguins from oil spills and other disasters, SANCCOB  has rehabilitated the African (Jackass) Penguin with great success. It is estimated that their population is 19% larger than it would be without these efforts.                   SANCCOB  rescues and rehabilitates many injured seabirds. It is funded solely by membership fees and  public donations. More than 80% of birds admitted   for rehabilitation are returned successfully to the wild. This is the most successful sea bird rehabilitation center in the world.

Ways in which you can help:                               Support SANCCOB as a volunteer. This involves cleaning and feeding rescued penguins and other seabirds.                  Take oiled or injured penguins or seabirds to   SANCCOB.                 Financially support  SANCCOB.                 There are several other wildlife organizations listed on the SANCCOB site that also invite volunteers.                                 The African (Jackass) Penguin colonies at Boulders Beach and Robben   Island are very popular tourist attractions!                           Conservation efforts  that have been put into effect:             Fences have been erected around some breeding grounds to help prevent  human disturbance and attacks by predators.               Steps have been taken to secure penguin breeding   sites from seals as well as efforts  to eliminate feral   cat populations.               Islands that support nesting colonies are protected as provincial nature reserves or fall within the West Coast   National Park.

clueweb09-en0011-05-38770	"   Click here for the updated InfoBook -  Penguins .   Adaptations for an Aquatic Environment    A. Swimming    1 .Some penguin species spend as much as 75% of their lives in the sea. Some species spend several months at a time at sea, only coming ashore for breeding and molting (del Hoyo, et al., 1992). The Fiordland crested penguins sometimes grow barnacles on their tails, an indication that they are at sea for long periods (Muller-Schwarze, 1984).     2. Swimming speeds generally are not well known (Kooyman, 1975). Earlier estimates    of swimming speeds were taken from observations of penguins swimming alongside    moving ships, a method that proved to be unreliable (Croxall and Davis, 1990).    The fastest swimmers belong to the genus  Aptenodytes . Emperors have been    observed swimming 14.4 kph (8.9 mph), though they normally do not exceed 10.8    kph (6.7 mph). Both kings and chinstraps have been recorded at 8.6 kph (5.3    mph), Adélies at 7.9 kph (4.9 mph), and fairy penguins at 2.5 kph (1.6    mph) (del Hoyo, et al., 19921- Marchant, 1990).     3. To maintain streamlining with least resistance while swimming under water, a penguin keeps its head hunched into its shoulders. The feet are pressed close to the body against the tail to aid in steering (Marchant, 1990).     4. Penguin wings are paddlelike flippers used for swimming. The motion of the flippers resembles the wing movements of flying birds, giving penguins the appearance of flying through the water (del Hoyo, et al., 1992). The wing and breast muscles are well developed, to propel the penguins through water, a medium much denser than air (del Hoyo, et al., 1992).     5. Having solid, dense bones helps penguins overcome buoyancy (Simpson, 1976).     6. Although it is more energy efficient for penguins to swim under water than    at the water surface, they must come to the surface to breathe. They compromise    by ""porpoising"" - leaping in and out of the water, like dolphins or    porpoises (Sparks and Soper, 1987).       a. They are able to continue breathing without interrupting forward momentum.      They can maintain a steady speed of 7 to 10 kph (4.3-6.2 mph). Porpoising      also may confuse predators (Sparks and Soper, 1987; del Hoyo, et al., 1992).         b. Not all species exhibit porpoising. Emperors are not known to porpoise,      and this behavior is infrequent in kings and members of the genus  Spheniscus ,      but common in other penguins (del Hoyo, et al., 1992).      B. Diving    1. Most prey of penguins inhabit the upper water layers, so most penguins generally do not have to dive to great depths or for long periods (Moller-Schwarze, 1984).        a. Most species stay submerged less than a minute, but gentoo and Adélie      penguins have been recorded staying under water for seven minutes (del Hoyo,      et al., 1992).      b. Chinstraps can reach depths of 70 m (230 ft.), but most dives are less      than 45 m (148 ft.). Nearly half are less than 10 m (33 ft.), and last between      20 and 30 seconds (Sparks and Soper, 1987).       2. Studies using radio tracking and automatic depth recorders reveal that emperor penguins sometimes hunt at great depths (Sparks and Soper, 1987).        a. Emperors hunt fast midwater squids and fishes and therefore tend to dive more deeply   and remain submerged longer than other penguins (Sparks and Soper, 1987).      b. The deepest dive recorded for an emperor penguin was 535 m (1,755 ft.). The longest   recorded dive for an emperor was 21 minutes. Both of these measurements are considered   extremes; most dives are within 21 m (70 ft.) of the surface and last two to eight   minutes. (Kooyman, pers. comm., Sparks and Soper, 1987; Simpson, 1976; del Hoyo, et al.,   1992).       3. During deep dives, the penguin heart rate slows.        a. Adélie and gentoo penguins reduce their heart rate from 80 to 100      beats per minute (bpm) to about 20 bpm (Muller-Schwarze, 1984).      b. The heart rate of a diving emperor penguin is about 15% lower than its      resting heart rate (Kooyman, 1992).       4. Under experimental diving conditions, penguins exhibit reduced peripheral blood flow (Scholander, 1940). The extent of blood redistribution during deep dives in penguins is still unknown (Ponganis and Kooyman, 1990).    C. Respiration    When swimming, penguins inhale and exhale rapidly at the surface (Simpson, 1976).    D. Salt secretion    Like other seabirds, penguins have glands in the bill that help rid the body of excess salt. The secretion of salt and fluid often collect as droplets on the bill and are shaken off. These glands are so effective that penguins can drink sea water without ill effects (Simpson, 1976).    E. Sleep    1 . A penguin sleeps with its bill tucked behind a flipper, which some sources believe serves no known purpose in penguins, but is a remnant of ancestral relations to flighted birds (Sparks and Soper, 1987). Other researchers believe the behavior may reduce the amount of heat lost through the face, particularly the nostrils (Campbell and Lack, 1985).     2. To conserve energy while fasting, penguins may increase the time they spend sleeping (Davis and Darby, 1990).     3. During the antarctic winter, when the period of darkness may last more than 20 hours, huddling emperor penguins incubating eggs may spend most of a 24-hour period sleeping (Groscolas, 1990).      To release excess heat, penguins may hold their flippers away from their bodies, so both surfaces of the flippers are exposed to air.    F. Thermoregulation    1 . The internal temperature range of penguins is 37.8 to 38.9 (100-102)    (Simpson, 1976).    2. Overlapping feathers create a surface practically impenetrable to wind or    water. Feathers provide waterproofing critical to penguins' survival in water    that may be as cold as -2.2 (28) in the Antarctic. Tufts of down on shafts    below the feathers trap air. This layer of air provides 80% to 84% of the thermal    insulation for penguins (Muller-Schwarze, 1984; Sparks and Soper, 1987). The    layer of trapped air is compressed during dives and can dissipate after prolonged    diving. Penguins rearrange their feathers by preening (Moller-Schwarze, 1984).      3. To conserve heat, penguins may tuck in their flippers close to their bodies. They also may shiver to generate additional heat (Marchant, 1990).     4. A well defined fat layer improves insulation in cold water, but probably is not enough to keep body temperature stable at sea for long. Penguins must remain active while in water to generate body heat (Sparks and Soper, 1987).     5. Species in colder climates tend to have longer feathers and thicker fat than those in warmer climates (Simpson, 1976).     6. The dark plumage of a penguin's dorsal surface absorbs heat from the sun, which increases body temperature (del Hoyo, et al., 1992).     7. On land, king and emperor penguins tip up their feet, and rest their entire weight on the heels and tail, reducing contact with the icy surface (del Hoyo, et al., 1992).    8. Emperor penguins huddle together to conserve heat (Simpson, 1976). As many as 6,000 males will cluster while incubating eggs during the middle of the antarctic winter (Sparks and Soper, 1987).    9. Emperor penguins are able to recapture 80% of heat escaping in their breath through a complex heat exchange system in their nasal passages (Sparks and Soper, 1987).    10. On land, overheating may sometimes be a problem.              a. Penguins may prevent overheating by moving into shaded areas and by panting     (Marchant, 1990).        b. Penguins can ruffle their feathers, breaking up the insulating air layer next to the     skin and releasing heat (Sparks and Soper, 1987).        c. If a penguin is too warm, it holds its flippers away from its body, so both surfaces     of the flippers are exposed to air, releasing heat (Sparks and Soper, 1987).        d. Temperate species, like the Humboldt and African penguins, lack feathers on their     legs and have bare patches on their faces. Excess heat can dissipate through these areas     (Sparks and Soper, 1987).           11. A penguin's circulatory system adjusts to conserve or release body heat to maintain body temperature.              a. To conserve heat, blood flowing to the flippers and legs transfers its heat to blood     returning to the heart. This countercurrent heat exchange helps ensure that heat remains     in the body (Brooke and Birkhead, 1991).        b. If the body becomes too warm, blood vessels in the skin dilate, bringing heat from     within the body to the surface, where it is dissipated (Sparks and Soper, 1987).

Fossils  of  Archaeopteryx  include well-preserved  feathers , but it was not until the early 1990s that clearly nonavian dinosaur fossils were discovered with preserved feathers. Today there are more than twenty genera of dinosaurs with fossil feathers, all of which are  theropods . Most are from the  Yixian formation  in China. The fossil feathers of one specimen,  Shuvuuia deserti , have even tested positive for  beta-keratin , the main protein in bird feathers, in immunological tests.

Shortly after the 1859 publication of  Charles Darwin 's  The Origin of Species , British  biologist  and  evolution -defender  Thomas Henry Huxley  proposed that birds were descendants of dinosaurs. He cited skeletal similarities, particularly among some  saurischian  dinosaurs, fossils of the 'first bird'  Archaeopteryx lithographica  and modern birds. In 1868 he published  On the Animals which are Most Nearly Intermediate between Birds and Reptiles , making the case. The leading dinosaur expert of the time,  Richard Owen , disagreed, claiming  Archaeopteryx  as the first bird outside dinosaur lineage. For the next century, claims that birds were dinosaur descendants faded, with more popular bird-ancestry hypotheses including 'crocodylomorph' and ' thecodont ' ancestors, rather than dinosaurs or other  archosaurs .   In 1964,  John Ostrom  described  Deinonychus antirrhopus , a  theropod  whose skeletal resemblance to birds seemed unmistakable. Ostrom has since become a leading proponent of the theory that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs. Further comparisons of bird and dinosaur skeletons, as well as  cladistic analysis  strengthened the case for the link, particularly for a branch of theropods called  maniraptors . Skeletal similarities include the  neck , the  pubis , the  wrists  (semi-lunate  carpal ), the ' arms ' and  pectoral girdle , the  shoulder blade , the  clavicle  and the  breast bone . In all, over a hundred distinct anatomical features are shared by birds and theropod dinosaurs.   Other researchers drew on these shared features and other aspects of dinosaur biology and began to suggest that at least some theropod dinosaurs were feathered. The first restoration of a feathered dinosaur was Sarah Landry's depiction of a feathered ""Syntarsus"" (now renamed  Megapnosaurus  or considered a synonym of  Coelophysis ), in  Robert T. Bakker 's 1975 publication  Dinosaur Renaissance . [ 2 ]  Gregory S. Paul was probably the first paleoartist to depict maniraptoran dinosaurs with feathers and protofeathers, starting in the late 1980s.   By the 1990s, most paleontologists considered birds to be surviving dinosaurs and referred to 'non-avian dinosaurs' (all extinct), to distinguish them from birds ( aves  or avian dinosaurs). Direct evidence to support the theory was missing, however. Some mainstream ornithologists, including  Smithsonian Institution  curator  Storrs L. Olson , disputed the links, citing the lack of fossil evidence for feathered dinosaurs.     [ edit ]   Fossil evidence   After a century of hypotheses without hard evidence, particularly well-preserved (and legitimate) fossils of feathered dinosaurs were discovered during the 1990s and 2000s. The fossils were preserved in a  Lagersttte   a  sedimentary  deposit exhibiting remarkable richness and completeness in its fossils  in  Liaoning ,  China . The area had repeatedly been smothered in volcanic ash produced by eruptions in  Inner Mongolia  124 million years ago, during the Early  Cretaceous   Period . The fine-grained ash preserved the living organisms that it buried in fine detail. The area was teeming with life, with millions of leaves,  angiosperms  (the oldest known),  insects ,  fish ,  frogs ,  salamanders ,  mammals ,  turtles ,  lizards  and  crocodilians  discovered to date.   The most important discoveries at Liaoning have been a host of feathered dinosaur fossils, with a steady stream of new finds filling in the picture of the dinosaur-bird connection and adding more to theories of the evolutionary development of feathers and flight.   Norell et al (2007) reported quill knobs from an ulna of  Velociraptor mongoliensis , and these are strongly correlated with large and well-developed secondary feathers. [ 3 ]   Behavioural evidence, in the form of an  oviraptorosaur  on its nest, showed another link with  birds . Its forearms were folded, like those of a  bird . Although no  feathers  were preserved, it is likely that these would have been present to insulate eggs and juveniles.     [ edit ]   Genuine feathers?   There have been claims that the supposed feathers of the Chinese fossils were a preservation artifact. [ 4 ]  Despite doubts, the fossil feathers have roughly the same appearance as those of birds fossilized in the same locality, so there is no serious reason to think they are of different nature; moreover, no non-theropod fossil from the same site shows such an artifact, but sometimes show unambiguous hair (some mammals) or scales (some reptiles). [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   The Archaeoraptor fake   In 1999, a supposed 'missing link' fossil of an apparently feathered dinosaur named "" Archaeoraptor liaoningensis "", found in  Liaoning Province , northeastern  China , turned out to be a forgery. Comparing the photograph of the specimen with another find, Chinese paleontologist  Xu Xing  came to the conclusion that it was composed of two portions of different fossil animals. His claim made  National Geographic  review their research and they too came to the same conclusion. [ 5 ]  The bottom portion of the ""Archaeoraptor"" composite came from a legitimate feathered dromaeosaurid now known as  Microraptor , and the upper portion from a previously-known primitive bird called  Yanornis .

Fossil specimen of  Microraptor gui .       A number of non-avian dinosaurs are now known to have been feathered. Direct evidence of feathers exists for the following genera, listed in the order currently accepted evidence was first published. In all examples, the evidence described consists of feather impressions, except those marked with an asterisk (*), which denotes genera known to have had feathers based on skeletal or chemical evidence, such as the presence of quill knobs or  beta-keratin .     Avimimus * (1987) [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   Sinosauropteryx  (1996) [ 8 ]   Protarchaeopteryx  (1997) [ 9 ]   Caudipteryx  (1998) [ 10 ]   Rahonavis * (1998) [ 11 ]   Shuvuuia * (1999) [ 1 ]   Sinornithosaurus  (1999) [ 12 ]   Beipiaosaurus  (1999) [ 13 ]   Microraptor  (2000) [ 14 ]   Nomingia * (2000) [ 15 ]   Cryptovolans  (2002) [ 16 ]   Scansoriopteryx  (2002) [ 17 ]   Epidendrosaurus  (2002) [ 18 ]   Yixianosaurus  (2003) [ 19 ]   Dilong  (2004) [ 20 ]   Pedopenna  (2005) [ 21 ]   Jinfengopteryx  (2005) [ 22 ] [ 23 ]   Sinocalliopteryx  (2007) [ 24 ]   Velociraptor * (2007) [ 3 ]   Epidexipteryx  (2008) [ 25 ]   Anchiornis  (2009) [ 26 ]       [ edit ]   Primitive feather types   The evolution of feather structures is thought to have proceeded from simple hollow filaments through several stages of increasing complexity, ending with the large, deeply rooted, feathers with strong pens ( rachis ), barbs and barbules that birds display today. [ 27 ]   It is logical that the simplest structures were probably most useful as insulation, and that this implies  homeothermy . Only the more complex feather structures would be likely candidates for aerodynamic uses.   It is not known with certainty at what point in  archosaur  phylogeny the earliest simple protofeathers arose, or if they arose once or, independently, multiple times. Filamentous structures are clearly present in  Pterosaurs , and long, hollow quills have been reported in a specimen of  Psittacosaurus  from  Liaoning . [ 28 ]  It is thus possible that the genes for building simple integumentary structures from beta keratin arose before the origin of dinosaurs, possibly in the last common ancestor with pterosaurs  the basal  Ornithodire .   Most of the theropods known to have feathers are  maniraptorans . Only a few non- maniraptoran  theropods are known to have them as well. At present, the most primitive (known) theropod dinosaur with integumentary filaments is  Sinosauropteryx , a  compsognathid  (Jurassic/Cretaceous, 150-120  mya ), whose body was covered with feather-like structures that look like hollow tubes, or hairs. They may or may not have had barbs, like  downy  (plumaceous) feathers. Another very primitive theropod,  Dilong paradoxus  (Early Cretaceous), an ancestor of  Tyrannosaurus rex , had similar simple feather structures. The  alvarezsaurid   Shuvuuia  is sometimes found to be outside the  maniraptora , but consensus right now places it as a maniraptoran.   The first dinosaur fossils from the  Yixian formation  found to have true flight-structured feathers ( pennaceous feathers ) were  Protarchaeopteryx  and  Caudipteryx  (135-121 mya). Due to the size and proportions of these animals it is more likely that their feathers were used for display rather than for flight. Subsequent dinosaurs found with pennaceous feathers include  Pedopenna  and  Jinfengopteryx . Several specimens of  Microraptor , described by Xu  et al.  in 2003, show not only pennaceous feathers but also true asymmetrical flight feathers, present on the fore and hind limbs and tail. Asymmetrical feathers are considered important for flight in birds. Before the discovery of  Microraptor gui ,  Archaeopteryx  was the most primitive known animal with asymmetrical flight feathers.     [ edit ]   Phylogeny and the inference of feathers in other dinosaurs   Feathered dinosaur fossil finds to date, together with  cladistic analysis , suggest that many types of theropod may have had feathers, not just those that are especially similar to birds. In particular, the smaller theropod species may all have had feathers and possibly even the larger theropods (for instance  T. rex ) may have had feathers, in their early stages of development after hatching. Whereas these smaller animals may have benefitted from the insulation of feathers, large adult theropods are unlikely to have had feathers, since inertial heat retention would likely be sufficient to manage heat. Excess internal heat may even have become a problem, had these very large creatures been feathered.   Fossil feather impressions are extremely rare; therefore only a few feathered dinosaurs have been identified so far. However, through a process called  phylogenetic bracketing , scientists can infer the presence of feathers on poorly-preserved specimens. All fossil feather specimens have been found to show certain similarities. Due to these similarities and through developmental research almost all scientists agree that feathers could only have evolved once in dinosaurs. Feathers would then have been passed down to all later, more derived species (although it is possible that some lineages lost feathers secondarily). If a dinosaur falls at a point on an evolutionary tree within the known feather-bearing lineages, scientists assume it too had feathers, unless conflicting evidence is found. This technique can also be used to infer the type of feathers a species may have had, since the developmental history of feathers is now reasonably well-known. [ 27 ]   The scientists who described the (apparently unfeathered)  Juravenator  performed a  genealogical study  of coelurosaurs, including distribution of various feather types. Based on the placement of feathered species in relation to those that have not been found with any type of skin impressions, they were able to infer the presence of feathers in certain dinosaur groups. The following simplified  cladogram  follows these results, and shows the likely distribution of plumaceous (downy) and pennaceous (vaned) feathers among theropods.

Four species are on five subantarctic islands.                                                                                                                                                                                                           Yellow-eyed penguin (Hoiho)     Megadyptes antipodes      The yellow-eyed penguin is one of the rarest, and the fourth largest of the world's penguins.  It is endemic and the most endangered of the six New Zealand species, with the smallest population of about 2000 pairs.  It is one of three New Zealand species that is still found on the mainland, but it is limited to about 500 pairs on the southeastern coast of the South Island.  There are also 150 pairs on Stewart Island and its surrounding islands, but most of the population are on the subantarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands.                                     Snares crested penguin       Eudyptes robustus      The Snares crested  penguin, also known as the Snares Island penguin, is endemic to the island group, which has a total area of 341 ha, and is part of the New Zealand Subantarctic World Heritage Site.  Snares penguins nest in small colonies ranging from 10 to 1200 nests under the tree daisy forest on the coast of the main North East Island, and in the open on Broughton Island.  In 2000, 25,861 breediing pairs were counted on North East Island, and it was estimated there were 4000 pairs on Broughton Island.      See more                      Erect crested penguin       Eudyptes sclateri      The erect crested penguin is endemic to three New Zealand subantarctic islands.  The principal breeding colonies are on rock covered Bounty Island and scrub covered Antipodes Island, and a few breed on the Auckland Islands.  The erect crested penguin nests in large colonies on rock ledges on the coastline, and is renowned for climbing very steep cliff faces.  It is one of the largest crested penguins, weighing up to 4 kg, and standing 50 cm tall.      See more                      Fiordland crested penguin     Eudyptes pachyrhynchus      The breeding range of about 3000 pairs of Fiordland crested penguin includes the rough Fiordland coast, islands in the Foveaux Strait, and Stewart Island. It is endemic, and one of only three species that breed on the mainland.  Codfish Island off Stewart Island is co-inhabited by all three mainland penguins, the Fiordland crested, yellow-eyed, and Southern little blue.  Sub-fossil remains indicate that the Fiordland crested penguin was distributed around the South Island, and possibly the North Island.                  Eastern rockhopper penguin     Eudyptes chrysocome filholi      The rockhopper penguin is one six crested penguin species in the world, and one of the smallest at 40 cm tall and weighing 4kg.  The New Zealand subspecies breeds on Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands. As its name suggests, it is adept at moving around rocky coastline, and like the erect-crested penguin climbs steep cliffs.  Rockhoppers sometimes nest alongside erect-crested penguins on Antipodes Island, a co-habitation trend that also occurs between the Antipodes Island parakeet and Reischek's parakeet.                    Southern little blue penguin    Eudyptula minor minor    The little blue penguin is the world's smallest penguin, 25 cm tall and weighing a little more than a kilogram.  The Southern subspecies nests in South Westland, Southland, Stewart Island and the Otago Peninsula.   Genetic research of Otago specimens in 2002 shows a relationship between  E. m. minor  and  E. m. novaehollandiae  from Australia, that is closer than any other New Zealand subspecies.  This divergence occurred 1.4 to 2.5 million years ago.

White-flippered penguin    Eudyptula minor albosignata    The white-flippered penguin was first described as a separate species in 1874, but was reclassified as one the 6 subspecies of  E. minor  in 1976.  Genetic research in 2002 shows that the white-flippered penguin is more closely related to the Northern and Chatham subspecies.  It is endemic to the Banks Peninsula and Motunau Island in the Canterbury region, with only about 3,750 pairs remaining. The white-flippered penguin is barely distinguishable from the other subspecies, but can be recognised by its slightly larger size, lighter color, and a broader white band on the front of its flipper.                      Narrow-flippered penguin      Palaeeudyptes antarcticus  (Extinct)    The extinct narrow-flippered penguin, together with another fossil species  Palaeeudyptes marplesi , is the world's largest known penguin species.  It is estimated from a fossil to have stood between 110 and 140 cm tall which is bigger than the largest living penguin, the Emperor  Aptenodytes forsteri .  It is the last known  Palaeeudyptes  species.   P. antarcticus  may have evolved from  P. marplesi  or the two may have been the same species, with  P. antarcticus  evolving to a smaller size.   P. antarcticus  was the first fossil penguin known to science, described from a single, partially damaged, tarsometatarsus found in Late Oligocene Otekaike limestone from 23-28 million years ago, at Kakanui south of Omaru on the east coast of the South Island.  Other bones have been recovered from the Late Eocene (34-37 mya) on Seymour Island, Antarctica, but it has not been completely determined by current scientific methods whether the bones belong to a single species.                                                                     2006 IUCN Red List of    Threatened Species      Yellow-eyed penguin    Megadyptes antipodes   Endangered      Erect-crested penguin    Eudyptes sclateri   Endangered      Fiordland crested penguin    Eudyptes pachyrhynchus   Vulnerable      Rockhopper penguin    Eudyptes chrysocome   Vulnerable      Snares Island penguin   (Snares crested penguin)    Eudyptes robustus   Vulnerable        2005 New Zealand Threat Classification System      Erect-crested penguin    Eudyptes sclateri   [2] Nationally endangered      Fiordland crested penguin    Eudyptes pachyrhynchus   [2] Nationally endangered      Eastern rockhopper penguin    Eudyptes chrysocome filholi   [2] Nationally endangered      Yellow-eyed penguin    Megadyptes antipodes   [3] Nationally vulnerable      White-flippered penguin    Eudyptula minor albosignata   [3] Nationally vulnerable      Northern little blue penguin    Eudyptula minor iredalei   [5] Gradual decline      Southern little blue penguin    Eudyptula minor minor   [5] Gradual decline      Snares crested penguin   (Snares Island penguin)    Eudyptes robustus   [7] Range restricted      Chatham little blue penguin    Eudyptula minor chathamensis   [7] Range restricted      Extinct Pre-Pliocene penguins of New Zealand      Aptenodytes ridgeni   Ridgen's penguin      Archaeospheniscus lopdelli   Lopdell's penguin      Archaeospheniscus lowei   Lowe's penguin      Duntroonornis parvus   Duntroon penguin      Korora oliveri   Oliver's penguin      Marplesornis novaezealandiae   Harris' penguin      Pachydyptes ponderosus   New Zealand giant penguin      Palaeeudyptes antarcticus   Narrow flippered penguin      Palaeeudyptes marplesi   Marples' penguin      Platydyptes amiesi   Amies' penguin      Platydyptes novaezealandiae   Wide-flippered penguin      Pygoscelis tyreei   Tyree's penguin      Tereingaornis moisleyi   Moisley's penguin                                         Photo credit    Top left, center 8th down ; White-flippered penguin, Peter Reese    Top 2nd right, center top ;Yellow-eyed penguin, Rod Morris      Top 3rd right, center 2nd down ; Snares crested penguin, Rod Morris    Top 4th right, center 3rd down ; Erect-crested penguin, Tui De Roy    Top 5th right, center 4th down ; Fiordland crested penguin    Tui De Roy    Top 6th right ;   Eastern rockhopper penguin    Center 5th down ; Eastern rockhopper penguin, J.L.

Although the penguin is the icon of the Antarctic, many penguins prefer lower latitudes. Several species venture as far south as the Antarctic Peninsula, but only the emperors and the Adlies live along the continental coastline.      An Adlie penguin.    A typical Adlie nest.     Adlies   If you were to conjure up an image of a penguin, it would probably look quite a lot like an Adlie: With a black back and white front, its the archetypical tuxedo-clad penguin. Named for Adle, the wife of French explorer Admiral Durmont dUrville, the Adlie is also one of the best-studied penguins.   Adlies spend most of the year at sea, but in October, when spring comes to Antarctica, they head for dry land on which to build nests, mate, lay eggs, and raise their chicks. An Adlie nest is lined with small stones. Prize pebbles are squabbled over and often purloined from inattentive neighbors.   In early November, the female lays two eggs and returns to the sea to feed, leaving the male to be the eggs first caretaker. The parents take turns incubating the eggs though, which hatch in about 35 days, and they continue to alternate between gathering food and watching over the young chicks.      A newly hatched Adlie.   A young Adlie with a full stomach.     Finally, the growing chicks, too hungry to be provisioned by just one parent at a time, are left together in a tightly packed group called a crche, while both parents go hunting. In February, the juveniles exchange their down coats for seaworthy adult feathers and, along with the adults, soon leave the breeding ground for the pack ice.   Adlies breed in a number of places along the Antarctic coast, from the Ross Sea in the south to the Antarctic Peninsula far to the north. The southernmost quartet of coloniesat Cape Crozier, Cape Bird, and Cape Royds on Ross Island and another on Beaufort Islanddiffer from each other in size, weather, and distance from the open sea. Cape Crozier, known as Penguin City, is by far the largest, with about 150,000 breeding pairs. The trip from Penguin City to the ocean is a short one, but the large number of birds means that competition for food is intense. Life is more of a picnic for the penguins in the smaller colonies, even if they must walk a bit farther to reach the food.      Adlie penguins at Cape Bird.    An Adlie tries in vain to rescue its eggs from rising glacial meltwater.     In general, though, all the Ross Sea Adlies are doing well. Climate change has brought stronger winds that keep the water near the shore almost free of ice, making feeding areas more accessible. A warmer climate is benefiting these penguinsfor the moment. But if temperatures continue to climb, these birds will face the severe problems being experienced by the Adlie in the Antarctic Peninsula region.   In the many months that the Adlies are away from land, theyre dependent on sea ice. Its where they hunt and otherwise live. If their winter habitat is diminished, so are the penguins. This is currently the plight of the Adlies near the western Antarctic Peninsulathe region of Antarctica thats experienced the greatest warming and greatest loss of sea ice. In addition, commercial fisheries and growing numbers of whales are increasingly competing for the reduced numbers of krill, a staple of the Adlie diet. This penguin population has declined by 80 percent since the 1970s.   Other climate changes will probably affect the breeding success of the Adlies. Antarctica is the driest place on earthbut with higher temperatures comes more precipitation and more meltwater from current snowfall and ancient glaciers. The pebbles that line an Adlie nest will protect the eggs from a small amount of meltwater, but a significant amount of meltwater will wash them away. And a serious snowstorm can not only destroy the eggs but can bury a stoic parent who tries to shelter them.   According to biologist David Ainley, whos been studying Adlie penguins in Antarctica for more than twenty-five years, If global warming begins to influence the more southern reaches of the Antarctic continent, then the entire worlds population of Adlie penguins could be at risk.    Emperor penguin.   Emperors    The story of the emperors is one of superlatives: They are the tallest penguins, and the heaviest. They can dive the deepest. And they breed and raise their chicks in the harshest environmental conditions.   Unlike any other penguin, emperors raise their young during the Antarctic winter. Undaunted by fierce winds and plummeting temperatures, the mature emperors heave themselves out of the sea in March and head for their breeding grounds. The trek may be a long one: In the film  March of the Penguins,  the emperors walk about 70 miles (113 km), but for some other colonies, the distance is considerably less. Most coloniesthere maybe 25 to 30breed on fast ice along the coast, although two known colonies breed on land.    Emperor penguins courting.   Courtships happen in a hurry, and in May or early June each female lays a single egg that must be carefully transferred to the feet of her mate. The male covers the egg with a flap of skin from its abdomen called a brood pouch and incubates the egg for two months. To keep warm during this dark, cold time, the papa penguins huddle closely together, taking turns being on the outside and inside of the group.   Once the eggs are safely in the care of the males, the females immediately return to the sea to hunt. If all goes well, theyll be back in time to feed their newly hatched chicks. Then, like Adlie parents, the adults alternate making trips to the sea to satisfy the voracious appetites of their fast-growing youngsters. Eventually, when the chicks are large enough to take care of themselves, the parents begin to forage at the same time. In December or January, all the birds make their way to the seaa shorter distance now that, with warmer temperatures, some of the fast ice has broken out.    Emperors march single-file from the sea to their breeding grounds in a line that may contain thousands of individuals.   The emperors have amazing adaptations that help them withstand the cold, go without food for many long weeks, and make arduous trips back and forth to the sea. Their adaptations for diving are impressive as well. Their dives have been measured to 1800 feet (550 m) and dives lasting more than 20 minutes have been recorded. Pressure increases with depth, which endangers gas-filled organs such as the lungs, but the emperors can protect their lungs by collapsing them. This stops the transfer of oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream, but the emperors conserve oxygen by slowing their heart rate during dives. They also have extraordinary amounts of oxygen stored in muscle tissue and can use virtually all the oxygen in their bloodstream before having to surface for more.    A group of emperor penguins dive beneath the ice, seen through an underwater observation tube.   Paul Ponganis, who is both a research biologist and an anesthesiologist, studies diving penguins at Antarcticas Penguin Ranch research facility with his colleague from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Jerry Kooyman. Ponganis thinks that what they learn about emperor physiology may have applications for human medical care such as for stroke victims who can sustain permanent damage if their brains dont get enough oxygen.   Emperors have successfully survived for millennia, but as the environment undergoes rapid changes, their future is uncertain. Global warming may result in thin, unstable fast ice that breaks out too early, drowning eggs or chicks. Emperors also seem likely to face a declining food supply due both to pressure from commercial fisheries and to climate change.   In December 2008, however, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service denied protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to the emperor penguin and two other penguins it had considered, although it did propose to list six penguin species. According to its news release on December 17, The Service does not have sufficient scientific information to conclude that in the foreseeable future, the habitat of the emperor penguin will be altered to the point where the species is threatened with extinction.                                                                               Adélies   Scientific name:   Pygoscelis adeliae   Height:  about 2.5 feet (75 cm)   Weight:  up to 14 pounds (6.4 kg)   Diet:  krill and fish        Emperors   Scientific name:   Aptenodytes forsteri   Height:  about 4 feet (1.2 m)   Weight:  about 65 pounds (30 kg)   Diet:  fish, squid, and krill                                           Penguins in Antarctica            Emperor Penguins (Webcast)                                                    Adélie Land (Terre Adélie), Ross Sea, Ross Island, and the Antarctic Peninsula                                        Cape Royds penguin webcam   David Ainley's Penguin Science Web site                                          Ross Sea Penguins         Studying how penguins respond to climate change in Antarctica                          Krill         Huge swarms of tiny drifters that feed polar ecosystems                          Ice         There's more to polar ice caps than just frozen water                          Climate Change         Many polar regions are experiencing global warming at twice the rate of other places on earth                           Antarctic Marine Ecosystem         The Antarctic food web is the simplest on the planet, and krill are at its hub.                                  by date:   January 2009    December 2008    November 2008    October 2008    September 2008    August 2008    July 2008    June 2008    May 2008    April 2008    March 2008    February 2008    January 2008    December 2007    November 2007            by type: video dispatches audio dispatches browse tags                                   Unless otherwise noted, this work is licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License .                             © 2009  Exploratorium       Links            Credits            Site Map            Entries       Comments

There are two subspecies -  A. p. patagonicus  and  A. p. halli ;  patagonicus  is found in the South Atlantic and  halli  elsewhere.   King penguins eat small  fish , mainly  lanternfish , and  squid  and rely less than most  Southern Ocean  predators on  krill  and other  crustaceans . On foraging trips they repeatedly dive to over 100 meters (350 feet), often over 200 meters (700 feet). This is far deeper than other penguins, other than their closest relative, the larger  Emperor penguin .   King Penguins breed on the  subantarctic islands  at the northern reaches of  Antarctica , as well as  Tierra del Fuego , South Georgia, and other temperate islands of the region. The total population is estimated to be 2.23 million pairs and is increasing.

[ 2 ]  Its specific epithet  patagonicus  derived from  Patagonia .   Together with the similarly coloured but larger  Emperor Penguin  ( A. forsteri ), it is one of two extant species in the genus  Aptenodytes .  Fossil  evidence of a third species Ridgen's Penguin  ( A. ridgeni )has been found in fossil records from the late  Pliocene , about three million years ago, in New Zealand. [ 3 ]  Studies of penguin behaviour and genetics have proposed that the genus  Aptenodytes  is  basal ; in other words, that it split off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species. [ 4 ]   Mitochondrial  and  nuclear   DNA  evidence suggests this split occurred around 40 million years ago. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Subspecies   The ornithologist  Gregory Mathews  proposed the two subspecies currently recognised in 1911: [ 6 ]     A. p. patagonicus  breeds on  South Georgia  and  Falkland Islands  in the South Atlantic. [ 7 ]       A. p. halli  breeds on the  Kerguelen ,  Crozet ,  Prince Edward ,  Heard , and  Macquarie  Islands. [ 7 ]       [ edit ]   Description   The King Penguin is the second largest species of  penguin  at about 90 cm (3 ft) tall and weighing 11 to 16 kg (24 to 35 lb), second only to the  Emperor Penguin . Like all penguin species, it has a streamlined body to minimise drag while swimming, and wings that have become stiff, flat flippers. [ 8 ]  There is little difference in plumage between the male and female, although the latter are slightly smaller. [ 7 ]  The upperparts are steel blue-grey, darkening to black on the head, sharply delineated from the pale underparts; the belly is white colouring to orange on the upper breast with bright orange ear patches. The 12-13 cm (4-5 in) black bill is long and slender, and curved downwards. The lower mandible bears a striking pink or orange-coloured mandibular plate. [ 7 ]   An immature bird will have yellow- rather than orange-tinged markings, and grey tips to its black brown feathers. It moults into adult plumage at after reaching two years of age. [ 9 ]   The chick is first covered with brown-grey down, before moulting into a thick, woolly brown coat borne until around 10-12 months of age. Their mandibular plates are black until the moult into immature plumage. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Adaptations to the environment   King penguins have adapted well to their extreme living conditions in the subantarctic. To keep warm, the penguins have four layers of feathering. The outer layer of  feathers  are oiled and waterproof, not unlike the feathering of a  duck . The inner three layers are  down feathers , very effective insulation. A chick is born without the oily outer layer, and therefore cannot fish until maturity.     [ edit ]   Drinking   Like most penguins, the King Penguin is able to drink salt water because of their  supraorbital gland  which filters excess salt from their blood stream by way of a capillary just above the penguin's eyes. The excess salt is then expelled through the penguin's nose in a salty  brine .     [ edit ]   Distribution and habitat          Great colony of king penguins on Salisbury Plain in  South Georgia       King Penguins breed on the  subantarctic islands  between 45 and 55 o S, at the northern reaches of  Antarctica , as well as  Tierra del Fuego , the  Falkland Islands , and other temperate islands of the region. The total population is estimated to be 2.23 million pairs and is increasing. [ 10 ]  The largest breeding populations are on Crozet Island, with around 455,000 pairs, 228,000 pairs on the Prince Edward Islands, 240,000 - 280,000 on the Kerguelen Islands and over 100, 000 on the South Georgia Islands. Macquarie Island has around 70,000 pairs. The non-breeding range is poorly known though presumably the subantarctic waters of the southern Indian, South Atlantic and Asian part of the Southern Ocean. Vagrant birds have been recorded from the Antarctic peninsula as well as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.   The Nature Protection Society released King Penguins in  Gjesvr  in  Finnmark , and  Rst  in  Lofoten  in northern Norway in August 1936. Birds were reported in the area several times in the 1940s though none have been seen since 1949. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Behavior           West Falkland       The American  physiologist  Gerry Kooyman revolutionized the study of penguin foraging behaviour in 1971 when he published his results from attaching automatic dive-recording devices to Emperor Penguins, [ 12 ]  and recording a dive of 235 meters (770 feet) by a King Penguin in 1982. [ 13 ]  The current maximum dive recorded exceeds 322 metres (1056 feet) at South Georgia, [ 14 ]  and a maximum time submerged of 9 minutes recorded at the Crozet Islands. [ 15 ]  The King Penguin dives to depths of 100-300 meters (350-1000 feet), spending around 5 minutes submerged, during daylight hours, and less than 30 meters (100 feet) at night. [ 16 ] [ 14 ]   The majority (around 88% in one study) of dives undertaken by King Penguins are flat-bottomed; that is, the penguin dives to a certain depth and remains there for a period of time hunting (roughly 50% of total dive time) before returning to the surface. They have been described as U-shaped or W-shaped, relating to the course of the dive. The bird dives in a V-shaped or 'spike' pattern in the remaining 12% of dives; that is the bird dives at an angle through the water column, reaches a certain depth and then returns to the surface. Other penguins dive in this latter foraging pattern in contrast. [ 16 ] [ 17 ]  Observations at Crozet Islands revealed most King Penguins were seen within 30 km (18 mi) of the colony. [ 18 ]  Using the average swimming speed, Kooyman estimated the distance travelled to foraging areas at 28 km (17 mi). [ 16 ]   Its average swimming speed is 6.510 km/h (46 mph). On shallower dives under 60 m (200 ft), it averages 2 km/h (1.25 mph) descending and ascending, while on deeper dives over 150 m (500 ft) deep, it averages 5 km/h (3 mph) in both directions. [ 19 ] [ 14 ]  On land, the King Penguin alternates between walking with a wobbling gait and tobogganingsliding over the ice on its belly, propelled by its feet and wing-like flippers. Like all penguins, it is flightless. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Feeding          A parent and a chick on  South Georgia Island       King penguins eat small  fish , and  squid  and rely less than most  Southern Ocean  predators on  krill  and other  crustaceans . Fish constitute 80-100% of the diet, except in winter months of July and August, when they make up only 30%. [ 14 ]   Lanternfish  are the main fish taken, principally the species  Electrona carlsbergi  and  Krefftichthys anderssoni , as well as  Protomyctophum tenisoni . Slender escolar ( Paradiplospinus gracilis ) of the  Gempylidae , and  Champsocephalus gunneri , is also consumed. Cephalopods consumed include those of the genus  Moroteuthis , the  hooked squid  species  Kondakovia longimana , the Sevenstar Flying Squid ( Martialia hyadesii ), young  Gonatus antarcticus  and  Onychoteuthis  species. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Predators   The King Penguin's predators include birds and aquatic mammals;  Skua  species ( Stercorarius  spp.) take small chicks and eggs, while the  Snowy Sheathbill  ( Chionis alba ) scavenges for dead chicks and unattended eggs. [ 20 ]  The  Leopard Seal  ( Hydrurga leptonyx ) takes adult birds at sea. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Courtship and breeding          Mating King Penguins at  Macquarie Island       The King Penguin is able to breed at three years of age, although only a very small minority (5% recorded at Crozet Islands) actually do then; the average age of first breeding is around 6 years. [ 22 ]  King Penguins are  serially monogamous . They have only one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 29%. [ 23 ]  The long breeding cycle may contribute to this low rate. [ 24 ]   The King Penguin has an unusually prolonged breeding cycle, taking some 14-16 months from laying to offspring fledging. [ 25 ]  Although pairs will attempt to breed annually, they are generally only successful one year in two, or two years in three in a triennial pattern on South Georgia. [ 21 ]  The reproductive cycle begins in September to November, as birds return to colonies for a prenuptial moult. Those that were unsuccessful in breeding the previous season will often arrive earlier. They then return to the sea for three weeks before coming ashore in November or December. [ 26 ]  The female penguin lays one pyriform (pear-shaped) white  egg  weighing 300  g  (T lb). [ 27 ]  It is initially soft, but hardens and darkens to a pale greenish colour. It measures around 10 x 7 cm (4 x 3 in). [ 27 ]  The egg is incubated for around 55 days with both birds sharing incubation in shifts of 6-18 days each. Hatching may take up to 2-3 days to complete, and chicks are born  semi-altricial and nidicolous . In other words, they have only a thin covering of down and are entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth. [ 28 ]  The young chick is brooded in what is called the  guard phase , spending its time balanced on its parents' feet and sheltered by its pouch. [ 28 ]  During this time, the parents alternate every 3-7 days, one incubating while the other forages. This period lasts for 30-40 days before the chicks form  crches , a group of many chicks together. A penguin can leave its chick at a crche while it fishes as a few adult penguins stay behind to look after them. Other varieties of penguins also practice this method of communal care for offspring.   By April the chicks are almost fully grown, but lose weight by fasting over the winter months, gaining it again during spring in September. Fledging then takes place in late spring/early summer.   King Penguins form huge breeding colonies - for example the colony on  South Georgia Island  at  Salisbury Plain  holds over 25,000 birds and the one at  St. Andrew's Bay  over 100,000 birds. Because of the long breeding cycle, colonies are continuously occupied.   The King Penguin feeds its chicks by eating a fish, digesting it slightly and regurgitating the food into the chick's mouth.   Because of their large size, King Penguin chicks take 14-16 months before they are ready to go to sea. This is markedly different from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King Penguins time their mating so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing. In this way, by the time the young penguins are finally mature enough to leave their parents, it is summer when food is plentiful and conditions are more favorable for the young to survive alone.     [ edit ]   Relationship with humans          at Edinburgh Zoo       Considered a  flagship species , 176 individuals were counted in captivity in North American Zoos and Aquaria in 1999. [ 29 ]  The species has been bred in captivity at SeaWorld in San Diego, and is exhibited at  SeaWorld  in  Orlando, Florida ,  Indianapolis Zoo , [ 30 ]   Detroit Zoo ,  Edinburgh Zoo  in Scotland,  Zurich Zoo  in Switzerland, and  63 Seaworld  in  Seoul ,  South Korea .   It is also the emblem of Edinburgh Zoo.   Roger Tory Peterson 's ornithological nickname was ""King Penguin"".

clueweb09-en0002-15-29520	"        Penguin Adaptation        Penguins are designed for life in the sea. Some species spend as much as 75% of their lives in the water. (They lay their eggs and to raise their chicks on land.) Heavy, solid bones act like a diver's weight belt, allowing them to stay underwater. Their wings, shaped like flippers, help them ""fly"" underwater at speeds up to 15 mph. A streamlined body, paddle-like feet, insulating blubber, and watertight feathers all add to their efficiency and comfort underwater. They also have a remarkable deep-diving ability.    In addition to blubber for insulating warmth, penguins have stiff, tightly packed feathers (up to 70 per sq. in.) that overlap to provide waterproofing. They coat their feathers with oil from a gland near the tail to increase impermeability. Black and white countershading makes them nearly invisible to predators from above and below.    Like most birds, penguins have little or no sense of smell (a boon for those in a crowded penguin rookery!) Like other birds, their sense of taste is also limited. Their vision appears to be better when they are underwater. Scientists suspect they may be nearsighted on land.    Penguins are considered to be the most social of birds. Rookeries may contain thousands of individuals. (As many as 24 million penguins visit the Antarctic continent!) Even at sea, they tend to swim and feed in groups.     Most species of penguins build nests, but the nests may consist only of a pile of rocks or scrapings or hollows in the dirt. Emperor penguins build no nests; they hold the egg on top of their feet under a loose fold of skin called the brood patch.    Make an animal suited for Antarctica.    1. Brainstorm ways in which penguins are well-adapted to cold water and icy environments.    2. Flying birds need a large wingspan to hold them in the air, but small wings work best for birds swimming through the water. Demonstrate this with two large sheets of paper. Try to push a sheet of paper through a pan of water. It doesn't push very well. Fold another large sheet of paper five or six times and try pushing that through the water. The smaller, stiffer paper, like a penguin's wing, works better.    3. Most birds have hollow bones to make their bodies light enough to become air-borne. But the penguins' heavy, solid bones help them float lower in the water. You can demonstrate the difference between hollow bones and solid bones with two toilet paper rolls, one empty the other stuffed with tissue paper.    4. Float an empty can in a bucket of water open end up. It floats high in the water like flying aquatic birds (ducks, for example). Add sand to another can until it sinks slightly. Now push down on both cans. The sand-filled container is easier to push down into the water. In this way, it is easier for a penguin to dive into the water.    5. As a group, make a Venn diagram to show the ways that penguins are different from and similar to other birds.     6. Have different groups of students make Venn diagrams showing how penguins are different from and similar to seals, whales, fish, and other birds.    7. Using ideas from the discussion about penguin adaptations and Venn diagrams, have groups of students design a totally new marine animal that is also well-adapted for the cold.    8. Make a picture of the animal.    9. Model it from playdough or clay and place it in a shoe box diorama.    10. Have students explain the rationale behind the design of their animals and habitats. Does it reflect earlier discussions?    11. Use a globe to show that all 17 species of penguins live south of the equator. Penguins live along the western and southern coasts of South America, the tip of Africa, southern Australia, New Zealand, and all around Antarctica. One species, the Galapagos penguin, lives on the equator in the path of the cold Peru Current. Seven kinds of penguins visit Antarctica, but only two species, the Adelie and Emperor penguins, breed exclusively on the Antarctic continent.     12. Penguins are the only birds that migrate by swimming.  Trace the migration routes of these Magellanic penguins on a chart of the globe. They may migrate to the west coast of South America to Tetas Point in northern Chile or up the east coast of South America, past Argentina as far north as Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Draw their routes on a map of South America and estimate the distance they have  traveled.     Using satellite images, match their routes with the location of cold water currents.    13. Research the route by which other species of penguins migrate. Use satellite images of the Southern Hemisphere and references on penquin migration to trace the migration routes of various species.    Discuss assumptions students can make about migration routes by looking at infrared imagery (penguins follow water currents).      The Great Auk    Research the Gulf of Maine's own ""penguins,"" the flightless Great Auks. These birds became extinct in 1844 when two museum collectors landed on a remote island off Iceland and strangled the last surviving pair for their collection and then smashed the last egg.    Learn how Great Auks were similar to penguins. Find out why they were slaughtered (for food, their feathers, and for stuffed specimens for natural history collections).    Whaling and penguins   Whale and seal hunting were factors motivating the exploration of Antarctica. The whales come to Antarctica to feed in the summer (just as they return to the Gulf of Maine to feed). The decline in the whale population because of whaling means that fewer whales are eating the krill in Antarctica.    Discuss the potential impact of the removal of a major predator from the ecosystem. With fewer whales, more krill is left for the penguins. Scientists think the recent increase in penguin populations may be a result of an increase in krill available to the penguins. Could this theory be proved or disproved?
