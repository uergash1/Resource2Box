Joints     from  Biomechanical Basis of Human Movement  by Joseph Hamill and Katheen M. Knutzen, Williams & Wilkins 1995, ISBN: 0-683-03863-X     Types of Diarthrodial Joints      Simple, Compound, and Complex Joints    The articulating surfaces found in the different joints in the body vary in size and shape. There is typically a concave surface on the adjacent bone, termed female and male surfaces, respectively. Also, there can be more than two contact points or articulating surfaces. A joint with only two articulating surfaces is termed a simple joint, while a joint with three or more articulating surfaces is known as a compound joint. A joint with more than two articulating surfaces and with a disc or fibrocartilage is called a complex joint. An example of a simple joint is the hip or the ankle (talotibial), of a compound joint is the wrist, and of a complex joint is the knee.    Close-Packed vs Loose-Packed Positions    As movement occurs through a range of motion, the actual contact area varies between the articulating surfaces.    The Plane or Gliding Joint    The first type of joint is the plane or gliding joint, found in the foot between the tarsals and in the hand among the carpals. Movement at this type of joint does not occur about an axis and is termed non-axial since it consists of two flat surfaces that slide over each other to allow movement. In the hand, for example, the carpals will slide over each other as the hand is moved to positions of flexion, extension, radial deviation, or ulnar deviation. Likewise, in the foot, the tarsals shift during pronation and supination, sliding over each other in the process.    The Hinge Joint    The hinge (ginglymus) joint allows movement in one plane (flexion, extension) and is termed uniaxial. Examples of the hunge joint in the body are the interphalangeal joints of the phalanges in the foot and hand, and the ulnohumeral articulation at the elbow.    The Pivot Joint    The pivot joint also allows movement in one plane (rotation; pronation, supination) and is uniaxial. Pivot joints are located at the superior and inferior radioulnar joint and the atlantoaxial articulation at the base of the skull.    The Condylar Joint    The condylar joint is a joint allowing primary movement in one plane flexion, extension) with small amounts of movement in another plane (rotation). It is found at the knee joint and the temporomandibular joint.    The Ellipsoid Joint    The ellipsoid joint allows movement in two planes (flexion, extension; abduction, adduction) and is biaxial. Examples of this joint can be found at the radiocarpal articulation at the wrist and the metacarpophalangeal articulation in the phalanges.    The Saddle Joint    The saddle joint only found at the carpometacarpal articulation of the thumb, allows two planes of motion (flexion, extension; abduction, adduction) with a small amount of rotation also allowed. It is similar to the ellipsoid joint in function.     The Ball-and-Socket Joint    The last type of diarthrodial joint, the ball-and-socket joint allows movement in three planes (flexion, extension; abduction, adduction; rotation) and is the most mobile of the diarthrodial joint. The hip and shoulder joints are example of ball-and-socket joints.       Other Types of Joints      Synarthrodial or Fibrous Joints    There are other articulations that are limited in movement characteristics but, nonetheless, play an important role in stabilization of the skeletal system. Some bones are held together by fibrous articulations, such as those found in the sutures of the skull. These articulations, referred to as synarthrodial, allow little or no movement to occur between the bones and hold the bones firmly together.     Amphiarthrodial or Cartilaginous Joints    There are also cartilaginous joint, called amphiarthodial, that are bones held together by either hyaline cartilage, such as is found at the epiphyseal plates , or by fibrocartilage, found at the pubic symphysis and the intervertebral articulations. The movement at these articulations is also very limited, although not to the degree of the synarthodial joints.

Type in your question and click  GO . See the  Tips  below for ways to get your question answered faster.   Step 1: This step is optional. If your question is similar to an existing question, you will be presented with several options. If one of these questions is an exact match, or you are interested in seeing that question page, click the question.        If this question is the same as your question, click  Yes, this is my question  and you'll be taken to that page. Your question will be automatically merged with the existing question.  If you're interested in this other question but it is not exactly the same as your question, you can click  No, but show me anyway  to open the question in a new tab or window.           Step 2:  Review your question wording, spelling, and capitalization.   Optional: If you are logged in, the question will be automatically added to your watchlist, and you will be alerted when it receives an answer or is edited. If you do not want to add it, uncheck the box.   Submit Question.    Categorize your question.   Click Save. You will automatically be taken to your question page to view your question.      Categorize your question:   You can place your question in up to three categories.  Place it in the most specific categories possible; what you see is not what you get! There are thousands of categories and three ways to choose the right ones for your question:      Search Categories : Start typing the name of the category you seek and a list will appear, narrowing as you spell out the category.    Suggested Categories : These are automatically suggested based on the wording and context of your question. You can choose to check these off or not, based on relevancy.   Browse Categories : Use the expandable category tree to find categories and subcategories that may be relevant.              Tips:   Use these tips to help your question get answered more quickly.     Ask your question in the form of a question; not a statement.

It's the sharing of knowledge and it's easy to do.   There are a few ways to answer a question or edit an existing answer. When you're on the question page, click on the links to  Answer  or  Improve Answer . If the question already has an answer, try to work your answer into the current answer. For editing tips, see this  Editing guide .    You may also add a headline by clicking  Style  on the editing toolbar above the answer box and selecting one of the headline styles. To save your changes, click  Post this Answer .      Writing Good Answers   Answering Policy   The Skinny on Signing Answers   Adding Links to Other Websites     Writing Good Answers   Answers should be to the point and should directly address the questions being asked. They should consist of complete sentences and extend beyond simple one-word answers such as ""yes"" and ""no."" When writing your answer, make sure to check for clarity, proper spelling and grammar, and limit the use of slang, abbreviations and instant messaging-type style. Here are some additional suggestions and pointers for writing good answers:     Avoid offensive language, insults, debates and personal references (where possible). Personal references include residential, business and cell phone numbers and addresses.   Advertisements and related spam  are not allowed within answers and will be removed immediately. Please limit commercial sales pitches and links to your  Bio Page  — which is your personal space on WikiAnswers. That is where we encourage the posting of your websites, logos, product information and so on.    Answering a question with a question is strongly discouraged. We've found that allowing follow-up questions turns question pages into discussion threads. Instead of asking a follow-up question, ask a new question — or use the discussion page to clarify/expand on the original question.     Answering Policy   An answer posted for more than a few questions could be subject to removal.  This indicates the answer is too general and should be customized to more specifically answer each individual question. If the questions are all asking the same thing, recommend that they be merged by a Supervisor.   Plagiarism is not acceptable on WikiAnswers. Please review the  Plagiarism Policy  to understand what is and isn't tolerated.   For Q&As seeking medical or legal information or advice, please do your best to be accurate. Our readers take these categories very seriously. While there are  disclaimers  regarding these categories, if you don't have the correct information, please don't attempt to answer or take these Q&As lightly.    The Skinny on Signing Answers   WikiAnswers is a Q&A community where answers are grown collaboratively. Unlike other Q&A sites, we are based on the wiki concept, which means that anyone from anywhere has the ability to edit and modify existing posts. There is no ownership of answers (unless the question is asking for opinions), so signing answers is discouraged.   What we are aiming for, where possible, is one really great answer for each question that is collaboratively created by the community over time. And, ideally, we want one answer with a neutral point of view.    Bottom line: feel free to delete any personal comments, notes and contact info from answers, including things like ""Hope this helps!""   Example of the wrong way:      Example of the right way:     Adding Links to Other Websites   To add a link to another website, click  Edit Links  located on the left. Links should only be to articles, sites, blog posts and information sources that directly answer the questions being asked. Please do not link to anything commercial unless it is directly related to answering a question.

clueweb09-en0000-96-21692	"                                 Piedmont Virginia Community College (PVCC) has established this site to allow students to advertise used books that they have for sale or exchange. Thus, the site is essentially an electronic version of a ""used books for sale"" bulletin board.  The site acts as a venue for students to advertise used books for sale and locate used books that are for sale. PVCC is not in any way involved in the posting of such ads or in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers. PVCC has no control over the quality, safety, or legality of the items being advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell their used textbooks, or the ability of buyers to pay for the items.                                                                      Quick Links       Quick Login                                               User Name          Password                                                                                                                                    Search and View PVCC's Used Book website                                                                       Search for a specific book  on PVCC's Used Book website.  This feature gives you access to all the books that are listed for sale on PVCC's Used Book website without being a registered user.  Please keep in mind that you must write down the contact information provided by the person that is selling the book so that you can get in touch with them.

My dream bedroom I like my bedroom because it is the place where I spend most of my time; I think that it is the best place at home. Let me tell you more about it. I have comfortable, small, square, light blue bedroom. There is a table next to my bed, and there is a dressing table in front of floral curtains. There is a small rug above a floral carpet. I have a stereo system beside my chair. However, if I had enough money, I would make some changes in my bedroom. I would put some spotlights, and I would put red curtains. And also I would buy a small TV and some funny pictures. If I wasn able to do all that, I think that my room is still the best and the way it doesn matter a lot as long as it is comfortable. ::. Dream school I like my school because it is the place where I spend great time. I think that it is the best place in the world. Let me tell you more about it. There is a big library in the administration building. There is also a big sports hall. There are a lot of toilets, classes, and computers. There is a big parking place for cars and there is a cafeteria. However, if we had enough money and the headmistress agree would make some changes in our school, we would build dancing classes, T.V room, swimming pool, a place to pray, sleeping room, and new bathrooms with showers. We would also put public phones, canceled the uniforms, and make the break time longer. If we weren able to do all that, I think that my school is still the best and the way it looks doesn matter. A lot as long as it is comfortable   :: Scientists think the first dinosaurs lived about 230 million years ago in the Triassic Period. Most dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period (about 65 million years ago), so that dinosaurs were around for nearly 165 million years!  The largest dinosaurs were over 100 feet (30 m) long and up to 50 feet (15 m) tall (like Argentinosaurus, Seismosaurus, Ultrasauros, Brachiosaurus, and Supersaurus). The smallest dinosaurs, like Compsognathus, were about the size of a chicken. Most dinosaurs were in-between. It is very difficult to figure out how the dinosaurs sounded, how they behaved, how they mated, what color they were, or even how to tell whether a fossil was male or female.A dinosaur can be named for the place where it was first found or because it has a unique body part say a crest on its head or a very long neck. The meat eaters (carnivores) ate other dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, eggs or small mammals. Most dinosaurs, though, were plant-eaters (herbivores) and ate pine needles, ferns, mosses, rushes and other plants. A few may have been omnivorous, that is they ate whatever they could find meat and plants. Dinosaurs probably didn't talk to each other the way humans do, but there were ways sounds, movement, skin colors and even the shapes of their heads or crests that dinosaurs could send messages like modern-day animals. Some adult dinosaurs lived pretty much on their own. Others lived their whole lives in herds. Many of the large plant-eating dinosaurs stayed together for protection or nested in groups to guard the eggs and feed the hatchlings. The dinosaurs went extinct about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period, which was a time of high volcanic and tectonic activity. There are a lot of theories why the extinction occurred. The most widely accepted theory is that an asteroid impact caused major climactic changes to which the dinosaurs couldn't adapt.  We must do something to save the wildlife; because it in dander. And we mean that the wildlife is animals and plants that live in natural conditions. People always kill the animals and destroys the area that have plants, and it the reason of what is the wildlife in danger                  Mar 9 2005, 08:24 PM           hiii if i had enough money i would change alot of things in my life and i would start with my house becouse there is no place such as home. firstly i would have my house on the clouds, in front of the house there would be a big garden with chocolate plants surrounded by a nice stable which has flyinghorses. in the middle of the garden , there would be a wounderful swimming pool with floating candles.  :inside the house, there would be a big mall with many facilities such as cinema screen in the hall,cofeeshops,restaurants and a playing zone. i wish this dream comes true and if it came true, you would be the first one to be so welcome to my dream house. with all my love s3doona     :               /div>    Mar 10 2005, 08:10 AM               30                      /div>    Mar 10 2005, 03:12 PM             ..          ے                   .

Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?                                            Login and Registration Issues                 Why cant I login?        There are several reasons why this could occur. First, ensure your username and password are correct. If they are, contact the board owner to make sure you havent been banned. It is also possible the website owner has a configuration error on their end, and they would need to fix it.        Top                         Why do I need to register at all?        You may not have to, it is up to the administrator of the board as to whether you need to register in order to post messages. However; registration will give you access to additional features not available to guest users such as definable avatar images, private messaging, emailing of fellow users, usergroup subscription, etc. It only takes a few moments to register so it is recommended you do so.        Top                         Why do I get logged off automatically?        If you do not check the  Log me in automatically  box when you login, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university computer lab, etc. If you do not see this checkbox, it means the board administrator has disabled this feature.        Top                         How do I prevent my username appearing in the online user listings?        Within your User Control Panel, under Board preferences, you will find the option  Hide your online status . Enable this option with  Yes  and you will only appear to the administrators, moderators and yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.        Top                         Ive lost my password!        Dont panic! While your password cannot be retrieved, it can easily be reset. Visit the login page and click  Ive forgotten my password . Follow the instructions and you should be able to log in again shortly.        Top                         I registered but cannot login!        First, check your username and password. If they are correct, then one of two things may have happened. If COPPA support is enabled and you specified being under 13 years old during registration, you will have to follow the instructions you received. Some boards will also require new registrations to be activated, either by yourself or by an administrator before you can logon; this information was present during registration. If you were sent an e-mail, follow the instructions. If you did not receive an e-mail, you may have provided an incorrect e-mail address or the e-mail may have been picked up by a spam filer. If you are sure the e-mail address you provided is correct, try contacting an administrator.        Top                         I registered in the past but cannot login any more?!        Attempt to locate the e-mail sent to you when you first registered, check your username and password and try again. It is possible an administrator has deactivated or deleted your account for some reason. Also, many boards periodically remove users who have not posted for a long time to reduce the size of the database. If this has happened, try registering again and being more involved in discussions.        Top                         What is COPPA?        COPPA, or the Child Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998, is a law in the United States requiring websites which can potentially collect information from minors under the age of 13 to have written parental consent or some other method of legal guardian acknowledgment, allowing the collection of personally identifiable information from a minor under the age of 13. If you are unsure if this applies to you as someone trying to register or to the website you are trying to register on, contact legal counsel for assistance. Please note that the phpBB Group cannot provide legal advice and is not a point of contact for legal concerns of any kind, except as outlined below.        Top                         Why cant I register?        It is possible the website owner has banned your IP address or disallowed the username you are attempting to register. The website owner could have also disabled registration to prevent new visitors from signing up. Contact a board administrator for assistance.        Top                         What does the Delete all board cookies do?        Delete all board cookies deletes the cookies created by phpBB which keep you authenticated and logged into the board. It also provides functions such as read tracking if they have been enabled by the board owner. If you are having login or logout problems, deleting board cookies may help.        Top                                        User Preferences and settings                 How do I change my settings?        If you are a registered user, all your settings are stored in the board database. To alter them, visit your User Control Panel; a link can usually be found at the top of board pages. This system will allow you to change all your settings and preferences.        Top                         The times are not correct!        It is possible the time displayed is from a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, visit your User Control Panel and change your timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. If you are not registered, this is a good time to do so.        Top                         I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!        If you are sure you have set the timezone and Summer Time/DST correctly and the time is still incorrect, then the time stored on the server clock is incorrect. Please notify an administrator to correct the problem.        Top                         My language is not in the list!        Either the administrator has not installed your language or nobody has translated this board into your language. Try asking the board administrator if they can install the language pack you need. If the language pack does not exist, feel free to create a new translation. More information can be found at the phpBB website (see link at the bottom of board pages).        Top                         How do I show an image below my username?        There are two images that may appear below a username when viewing posts. Depending on the used style, the first may be an image associated with your rank, generally in the form of stars, blocks or dots, indicating how many posts you have made or your status on the board. The second, usually a larger image, is known as an avatar and is generally unique or personal to each user. It is up to the board administrator to enable avatars and to choose the way in which avatars can be made available. If you are unable to use avatars, contact a board administrator and ask them for their reasons.        Top                         What is my rank and how do I change it?        Ranks, which appear below your username, indicate the number of posts you have made or identify certain users, e.g. moderators and administrators. In general, you cannot directly change the wording of any board ranks as they are set by the board administrator. Please do not abuse the board by posting unnecessarily just to increase your rank. Most boards will not tolerate this and the moderator or administrator will simply lower your post count.        Top                         When I click the e-mail link for a user it asks me to login?        Only registered users can send e-mail to other users via the built-in e-mail form, and only if the administrator has enabled this feature. This is to prevent malicious use of the e-mail system by anonymous users.        Top                                        Posting Issues                 How do I post a topic in a forum?        To post a new topic in a forum, click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. A list of your permissions in each forum is available at the bottom of the forum and topic screens. Example: You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc.        Top                         How do I edit or delete a post?        Unless you are a board administrator or moderator, you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post by clicking the edit button for the relevant post, sometimes for only a limited time after the post was made. If someone has already replied to the post, you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic which lists the number of times you edited it along with the date and time. This will only appear if someone has made a reply; it will not appear if a moderator or administrator edited the post, though they may leave a note as to why theyve edited the post at their own digression. Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.        Top                         How do I add a signature to my post?        To add a signature to a post you must first create one via your User Control Panel. Once created, you can check the  Attach a signature  box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio button in your profile. If you do so, you can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box within the posting form.        Top                         How do I create a poll?        When posting a new topic or editing the first post of a topic, click the Poll creation tab below the main posting form; if you cannot see this, you do not have appropriate permissions to create polls. Enter a title and at least two options in the appropriate fields, making sure each option is on a separate line in the textarea. You can also set the number of options users may select during voting under Options per user, a time limit in days for the poll (0 for infinite duration) and lastly the option to allow users to amend their votes.        Top                         Why cant I add more poll options?        The limit for poll options is set by the board administrator. If you feel you need to add more options to your poll then the allowed amount, contact the board administrator.        Top                         How do I edit or delete a poll?        As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator or an administrator. To edit a poll, click to edit the first post in the topic; this always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote, users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if members have already placed votes, only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it. This prevents the polls options from being changed mid-way through a poll.        Top                         Why cant I access a forum?        Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post or perform another action you may need special permissions. Contact a moderator or board administrator to grant you access.        Top                         Why cant I add attachments?        Attachment permissions are granted on a per forum, per group, or per user basis. The board administrator may not have allowed attachments to be added for the specific forum you are posting in, or perhaps only certain groups can post attachments. Contact the board administrator if you are unsure about why you are unable to add attachments.        Top                         Why did I receive a warning?        Each board administrator has their own set of rules for their site. If you have broken a rule, you may be issued a warning. Please note that this is the board administrators decision, and the phpBB Group has nothing to do with the warnings on the given site. Contact the board administrator if you are unsure about why you were issued a warning.        Top                         How can I report posts to a moderator?        If the board administrator has allowed it, you should see a button for reporting posts next to the post you wish to report. Clicking this will walk you through the steps necessary to report the post.        Top                         What is the Save button for in topic posting?        This allows you to save passages to be completed and submitted at a later date. To reload a saved passage, visit the User Control Panel.        Top                         Why does my post need to be approved?        The board administrator may have decided that posts in the forum you are posting to require review before submission. It is also possible that the administrator has placed you in a group of users whose posts require review before submission. Please contact the board administrator for further details.        Top                         How do I bump my topic?        By clicking the Bump topic link when you are viewing it, you can bump the topic to the top of the forum on the first page. However, if you do not see this, then topic bumping may be disabled or the time allowance between bumps has not yet been reached. It is also possible to bump the topic simply by replying to it, however, be sure to follow the board rules when doing so.        Top                                        Formatting and Topic Types                 What is BBCode?        BBCode is a special implementation of HTML, offering great formatting control on particular objects in a post. The use of BBCode is granted by the administrator, but it can also be disabled on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML, but tags are enclosed in square brackets [ and ] rather than < and >. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.        Top                         Can I use HTML?        No. It is not possible to post HTML on this board and have it rendered as HTML. Most formatting which can be carried out using HTML can be applied using BBCode instead.        Top                         What are Smilies?        Smilies, or Emoticons, are small images which can be used to express a feeling using a short code, e.g. :) denotes happy, while :( denotes sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen in the posting form. Try not to overuse smilies, however, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may edit them out or remove the post altogether. The board administrator may also have set a limit to the number of smilies you may use within a post.        Top                         Can I post images?        Yes, images can be shown in your posts. If the administrator has allowed attachments, you may be able to upload the image to the board. Otherwise, you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.example.com/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor images stored behind authentication mechanisms, e.g. hotmail or yahoo mailboxes, password protected sites, etc. To display the image use the BBCode [img] tag.        Top                         What are global announcements?        Global announcements contain important information and you should read them whenever possible. They will appear at the top of every forum and within your User Control Panel. Global announcement permissions are granted by the board administrator.        Top                         What are announcements?        Announcements often contain important information for the forum you are currently reading and you should read them whenever possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. As with global announcements, announcement permissions are granted by the board administrator.        Top                         What are sticky topics?        Sticky topics within the forum appear below announcements and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them whenever possible. As with announcements and global announcements, sticky topic permissions are granted by the board administrator.        Top                         What are locked topics?        Locked topics are topics where users can no longer reply and any poll it contained was automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons and were set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You may also be able to lock your own topics depending on the permissions you are granted by the board administrator.        Top                         What are topic icons?        Topic icons are author chosen images associated with posts to indicate their content. The ability to use topic icons depends on the permissions set by the board administrator.        Top                                        User Levels and Groups                 What are Administrators?        Administrators are members assigned with the highest level of control over the entire board. These members can control all facets of board operation, including setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc., dependent upon the board founder and what permissions he or she has given the other administrators. They may also have full moderator capabilities in all forums, depending on the settings put forth by the board founder.        Top                         What are Moderators?        Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) who look after the forums from day to day. They have the authority to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally, moderators are present to prevent users from going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.        Top                         What are usergroups?        Usergroups are groups of users that divide the community into manageable sections board administrators can work with. Each user can belong to several groups and each group can be assigned individual permissions. This provides an easy way for administrators to change permissions for many users at once, such as changing moderator permissions or granting users access to a private forum.        Top                         Where are the usergroups and how do I join one?        You can view all usergroups via the Usergroups link within your User Control Panel. If you would like to join one, proceed by clicking the appropriate button. Not all groups have open access, however. Some may require approval to join, some may be closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the group is open, you can join it by clicking the appropriate button. If a group requires approval to join you may request to join by clicking the appropriate button. The user group leader will need to approve your request and may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not harass a group leader if they reject your request; they will have their reasons.        Top                         How do I become a usergroup leader?        A usergroup leader is usually assigned when usergroups are initially created by a board administrator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup, your first point of contact should be an administrator; try sending a private message.        Top                         Why do some usergroups appear in a different colour?        It is possible for the board administrator to assign a colour to the members of a usergroup to make it easy to identify the members of this group.        Top                         What is a Default usergroup?        If you are a member of more than one usergroup, your default is used to determine which group colour and group rank should be shown for you by default. The board administrator may grant you permission to change your default usergroup via your User Control Panel.        Top                         What is The team link?        This page provides you with a list of board staff, including board administrators and moderators and other details such as the forums they moderate.        Top                                        Private Messaging                 I cannot send private messages!        There are three reasons for this; you are not registered and/or not logged on, the board administrator has disabled private messaging for the entire board, or the board administrator has prevented you from sending messages. Contact a board administrator for more information.        Top                         I keep getting unwanted private messages!        You can block a user from sending you private messages by using message rules within your User Control Panel. If you are receiving abusive private messages from a particular user, inform a board administrator; they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages.        Top                         I have received a spamming or abusive e-mail from someone on this board!        We are sorry to hear that. The e-mail form feature of this board includes safeguards to try and track users who send such posts, so e-mail the board administrator with a full copy of the e-mail you received. It is very important that this includes the headers that contain the details of the user that sent the e-mail. The board administrator can then take action.        Top                                        Friends and Foes                 What are my Friends and Foes lists?        You can use these lists to organise other members of the board. Members added to your friends list will be listed within your User Control Panel for quick access to see their online status and to send them private messages. Subject to template support, posts from these users may also be highlighted. If you add a user to your foes list, any posts they make will be hidden by default.        Top                         How can I add / remove users to my Friends or Foes list?        You can add users to your list in two ways. Within each users profile, there is a link to add them to either your Friend or Foe list. Alternatively, from your User Control Panel, you can directly add users by entering their member name. You may also remove users from your list using the same page.        Top                                        Searching the Forums                 How can I search a forum or forums?        Enter a search term in the search box located on the index, forum or topic pages. Advanced search can be accessed by clicking the Advance Search link which is available on all pages on the forum. How to access the search may depend on the style used.        Top                         Why does my search return no results?        Your search was probably too vague and included many common terms which are not indexed by phpBB3. Be more specific and use the options available within Advanced search.        Top                         Why does my search return a blank page!?        Your search returned too many results for the webserver to handle. Use Advanced search and be more specific in the terms used and forums that are to be searched.        Top                         How do I search for members?        Visit to the Members page and click the Find a member link.        Top                         How can I find my own posts and topics?        Your own posts can be retrieved either by clicking the Search users posts within the User Control Panel or via your own profile page. To search for your topics, use the Advanced search page and fill in the various options appropriately.        Top                                        Topic Subscriptions and Bookmarks                 What is the difference between bookmarking and subscribing?        Bookmarking in phpBB3 is much like bookmarking in your web browser. You arent alerted when theres an update, but you can come back to the topic later. Subscribing, however, will notify you when there is an update to the topic or forum on the board via your preferred method or methods.        Top                         How do I subscribe to specific forums or topics?        To subscribe to a specific forum, click the Subscribe forum link upon entering the forum. To subscribe to a topic, reply to the topic with the subscribe checkbox checked or click the Subscribe topic link within the topic itself.        Top                         How do I remove my subscriptions?        To remove your subscriptions, go to your User Control Panel and follow the links to your subscriptions.        Top                                        Attachments                 What attachments are allowed on this board?        Each board administrator can allow or disallow certain attachment types. If you are unsure what is allowed to be uploaded, contact the board administrator for assistance.        Top                         How do I find all my attachments?        To find your list of attachments that you have uploaded, go to your User Control Panel and follow the links to the attachments section.

Private Messaging          I cannot send private messages!          I keep getting unwanted private messages!         I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board!                phpBB 2 Issues         Who wrote this bulletin board?         Why isn't X feature available?         Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?                                                   Login and Registration Issues           Why can't I log in? Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.         TOP                     Why do I need to register at all?  You may not have to -- it is up to the administrator of the board as to whether you need to register in order to post messages. However, registration will give you access to additional features not available to guest users such as definable avatar images, private messaging, emailing to fellow users, usergroup subscription, etc. It only takes a few minutes to register so it is recommended you do so.tun. TOP                                    I've lost my password!  Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time. TOP                     I registered but cannot log in!  Firstly check your are entering the correct username and password. If they are okay then one of two things may have happened. If COPPA support is enabled and you clicked the I am under 13 years old link while registering then you will have to follow the instructions you received. If this is not the case then does your account need activating? Some boards will require all new registrations be activated, either by yourself or by the administrator before you can logon. When you registered it would have told you whether activation was required. If you were sent an email then follow the instructions, if you did not receive the email then are you sure your email address is valid? One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rouge users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid then try contacting the board administrator.          TOP                     I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!  The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions. TOP                            User Preferences and settings           How do I change my settings?  All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (generally shown at the top of pages but this may not be the case). This will allow you to change all your settings. TOP                     The times are not correct!  The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun! TOP                         Whate are: ICQ, AIM, MSN, YIM? ICQ, AIM, MSN and YIM are messengers with which you can chat and so on. TOP                       How do I show an image below my username?  There may be two images below a username when viewing posts. The first is an image associated with your rank; generally these take the form of stars or blocks indicating how many posts you have made or your status on the forums. Below this may be a larger image known as an avatar; this is generally unique or personal to each user. It is up to the board administrator to enable avatars and they have a choice over the way in which avatars can be made available. If you are unable to use avatars then this is the decision of the board admin and you should ask them their reasons (we're sure they'll be good!)         TOP                     Change Rang?! In general you cannot directly change the wording of any rank (ranks appear below your username in topics and on your profile depending on the style used). Most boards use ranks to indicate the number of posts you have made and to identify certain users. For example, moderators and administrators may have a special rank. Please do not abuse the board by posting unnecessarily just to increase your rank -- you will probably find the moderator or administrator will simply lower your post count.  TOP                     When I click the email link for a user it asks me to log in.  Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users. TOP                            Posting Issues           How do I post a topic in a forum? Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list) TOP                     How do I edit or delete a post?        Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post (sometimes for only a limited time after it was made) by clicking the edit button for the relevant post. If someone has already replied to the post, you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic that lists the number of times you edited it. This will only appear if no one has replied; it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (they should leave a message saying what they altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.         TOP                     How do I add a signature to my post? To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form. TOP                     How do I create a poll? Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administrator         TOP                     How do I edit or delete a poll?  As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a poll TOP                     Why can't I access a forum? Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them. TOP                     Why can't I vote in polls? Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights. TOP                            Formatting and Topic Types           What is BBCode?  BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.         TOP                     Can I use HTML?  That depends on whether the administrator allows you to; they have complete control over it. If you are allowed to use it, you will probably find only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people from abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. If HTML is enabled you can disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. TOP                     What are Smileys? Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether. TOP                     Can I post Images? Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed). TOP                         What are Announcements? Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Whether or not you can post an announcement depends on the permissions required, which are set by the administrator.  TOP                       What are Locked topics?  Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons. TOP                            User Levels and Groups           What are Administrators? Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums. TOP                       Whate are Moderatores? Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material. TOP                                Private Messaging           There are three reasons for this; you are not registered and/or not logged on, the board administrator has disabled private messaging for the entire board or the board administrator has prevented you from sending messages. If it is the later case you should try asking the administrator why. TOP                     I keep getting unwanted private messages!  In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now though if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone inform the board admin, they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.  TOP                     I have received a spamming or abusive email from someone on this board! We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try and track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received, it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action. TOP                            phpBB 2 Issues           Who wrote this bulletin board? This software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyright   phpBB Group . It is made available under the GNU General Public Licence and may be freely distributed, see link for more details TOP                     Why isn't X feature available? This software was written by and licensed through phpBB Group. If you believe a feature needs to be added then please visit the phpbb.com website and see what phpBB Group have to say. Please do not post feature requests to the board at phpbb.com, the Group uses sourceforge to handle tasking of new features. Please read through the forums and see what, if any, our position may already be for a feature and then follow the procedure given there. TOP                     Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board? You should contact the administrator of this board. If you cannot find who this you should first contact one of the forum moderators and ask them who you should in turn contact. If still get no response you should contact the owner of the domain (do a whois lookup) or, if this is running on a free service (e.g. yahoo, free.fr, f2s.com, etc.), the management or abuse department of that service. Please note that phpBB Group has absolutely no control and cannot in any way be held liable over how, where or by whom this board is used. It is absolutely pointless contacting phpBB Group in relation to any legal (cease and desist, liable, defamatory comment, etc.) matter not directly related to the phpbb.com website or the discrete software of phpBB itself. If you do email phpBB Group about any third party use of this software then you should expect a terse response or no response at all.

Most of the time, the only cost people consider is our attention — ads are designed to be distractive, they don’t let us concentrate on what we are doing. Jeff Atwood  analyzed  the space occupied by ads in comparison to content on a particular page and came to alarming results. I want to pick another page to look at the other aspects. Dilbert.com has been mentioned quite a few times as an example of an ad-laden site, the server response time is quite stable (good for reproducible results) and it features a large variety of different ads. If you look at the space distribution on the main page, ads occupy roughly 32% of the space while the content area is quite small with 22%. Most of the remaining space is navigation.     That’s the visual appearance. But let’s look at the networking side. How much do the ads cost in download size? How much do they increase page loading times? I measured these parameters for a full reload of the main page both with and without ads (each experiment was repeated 10 times to get a reasonably reliable average). However, when you browse a site, you usually make use of your browser’s cache — so I also did measurements for the case that you come back to the main page by clicking a link. Here is an overview of the results, all numbers are given in the “from – to (average)” form:                         with caching, with ads      with caching, without ads      without caching, with ads      without caching, without ads              amount of data transfered, kB       22 – 60 (40)        0 – 36 (11)        675 – 707 (680)        204 – 205 (205)               time required, seconds       2.6 – 5.4 (3.5)        0.0 – 1.2 (0.3)        6.2 – 8.4 (7.1)        6.0 – 8.1 (6.7)               number of servers contacted       6 – 8 (6.7)        0 – 1 (0.5)        8 – 9 (8.9)        1               number of URLs requested       12 – 13 (12.5)        0 – 1 (0.5)        72 – 77 (73.2)        55             Summary of the highlights:         Ads triple the amount of data one has to download (over 450 kB increase).     When downloading the page the first time (without caching) the delay due to ads is not notable. However, these measurements have been made with a very good internet connection, modem users will see something very different. Also, it doesn’t consider the time for server name resolution (all names were already cached) — resolving nine server names instead of just one usually makes a huge difference.     Dilbert.com is really good at caching, often you can go back to the main page without contacting any server at all. Unfortunately, ads pretty much destroy this advantage by requiring almost every ad server to be contacted. This means that instead of showing up almost immediately the pages take more than 3 seconds to load.        Now lets have a look at memory use. Restart Firefox, look at memory use, go to dilbert.com, check memory use increase. Comes out that this page needs less than 2 MB of memory without ads and around 9 MB with ads. Yes, we have quite an increase here.     Altogether dilbert.com includes 8 remote JavaScript files. They are allowed to execute on the page and access the same information that the page itself receives. What do they do, should you be concerned? Let’s look at those scripts in detail.     adsremote.scripps.com     Five of the eight JavaScript files included in the page are loaded from this domain. Three of them (ad types EXIT_POP and  SUPERSTITIAL  according to their addresses) do something weird: they insert an image wrapped within a regular ad link, but the image is a 1×1 transparent  GIF . Who is supposed to click on that? I have no idea.     The other two (ad types UNSIZED_AD and  LEADERBOARD ) are more creative — they load other scripts, this time from a.tribalfusion.com. What do these scripts do? You probably guessed it already — they load more scripts, this time from media.fastclick.net. And one of those finally inserts an image ad, while the other inserts yet another script (cdn.fastclick.net) that finally checks whether you have Flash installed and inserts a Flash ad if you do. The image ad (animated  GIF , 331 kB) is mostly responsible for the increase in download size.     All this craziness involving 10 scripts (have you been counting?) amounts to 31 document.write calls. Just to keep your browser busy. And of course each single script sets a cookie (altogether five cookies on three domains) so it can recognize you when you stumble upon another of their ads.     js.adsonar.com     This script defines a bunch of functions including its own error handler. Never noticed JavaScript errors on dilbert.com? That’s because the helpful ad script catches them all. The webmasters might not be very grateful once this masks a real problem but who cares…     It will add an unused hidden form to the page (memory is cheap, you know?) and then create the ad. The script lets the webmaster choose whether he wants a regular pop-up, a pop-under or an iframe. Dilbert.com chooses an iframe. In addition to the regular information about the account that should receive the payment it also transmits the full  URL  you have been viewing — just in case your firewall blocks the Referer header to protect your privacy.     The iframe actually contains an unobtrusive text ad, that’s the one you see above the text “Dilbert.com Marketplace”. It manipulates your status bar to make it appear that you will be sent directly to the advertised site. In reality it sends you there through redir.adsonar.com – each click is counted.     st.sageanalyst.net     That’s a tracker. It tries to get as much information about you as possible — whether you have cookies enabled, the address of the page you are viewing, the address of the page you came from, your screen resolution, JavaScript version supported by your browser. Then it creates an image that will transmit this data back to st.sageanalyst.net. And it sets a cookie to track you.     ssl.google-analytics.com     I probably don’t need to introduce this one. That’s Google’s visitor statistics service for webmasters who for some reason cannot afford proper log analysis. In terms of privacy there is only one difference to sageanalyst.net: instead of settings a cookie on their own server, Google sets the cookie on dilbert.com. I guess this has the advantage that one cannot easily block Google’s cookies without locking himself out of any cookie-dependent services on the domain (forums above all). On the other hand, this cookie is only useful for tracking the user within one site, on another site with Google Analytics you will receive a different cookie.

Matt Nordhoff (Peng)  · 2007-01-26 00:05 ·  #     I have a slow  ADSL  connection (but it’s still ten times faster than dial-up), and the main issue for me with ads is that  DNS  lookups will sometimes take 6-8 seconds, so page loads might get stuck for 10 seconds while some worthless ad script downloads.     7 MB larger memory increase, huh? That makes me want to Adblock the heck out of those advertising sites or get NoScript. I already block cookies from all domains except those that really need them (and my cookies.txt is now around 15-19 KiB, rather than 80 KiB), so I could do the same with scripts.        alta88 · 2007-01-26 16:10 ·  #     very interesting analysis.  noscript is your friend here, until content is so mixed with ads/scripting that it will be impossible to separate the two.     but – why not get dilbert via rss ;)        Reply from Wladimir Palant:    I am too lazy to run NoScript, I prefer the comfortable browsing. And Adblock already takes care of all the annoyances.           Fox · 2007-01-29 13:07 ·  #     I did try NoScript 2 times last year, and i think it’s not user friendly extension.  Sometimes i was not sure what i need to allow.  And also it did made me little paranoid too.     I use Adblock Plus to block all those annoying scripts and ads, and it works very well.  I like to use those options:  http://adblockplus.org/en/filters#options  Thank you.  My parents also enjoy annoying script and ad -free surfing, but i think they don’t know that Adblock Plus and my subscription does it.  I just make sure that that subscription works.
