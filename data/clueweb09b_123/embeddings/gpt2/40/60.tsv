FlyLady's Rubba Scrubba   One of the most frustrating things about taking care of our homes is when it seems as though you need a bunch of different cleaning brushes and products to do several things.  Recently we found this rubber brush and discovered how multi-purpose it really is.  Kelly went so crazy for it she insisted we had to carry it in the Fly Shop.  Here is how Kelly describes FlyLady's Rubba Scrubba!   I have dogs and kids, this means dog hair and crumbs every where, all the time.  I have been on a personal mission for years of just how to get the dog hair off the furniture.  (Yes, I know I should train them to not get on the couch but they are members of the family)  In my search I came across this rubber brush.  It wasn't that expensive so I figured I had nothing to lose but hair so I gave it a try.  I was so shocked!!  I had just vacuumed the couches earlier that day so I was not thinking that there was going to be too much to try but wanted to get the feel of how it worked.  I could not believe how much hair came off the couch that I could not see and given that I had just vacuumed.  I stood there with it in my hand and tried to figure out why it worked so well compared to all of the other things I had tried.  If you ever had long hair you will understand.  If you use a rubber band on your hair to make a pony tail, it is really painful because of how the rubber grabs and pulls the hair.  I was so thrilled, then as a joke I brushed one of the dogs with it and to my surprise the dog was so happy;  I was able to grab all the loose hair on him and it did not hurt him.  Over the next few days I realized the uses of the brush were endless.  I used it as a whisk broom with a dust pan, to scrub the tracks in a shower door, to go along the baseboards where carpet meets the wall, I even used it to wash dishes - even better - just toss it in the top rack of the dishwasher to sanitize it!!  I am telling you that this is hands down one of the neatest tools I have in my home now.  I can use ONE item to do so much! I have decluttered a bunch of sponges, scrubbing brushes and whisk broom  and have replaced it with this Rubba Scrubba! It is amazing! - Kelly   FlyLady's Rubba Scrubba is 10 1/2 inches in length and 1 1/2 inches wide across the brush head.

Following the instructions in this sewing project you            sew  bra without underwire . This kind of a bra can be nearly as            tight-fitting as a bra with underwire, but it is much easier to sew.            Furthermore, you do not need to get the underwires which might be difficult.           Patterns           The patterns for a bra without underwire can be drafted            with the measurements of the basic sloper and a couple of additional            measurements which are easy to take. For bra with underwire much more            measurements are needed and they are not always very easy to take.           If            you have PatternMaker Home or one of the other CAD versions of the program,            you can use the patterns just like you would use any other PatternMaker            patterns. You can alter them, join them to other PatternMaker patterns            etc. You could - for example - join the bra patterns to the patterns            of panties to get patterns for a bodysuit (more about this below).           You get the cups in two versions, horizontal and vertical            cut. You can later on make new cup designs using these basic patterns.            To read more about the cup designs, please refer to the  sewing            instructions page for lingerie  on this site.           Notions           As closures  you can in stead of the hook-and-eye            tape use zipper, buttons, Velcro or plastic closures sold for swimwear            bikini tops. The closures can be applied to the back or to the front            of the bra according to your wishes.            As            fabric  you can use normal lingerie tricot or jersey. I suggest you            use elastic fabric. Part of the cup can be sewn of stretchy lace or            lace fabric. You can apply decorations, such as a bow, flower or lace            appliqués. For ideas refer to the  sewing            projects  for camisole and panties on this site. To get a firm band,            the midriff part should always be sewn of double fabric.            Note!  To be able to sew a test garment, always             buy extra fabric . The notions can be detached from the test garment            and used for the final garment.           Furthermore you need  lingerie edge elastic . When            you buy it, check that it restores the original length after stretching            it. There are a lot of bad quality elastic available. Consider an alternative            to use elastic of contrasting color, that might be the only decoration            needed for your bra. You can also use normal narrow elastic and sew            it under the edge of the garment. If you use lace or lace fabric for            some parts of the bra, it usually is advisable to strengthen its edge            with transparent elastic (Framilon). Read more about edge elastics and            the techniques to attaching them in the  sewing            instructions  for lingerie on this site.           If you want to sew  padded bra  choose the horizontal            cutting option for the cup and sew the bottom half of the cup of double            fabric. You can the bottom of the cup or the entire cup and you can            add padding between the lining and the bra, if you want to. The simpliest            way of making padded bra is to cut the cups from padded fabric.                     Ready made band is sold for  shoulder straps.  You            can also make the shoulder straps yourself. For ideas and sewing techniques,            please refer to the  sewing            instructions  for lingerie on this site.            Hint : Using two spaghetti shoulder straps for            both sides of the bra may look nice. To get instructions of how to sew            spaghetti shoulder straps, please refer to the  sewing            project for camisole  and the  sewing            instructions  for lingerie on this site. You can also sew a fabric            tube and insert elastic into it. Stretch the elastic inside the tube            and topstitch the tube with 3 stitch or narrow, medium long zigzag e.g.            from the distance of the presser foot from both edges.            Always sew a test garment                       Sewing bra is much easier than you ever have thought. Nevertheless,            always sew a test garment first. It is necessary to check the fitting            of the patterns and the scaling factors used to reduce the patterns            in size. If you are not used to sew lingerie, sewing a test garment            also lets you exercise the sewing techniques.            If the test garment does not fit well, check which pattern            pieces have to be changed and how much. Be critical. The aim is to get            Very Good Bra Patterns for you to be used in many sewing projects. In            the picture to the left you see a test garment. Even if the bra feels            all right when worn by the subject and could be used as such, the fitting            is not optimal and the patterns need to be changed accordingly.           After having got good bra patterns for your figure you            will be able to sew luxurious bra with perfect fit in a couple of hours.            After you have learned the sewing techniques it may be worth while investing            in more expensive fabrics and laces. And once you have used bra sewn            to your own measurements, you never again want to wear anything else.            This is especially true with women who have a prominent bust and who            need extra support for it but find it difficult to get well-fitting            ready made bra.           Cutting           If you choose the horizontal cut option for the cups,            cut the  bottom pieces  so that the direction of stretch of the            fabric is  horizontal . Cut the top piece of the cup so that the            direction of stretch of the fabric is vertical. The top pieces of the            cups can also be cut from lace or lace fabric. If you make the entire            cup of lace, consider lining it with elastic gauze sold for this purpose            (e.g. under trade mark Spandex).                                           Cut the  midriff pieces in two copies  of elastic fabric.           Sewing           Sew the seams with narrow (1-1.5 mm), medium long (2-3 mm) zigzag or            serger. Trim seam allowances near stitches if necessary. Use 3 stitch            zigzag or narrow (1-1,5 mm), medium long (2-3 mm) zigzag to topstitch.           Always  machine baste  the seams first. After you see that the            seam is all right you can finish it with zigzag. It is almost impossible            to unravel zigzag neatly. You do not need to unravel the machine basting            stitches, they will break when you use the garment and wear away.                     Sew            the midriff pieces together at bottom edge ( picture 1A ) and at            front center top edge ( picture 1B ), right side against right            side. Turn the piece right side out and topstitch with 3-stitch zigzag            along these edges.            Sew dividing seam of cups ( picture 1C ) and topstitch.            Be careful not to stretch the seams when topstitching. Loosen the pressure            of the presser foot a bit if necessary.           If you apply  bones  to the bra band, sew casings            for them to the midriff piece according to markings on the patterns            - or to places where you want to have them. You can draw guiding lines            to the wrong side of the bra band with pencil ( picture 2A ). The            marks will vanish when the bra is washed for the first time.           You can buy webbed plastic with caps called  Rigilene             for the boning purpose ( picture 2B ).           The            boning must end 1/2"" to 3/4"" from each end of the finished            seams. ( picture 2C ). Topstitch Rigilene with 3 stitch zigzag            on the right side of the garment. Bartack at both ends to make sure            that the band does not move in the casing when the garment is worn.            The ends of Rigilene tape are very sharp and can break the fabric. Caps            are therefore recommended.           Finish top edges of cups with edge elastics from the CF end of the            cup dividing seam (if horizontal cutting) or from the mark in the pattern            (if vertical cutting) to the place where shoulder straps are fastened            (marked in the patterns) ( picture 3A ). For applying edge elastic            please refer to the  sewing            instructions  for lingerie on this site.           Fasten cups to midriff piece ( picture 3B ), matching notches            on cup seams to midriff piece. Stretch midriff piece when sewing. If            you want the seam to be very neat you can cover it with bias tape. If            you want to do that, sew the unfolded bias tape into the seam matching            raw edges, trim seam allowance, fold bias tape on top of the seam and            edgestitch along other edge (folded). Sew very carefully, the stitch            line must stay at same distance from and parallel to the cup seam ( picture            to the right ).           Finish bottom edges of back panels with edge elastics. Sew back panels            to cup/midriff part ( picture 3C ) and finish seam allowances with            bias tape if you want to.                                                       Finally, finish the top edges of the back panels (leaving the shoulder            straps between the elastic and the back panel) and the cups top edges            not yet finished with edge elastic ( picture 3D ). Leave excess            elastic at the cup corners.            Fasten  hook-and-eye tape  or other kind of closures to the ends            of the back panels ( picture 4 ). Put the bra on and check the            correct length of the shoulder straps by pinning them to their places            at the top edges of the cups. Fasten shoulder straps to the cups with            two horizontal stitch lines. Fold the excess elastic you left at the            cup corners under the shoulder straps.                                              Hint:  When you are sewing a test garment, sew the hook-and-eye            tape and the shoulder straps lightly to their places with normal sewing            machine stitches and use the bra for a couple of days. After you have            noticed that the bra feels comfortable, strengthen the fastening with            zigzag. If you find it necessary to change the length or the place of            the shoulder straps or the length of the bra band, you can still do            it easily. Hook-and-eye tape and ready made shoulder straps also are            too expensive to be thrown away with a useless test garment.                     Hint:  Shoulder straps may stretch in use and therefore I            recommend that you apply adjusting mechanism to the shoulder straps            ( picture 5 ). Look at your old bra to see how the mechanism is            applied to the shoulder strap. The easiest way to fasten the rings to            the cups is to fold the extra elastic left at the bra top edge to the            wrong side and put the ring in between. Fasten the elastic to the cup            with two horizontal stitch lines.           Other            ideas to use bra patterns           Lengthen the bra band to waist and join the patterns to            the patterns of panties. You'll get patterns for a  bodysuit .            If you do not have the pant patterns you can use the miniature patterns            included in the  panties'            sewing project  on this site or order them from me. Make a hook-and-eye            fastening construction at the crotch of the pants - that way you do            not need to undress the entire bodysuit when you pop in the ladies'            room.            Sew a waist length bra of e.g. denim and use it under a jacket as a            summer top. Or sew it of festive fabric and use it with a long or a            short evening skirt, maybe with a bolero.

Temperatures during the Winter range from 30-70 degrees. Temperatures in Summer range from 70-100 degrees. Currently I'm planting a garden and need the following types of plants. I want information on where I can order seeds for the plants I can describe, as well as pictures of the plants themselves.   The first type of plants I want are plants that do good in lots of water/soak up lots of water (essentially plants that can be used for drainage).  Have you ever seen brownstones in New York? They always have really cool vines growing on them that gives a sense of natural elegance. I'm looking for vines that are similar (though I know because I live in Houston they cannot be exactly the same) and that would be able to grow vertically onto a fence.  Plants that can grow with lots of shade, and constant blockage from Sun.

When shaded though, it will climb up and over adjacent shrubs and trees to heights of more than 20 ft (6.1 m) in its quest for sunlight.?  http://www.floridata.com/ref/G/gelsem.cfm    Star Jasmine     ?Star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides), a tender evergreen vine often grown as a groundcover, requires some shade in hot regions. Star jasmine produces perfumed pure-white star-shaped blooms in summer. Trim it with hedge shears after it flowers to keep plants low and bushy. Star jasmine is hardy to Zone 9.?  http://www.diynetwork.com/diy/pf_vines/article/0,2029,DIY_14174_2269765,00.html     Bower Vine    This site says Bower Vine requires sun, and grows 6 feet. I can tell you that the east wall of my house is covered with pink bower vines, and they are lovely. Part of my vines are in 95% shade, and part are in full sun. We ran some strings up to the roof and the vines grew along them; they had already grown up the stucco wall about 8 feet before we gave them something to hold onto. We then strung plastic garden netting over the north facing wall of our yard and the vines grew all over. I am in love with Bower vines.     The first year, they grew slowly, but after the second year, they grew faster, but not fast. They are not fast growing, but they bloom most of the year in my southwest home.  http://davesgarden.com/pf/go/1079/index.html      This site has information on Bower Vines that is more consistent with  my experience.  http://www.desert-tropicals.com/Plants/Bignoniaceae/Pandorea_jasminoides.html   Photos ://www.google.com/images?svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=bower+vine&btnG=Search      Creeping Fig Sun to partial shade Category: Vines and Climbers Height: 30-40 ft.

Keep plants' tips pinched back to encourage bushy, full growth. Impatiens, popular shade-loving annuals, can also help highlight dark areas of the garden.  At planting time Karen suggests adding blood meal and bone meal to the soil. Blood meal is a natural source of nitrogen, and bone meal provides phosphorous. After planting, mulch around plants with ground bark. Mulching helps reduce weed growth, retain soil moisture and give the garden an attractive finished look. Add a fountain to drown traffic noise, and you've created an oasis in the shade.?  http://www.diynetwork.com/diy/pf_vines/article/0,2029,DIY_14174_2269765,00.html     Coleus Mosaic Kong ?Unique pattern of bright green, shades of red and cream.

It was established in 1923 as a school for the members of the then Indian aristocracy. It is situated on a lush 160-acre (0.65 km 2 ) campus with majestic buildings. Children are schooled from pre-primary school through the 12th standard (age 3 to age 17). Instruction is provided on a wide range of subjects. The school is affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certification Examinations (ICSE, ISC). Its administrative body is the non profit organisation called as  Hyderabad Public School Society , which also runs  The Hyderabad Public School, Ramanthapur ,  The Hyderabad Public School, Kadapa .           Contents       1   History   2   Insignia and motto   3   Important buildings and halls   4   The school song   5   The house system   6   The Prefectorial System   7   The school uniform   8   Notable alumni   9   List of principals   10   External links               [ edit ]   History   The Institution was first established in 1923 in the erstwhile  Princely State of Hyderabad  due to the initiative of Mr. H. Wakefield under the  Nizam of Hyderabad  (the erstwhile royal family of Hyderabad) and was meant exclusively for the education of the sons of the  Jagirdars . Its first Principal, Mr. Shawcross, might be called the founder of the Jagirdar's College. It was the first residential school catering to the sons of the  Jagirdars  and  Zamindars  in those days.   After the abolition of the  Jagirdari / Zamindari  system in 1950, the Indian Government decided that the Jagirdar's College should be converted to an Independent Public School, thus throwing open its portals to all, irrespective of class or creed. The Jagirdar's College was reorganised in 1951 as The Hyderabad Public School and was affiliated as a member of the Indian Public Schools Conference (IPSC). In 1952, the Hyderabad Public School Society was formed with the Late Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, former President of India, as the first Chairman of the Society. Mr. John W. R. Kempe was appointed the first principal of the school. Till 1988, the school was an all boys school, and subsequently from 1989, it became a co-educational institution.   The school has grown immensely in strength since then and today, it has about 3000 boys and girls from diverse backgrounds on its rolls. It boasts an excellent library, well-equipped science and computer laboratories, art rooms, carpentry and book-binding workshops, a music room, and numerous sports facilities.   Since its inception in 1923, the school celebrated its Golden Jubilee in December 1973 and its Diamond Jubilee in December 1984. Its Platinum Jubilee was celebrated in 1999.     [ edit ]   Insignia and motto   During the Jagirdar's College Days, the flag had three colours; Dark Blue to signify  Oxford University , Light Blue to signify  Cambridge University  and the yellow band in the centre to signify the  House of Asaf Jah .   Today, the school flag is Dark Blue and Light Blue with a golden eagle at the centre with the school motto ""Be Vigilant"" emblazoned across the lower part in bold calligraphy.   The school emblem is the Shaheen (which literally mean 'Royal White Falcon'). The Shahenn was chosen by the then Principal Mr. Kempe for its sharpness of vision and its innate ability to soar to great heights. The main building of the school which houses the 'Turner Library' and 'The Shawcross Hall'is also called the 'Shaheen Block'. The Eagle has evolved as the local school emblem due to the large number of Eagles which inhabit the dense forest areas of the school.   The school motto is ""Be Vigilant"". These words exhort young students to be mentally and physically alert, to be discerning of life and the challenges it has to offer, and to demonstrate sharpness of vision and character to overcome them.     [ edit ]   Important buildings and halls   The Shaheen block, named after the school emblem, houses Shawcross Hall (the senior school assembly hall) and Turner Library one of the best libraries , both named after principals of the Jagirdar's College.   The Kuruvilla Jacob(Science) block houses the majority of the Senior school classrooms and science and computer laboratories.   The John Kempe block, named after the first principal of the Hyderabad Public School, houses most of the Primary school classrooms and the Primary school library.   The Purohit block, named after a former principal of the Hyderabad Public School, houses the remaining Primary school classrooms.   The Durand block, named after the second principal of the Jagirdar's College, houses Middle school classrooms.     [ edit ]   The school song   These words were exclusively composed and set to music by the staff members when Mr. A.S. Arnold-Brown was the Principal. Today, the School Song is sung every Monday morning at assembly.   It goes thus:   God, keep this school and all who herein dwell  Safe from all harm and evil's mighty spell  Teach us to live so one and all may be  Proud of this land and man's equality  God grant that we may live in liberty   Lead us along the path of good and right  Lead us to greatness always in thy sight  All in the school who grow from year to year  May know the truth that thou art always near  And give their best without regret or fear   So in the end this school may grow in fame  All who are here may loudly sing its name  And through the years and from each day to day  May we have cause to rise and proudly say  God bless this school and all who herein dwell     [ edit ]   The house system   The entire student body is divided into four houses named after renowned and ancient Indian universities and empires. Initially, they only had two houses, the  East  and  West  Wings but today there are four:     Nalanda  - The Blue house   Nagarjuna  - The Red House   Taxila  - The Green House   Vijaynagar  - The Yellow House       [ edit ]   The Prefectorial System   The Prefectorial System is a distinctive tradition of the school. A select body of students is invested (in a grand Investiture Ceremony which includes, among other festivities, a parade) with defined powers and privileges. The prefects serve to provide inspiration to the student body, and endeavour to lead it into realms of achievements.The heads of the student body are the Head Boy and the Head Girl. These students are chosen not only based on their academic and leadership skills, but also for their sense of integrity and honour. The Head Boy of The Hyderabad Public School is a highly regarded and coveted position in Hyderabad. Some of the note-worthy Headboys of HPS were Maulana Jannat Hussien (1979), Ishan John Chatterjee (1997) and Abhinav Ram Reddy (2007).     [ edit ]   The school uniform   Boys must wear  khaki  shirts with navy-blue shoulder-tabs with a stripe of their house colour across the tabs. Boys are required to wear khaki shorts till the ninth standard, and senior school boys must wear khaki  trousers  with their shirts tucked in and a black belt. The footwear consists of khaki socks and black shoes. Girls are required to wear cream-coloured blouses under olive-green  pinafores  with olive-green cloth belts and white socks in black school shoes. Prefects are given stars and/or extra stripes and badges (2 inch by 1/2 inch gold-coloured eagles) each depending on their duties and are thus accoladed. School Blazers (dark navy blue) and ties (dark blue with a white eagle insignia in the middle) are given to prefects. The blazers can be worn by any student (usually on special occasions). The boys' Physical Education/games uniform consists of a white t-shirt with the eagle insignia (printed where the left breast-pocket would be) and shorts in the official house colour. Girls wear plain white button-down shirts and skirts coloured in their official house colour.

Men and women equally enjoy playing casual games                November 21, 2007  in  General ,   Industry News  by  admin  |  No comments                                  Hi, thanks for dropping by. If you are interested in a lively community around mobile casual games why not register to play, score and make friends. Please go to http://www.playyoo.com/common/registration.html So, just who exactly is playing A Cat’s Life? Well, according to a  recent study  by the Casual Games Association, those who play “simpler games involving shiny gems or lines of colored balls” are equally split among the species — that’s 50-50. The report found that women buy more casual games, but men are just as likely to play them.         “Everyone always thought that casual games were something that only appeal to women,” said Jessica Tams, managing director of the association. “We knew these guys were playing these games, but the hardcore gamer who is playing Halo with his buddies isn’t going to brag that he just beat the next level of Zuma.”   Much to the dismay of machismo, interactive entertainment is unconditional. In other words, task a human with a compelling on-screen objective, and they’ll oblige.     Related posts       Why should I create games for Playyoo?

General sewing instructions for lingerie                                      Seams                    Sew the seams with                     medium zigzag stitch and medium stitch length.  The seams do not          need to be overlocked, if you do not want to, because lingerie jersey          does not ravel. If you own a                     serger  , sew seams with it.                                               Seam allowances                                           Important!       Please note that the                     miniature patterns include                      seam allowances  of 0,7cm (1/4""). Waist allowance is 4 cm (                     1.5""  ). These seam allowances are also in the patterns dowloaded          from this page as a PatternMaker file.                             When cutting the garment pieces add a 0.7 cm (1/4"")                     seam allowance  . After having sewn the seams trim them to their          half width.                                                                         Waist                    If you use                     stretch lace to finish the waist  of the panties, add to the waist          of the panties seam allowance equal to the width of the lace. If you use                     elastic to finish the waist  , add a seam allowance equal to double          width of the elastic + seam allowance. The best width for waist elastic          is 1.5-3 cm (1/2"" - 1"").                           Cut the                     crotch piece of the panties  in two, one from natural fiber fabric,          e.g. from cotton knit. It will be on the inside of the panties and feels          much better against your body than fabrics made of synthetic fibers.                                                                                         1.          Applying lace inserts                  Plan the placement of the lace inserts on the pants front. Experiment          the best position of lace motifs. If you use symmetrical lace inserts,          place also the motifs symmetrically. Tape lace in place and stitch along          edges through tape with narrow zigzag. Remove tape. Cut away fabric under          the lace.                                                  Note!       Because you are using stretchy fabric          to the panties also the laces have to be stretchy. That way the lace will          behave in the same way as the fabric when the panties are worn.                                                                                         2. Sewing the crotch                  Sandwich the front piece of the panties between the crotch pieces right          sides together and sew with narrow zigzag through the three fabric layers.          (                     Picture 1  ) Trim seam allowance close to stitches. Roll the front          and the back pieces of the panties inside the crotch pieces as in the          photos and sew the back seam of the crotch through all layers                                                                                                                          Trim          seam allowances and turn the crotch right side out.                          3. Basting elastics to the leg openings                                       Machine baste   the elastics to the                     wrong side  of the leg openings. Stretch the elastic lightly as          you sew. Special pressing feet can be bought for applying elastic to garments.                                                                                                          You'll soon learn, however, to stretch the elastic appropriately                     even without a special pressing foot.  The aim is not to stretch          the elastic too taut. The leg openings have been drafted according to          your measurements. Without an edge elastic the leg openings would, however,          flutter without control.                           Sew                     a                      couple of                      tests  to find out how much to stretch the elastic to get the desired          amount of gathering.                     Baste  the elastic close to edge to                     wrong side  of a piece of fabric. Turn the fabric and the elastic          once in and stitch on top of it on                     right side with 3-stitch zigzag  . Examine the amount of gathering.          In the photo to the left there is too much gathering in the first half          of the test                     (1)  , in the second half of the test                     (2)   the amount of the gathering is good. The need to stretch the          elastic depends of the stretchability of the elastic you are using.                                               Compare          the test result with ready-made lingerie and try to achieve a similar          result. But make the comparison only after you have sewn the 3-stitch          zigzag on the elastic on right side of the fabric and trimmed away the          excess seam allowance on wrong side of the fabric.                                                  Note!       It is important that the elastics          are                     equally long in both leg openings  . Therefore, after having basted          the elastic to the first leg opening, measure the length of the elastic          and cut an equally long elastic for the other leg opening.                                                                      An          alternative   is to cut two pieces of elastic long enough to feel good          when fitted around the subjects thigh at the place where the panties leg          opening will be and to pin the elastics to the leg openings with equal          intervals before basting them to their places.                                                                                  When sewing the sample garment I have used                     No Hands Elastic Wizard   which I have ordered from Clotilde's Web          Shop where it costs US$ 28. If you want to get there, please                       click          here                     .                                                                                4. Sewing side seams                  Sew the side seams of the panties and if needed, trim the seam allowances.                                 5. Finishing the leg openings                  Turn the seam allowances of the leg openings with elastics to the wrong          side of the garment and sew on top of the elastics on the right side with          3-stitch zigzag. Stretch lightly when sewing but don't pull. Trim away          the excess seam allowance on the wrong side of the garment.                                                                    You          do not need to remove the basting stitches from the leg openings. They          will break when you wear the panties and will vanish by themselves.                           6. Applying stretchy lace to the waist                   In the sample garment stretchy lace has been used to finish the waist.          Baste it right side up on right side of the garment waist. Match the scalloped          edge to the raw edge of the panties waist (you do remember that you have          cut to the panties waist a seam allowance corresponding to the width of          the stretchy lace).                                                                    Baste            along the inner edge of the lace around the waist. Overlap lace ends          leaving excess length. Stretch the lace when basting. Using narrow zigzag          stitch across the inner edge of the lace from right side through all layers.          Trim away excess allowance on the wrong side of the garment.                           Using narrow zigzag stitch through the overlapped layers of lace. Follow          motif if possible. Trim away excess lace from both sides of the garment.                                  If you use                     waist elastic  to finish the waist,                     baste  it to the wrong side of the waist. Match the top edge of          the elastic to the raw edge of the panties waist. Leave seam allowance          over. Stretch when basting.                     Fold   the elastic to the wrong side of the garment. Sew on the          right side of the garment through the inner edge of the elastic with                     3-stitch zigzag.

You have full access to all Fashion Freaks' patterns for personal use.          The patterns are available as pdf-files with pages in A4 size (210 x 297 mm). You will have to print the pages out and join them together to make a finished pattern.          Instructions on cutting and joining pattern papers.          In the pattern sheets there are markers for different sizes. To know which size to use you need to measure yourself and compare with the size sheets available. There is also instructions for how you make simple easy adaptations of the patterns.          Size sheets          Easy adaptations of patterns.         When you need two fabric pieces of a pattern piece the easiest way to cut these are by placing the pattern paper on double fabric enabling you to cut both pieces at the same time. Remember to check so you have the fabric turned so you get fabric pieces with correct  right side and wrong side.          Calculate how much fabric you need to buy         Pieces cut x 2 are often positioned like mirror-images in the clothing. This means that if you choose to cut these pattern pieces on single fabric (maybe you are short of fabric and this is the only solution) you will have to turn the fabric over before cutting the second piece. Take a front piece to a jacket as example. The two pieces have to be placed like a mirror-image on the jacket. If you cannot fold the fabric (right side against right side) and cut both at once, you need to fold either the patttern or the fabric over before cutting the second piece.          We recommend that you read all the instructions before starting the cutting and sewing. We also strongly recommend your to sew a test garment (in cheap fabric) of the pattern you have chosen, to enable you to see how the pattern fits you.

Vintage Clothing           Weddings           Weird Clothing                                      Many of you have Questions.  I Don't have all the Answers.          I get about 105 email a day, about       8 of which are questions from Manifesto fans.  I can answer only a very few of them.       Time spent answering individual questions sucks away the time spent on expanding     the Manifesto for everyone.   Many questions I don't have any good answer to     in any case.   I'm putting up this page to redirect questioners to places     where they can find answers more quickly, since even the rare questions I do answer are rarely     attended to swiftly.  I work full time at UAF teaching and costuming, and my spare     time is invariably taken up with maintaining and expanding the Manifesto.  I'm sorry     about this (being the ""Dear Abby"" of costuming was fun) but I feel it will be     best for everyone if I concentrate on the Manifesto instead of individual email.           Someone who  will  answer       serious costume inquires:                           Ask Ms Loper                   If you are a Jr. High or H.S. student who has       been told you have to ""interview"" a costume designer or fashion       designer for research on that career, please don't ask me for an       interview.  I get one of these inquires a week, all requiring I       answer a page or more of questions that require long, complicated answers       that suck time.  Everything I have to say on the topic I post here:  What Do You do as a Costume Designer for a Living?                  If these answers are not enough for       your report, there are also a host of online pages of similar interviews       with costume designers that you can mine for the rest of the information       you seek, all linked from the bottom of the  What Do You do as a Costume Designer for a Living?           Page.             There is also now an online         interview with me in                Literati Magazine                         From Brecht to Dada to Dumpster Diver Dor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You         can support my site by buying products offered by my affiliate sponsors:                               The Costume Book: The Non-Professional's Guide to Professional Results        Costume Construction       Costumes and Chemistry: A Comprehensive Guide to Materials and Applications                        For information about places where   you can study costume design go here,  USITT Survey of Costume Programs in the United States ,   also see the links on the  Costume   Shop Links Page .      People also want to know if I will make them a   costume, or have one for sale.  No, and no, but the people listed on the  Costumes   for sale and rent  page will either make one to order or have ones to sell   or rent.           You can also post a question (or     answer) to   my threaded discussion page where the Manifesto fans answer each other's         queries           There are also dozens of other  specialized         costume eGroups and message boards where you can post questions . If you often have questions, consider  joining a Costume e-list  in your area of focus.  You can then       get regular correspondence from others working on your types of costume.           My Advice and How-to links  lead to     the answers for many of you, both with pages of my answers and to outside pages that offer     helpful advice.

About  Neil Young :   Neil Percival Kenneth Robert Ragland Young (born November 12, 1945) is a  singer/songwriter who grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba. His work is characterized  by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and an almost instantly  recognizable nasal tenor voice. Although he accompanies himself on several  different instruments-including piano and harmonica-his style of hammer-on  acoustic guitar and often idiosyncratic soloing on electric guitar are the  lynchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished, yet consistently evocative  sonic ambience. In more recent years, Young has started to adopt elements from  newer styles of music, such as industrial and grunge, the latter of which was  profoundly influenced by his own style of playing.

""[Gordon] and his wife, Mary, began to craft an unusual church structure: Members had to commit to an inward journey of daily quiet prayer, meditation and courses on Christianity as well as an outward journey of social justice work. People would be held accountable by working in small groups. ""  Washington Post    That was 60 years ago. Gordon Cosby, now 91, just gave his last sermon at Church of the Saviour, Washington DC. Although the future of the church is uncertain [the  building  is for sale] the impact of this ministry has been  immeasurable . I visited this ministry in 1999 and heard Gordon preach a fantastic, heartfelt message on integrity and finances. It was in a coffee shop but there was no coffee, unfortunately. A bit mean not to serve coffee until afterwards, my gosh, i was staring at a cold coffee maker during the whole service . . .   but it was a real privilege to be there and hear the one and only Gordon Cosby.

I have read them all twice.        1. Surprised by Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church , by N.T. Wright.  I had a gut feeling it would be the best book of the and guess what?  . .  I was right as usual. Even  Scot McKnight agrees  with me. Eschatology was a big topic in 2008 and Wright puts forward some fresh thinking and a hard core challenge to take the resurrection of Christ seriously.    2. The Great Emergence, How Christianity is Changing and Why,  by Phyllis Tickle  Reviewed  here on the blog,  many months before it was released - I just couldn't wait. Great panoramic view of the last 4 decades and our current emergence from a publisher's point of view.    3. GloboChrist: The Great Commission Takes a Postmodern Turn , by Carl Raschke.  I  reviewed it here.  Carl Raschke points to where we are in this postmodern shift and explores our challenge in confronting a the challenges of globalization, the internet and ""Islamism"".    Runner Up  -  The New Conspirators  by Tom Sine which is one of the best books on the emerging church movement ever. Actually, it could easily be one of the top 3 books.

Chapter 7                     Church and Community or Community and Church? by Ronald Gleason   From the book  Reforming or Conforming?  Post-Conservative Evangelicals and the Emerging Church   This chapter by Ronald Gleason and Phil Johnson's chapter, were the best ones in the book for me so I am responding to them before the others, in case I dont get to the whole book. Both men have some history with the emerging church conversation and have done their homework. I have chatted to both by email in the past.   Ron Gleason sees evangelicalism sliding down a slippery slope over the past 4 decades, characterized by these landmarks:  1. A glaring lack of and disdain for the historical Christian tradition  2. A thirst and desire for ""tangible"" religion  3. A hunger for genuine community and relationship.

Chapter 9                     Joyriding on the Downgrade at Breakneck Speed: The Dark Side of Diversity, by Phil Johnson . From the book  Reforming or Conforming?  Post-Conservative Evangelicals and the Emerging Church   Phil Johnson has written the best chapter in the book and in fact should probably have written the introduction. If you buy the book, read this chapter first and it will add light to the whole conversation. He does well in setting the scene. He acknowledges blogs as well as books (Phil is an  accomplished blogger  himself and quite the digital artist) and he compliments the ECM on recognizing the mega-shift of postmodernity and ""sounding a wake-up call.""    He says ""the movement is a typically postmodern phenomenon - deliberately diverse, perplexingly amorphous and constantly in flux."" This diversity, claims Johnson, is driven by three motives:  1. The unwitting (or sometimes intentional) adoption of postmodern values  2. A gnawing doctrinal indifference as a radical reaction to fundamentalism  3. Self-defence. Individuals are free to assert or deny anything because ""Not everyone in the movement believes like that"". It is notoriously hard to pin down and criticize because there are always emerging church leaders who don't fit the mold. I can sympathize.

Post-Conservative Evangelicals and the Emerging Church    Paul Wells discusses the divine-human relationship to Scripture and offers four models - witness, accommodation, the analogy between Christ and the Bible [incarnational] and the servant form of Scripture. Treatment is given to scholars who's names begin with ""B"" - Bavinck, Brunner, Barth, Berkouwer, Barr and special treatment for Bloesch. I know what you're thinking . . . . Where the heck is BRIGGS? Well, Charles Briggs gets treatment in the book's  Introduction , along with Bave. Oh yeah - Clark Pinnock and Peter Enns also gain a mention from Wells also.    Key thought:  ""The doctrine of the humanity of Scripture cries out for a fresh approach that will liberate it from the self-destructiveness of modernism and postmodernism.""

Post-Conservative Evangelicals and the Emerging Church   Bonus:   MP3 with Gary Johnson  in which Gary talks about the book and what lies behind it and the emerging church movement that he calls ""a radical reversal of the reformation"".    Gary Johnson kicks this excellent book off with a quote from Carl Raschke on the church embracing 'postmodernity"" and immediately makes a connection with liberal theologician Friedrich Scheliermacher, Far too soon, I think. Raschke explains what he means by ""postmodernity"" in his later book "" Globochrist: The Great Commission takes a Postmodern Turn , 2008"". In this book, Raschke, who  shared a Belgian ale  with me last year in the Netherlands, and is a wonderful fellow, prefers the word 'globalization' as a worthy successor to 'postmodernism', pointing out that no one can refuse to be 'postmodern' in this sense of the word. I think Carl would add that dimension to this conversation if he could.    Technorati Tags:  reforming or conforming ,  reformed                      Continue reading ""Reforming or Conforming?

Really great time. Wolfgang spoke at the local church and we hosted visitors at our Orkney apartment.       Debbie got to hang out with Mercy, who is the daughter of a well known Indian evangelist. Mercy blogs at  While We Slept  and she wants people to blog about their dreams - thus the title of her blog.

Post-Conservative Evangelicals and the Emerging Church                    A really good book came in the mail two days ago.  Reforming or Conforming? Post-Conservative Evangelicals and the Emerging Church . I always said that when a book of a decent calibre comes out as a corrective to the emerging church, I would give it some airplay and consideration on the blog. Although I think it misses the mark at many points, its probably a better critique of the emerging church movement [or EmergentVillage, to be precise] than any other I have come across. Its well written, not condescending, not patronizing and it offers some good advice for the wider evangelical church.   And its Sunday today.  I have a bit of spare time and it might be a good way to spend it. No promises - I might not finish it today and I might not make it to the best 2 chapters in the book (Johnson and Gleason) but I will give it a shot and will add links below when there is something to post.

clueweb09-enwp00-99-16685	"                     Kiwi (shoe polish)          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Kiwi shoe polish )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          For other meanings of ""Kiwi"", see  Kiwi (disambiguation) .          The Kiwi logo       Kiwi  is the brand name of a  shoe polish , first made in  Australia  in 1906 and as of 2005 [update]  sold in almost 180 countries. Owned by the  Sara Lee Corporation  since 1984, it is the dominant shoe polish in some countries, including the  United Kingdom  and the  United States , where it has about two-thirds of the market.   This shoe polish was developed by  Australia -based  Scottish -born inventor  William Ramsay , who named it Kiwi as a homage to his wife, Annie Elizabeth Meek Ramsay, a  New Zealander , otherwise known as a  Kiwi . Its success in Australia expanded overseas when it was adopted by both the  British  and  American armies  in  World War I .           Contents       1   Development   2   Corporate history   3   References   4   External links               [ edit ]   Development   Whilst a number of older leather preserving products existed (including the Irish brand  Punch , which was first made in 1851, and the German brand,  Erdal , which went on sale in 1901), Kiwi's invention in 1906 made it the first shoe polish to resemble the modern varieties (aimed primarily at inducing shine). Scottish  expatriates  William Ramsay and Hamilton McKellan began making boot polish in a small factory in 1904 in  Melbourne ,  Australia . [1]  Their formula was new, and they worked on further improvements. Ramsay launched his product in 1906 and began marketing it in Melbourne. Ramsey loaded boxes of his boot polish on his horse and cart, and sold it to ranchers to protect their boots. [2]   Kiwi was a major improvement on previous brands. It preserved shoe leather, made it shine, and restored colour. By the time Kiwi Dark Tan was released in 1908, it incorporated agents that added suppleness and water resistance. Australian-made boot polish was then considered the world's best. Black and a range of colours became available, and exports to  Britain ,  continental Europe , and New Zealand began.   A rival brand of the time was  Cobra Boot Polish , based in  Sydney . Cobra was noted for a series of  cartoon  advertisements in  The Sydney Bulletin , starting in 1909, using a character called ""Chunder Loo of Akim Foo."" (The word  chunder , meaning ""to vomit"", possibly originated through the  rhyming slang  of  Chunder Loo  and  spew .) [3]   New Zealand is the only nation whose  colloquial identity  has been assisted by a brand of shoe polish. In the early years of the European settlement a variety of symbols  predominantly the  moa ,  silver fern ,  Southern Cross  and  kiwi   were used to represent the new nation, and even by the early 1900s there was no clear consensus. The spread of Kiwi shoe polish around the world enhanced the popular appeal of the Kiwi as New Zealand's national symbol.     [ edit ]   Corporate history          A can of Kiwi shoe polish       Over the years, Kiwi has been owned by a variety of  corporations . For the first six decades of its existence, it was part of iterations of an Australian corporation with Kiwi in its name, all based in the state of  Victoria , including Kiwi Boot Polish Co. (1913-1916) and Kiwi Polish Co. (1916-1971). The company then joined with Nicholas International Ltd, a Melbourne based pharmaceutical company producing international brands such as Aspro and Rennie. The new company was renamed Nicholas Kiwi. In 1984 it was acquired by American-based  Sara Lee  (at the time known as Consolidated Foods Corporation) who eventually sold off the Nicholas pharmaceutical products to Roche of Switzerland and kept the Kiwi range.   Kiwi was acquired by the American company  Sara Lee  following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark in 1987. [4]  The  Federal Trade Commission  ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 to prevent it from becoming a  monopoly .

clueweb09-enwp02-24-17183	"                     Kiwi (shoe polish)          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          For other meanings of ""Kiwi"", see  Kiwi (disambiguation) .          The Kiwi logo       Kiwi  is the brand name of a  shoe polish , first made in  Australia  in 1906 and as of 2005 [update]  sold in almost 180 countries. Owned by the  Sara Lee Corporation  since 1984, it is the dominant shoe polish in some countries, including the  United Kingdom  and the  United States , where it has about two-thirds of the market.   This shoe polish was developed by  Australia -based  Scottish -born inventor  William Ramsay , who named it Kiwi as a homage to his wife, Annie Elizabeth Meek Ramsay, a  New Zealander , otherwise known as a  Kiwi . Its success in Australia expanded overseas when it was adopted by both the  British  and  American armies  in  World War I .           Contents       1   Development   2   Corporate history   3   References   4   External links               [ edit ]   Development   Whilst a number of older leather preserving products existed (including the Irish brand  Punch , which was first made in 1851, and the German brand,  Erdal , which went on sale in 1901), Kiwi's invention in 1906 made it the first shoe polish to resemble the modern varieties (aimed primarily at inducing shine). Scottish  expatriates  William Ramsay and Hamilton McKellan began making boot polish in a small factory in 1904 in  Melbourne ,  Australia . [1]  Their formula was new, and they worked on further improvements. Ramsay launched his product in 1906 and began marketing it in Melbourne. Ramsey loaded boxes of his boot polish on his horse and cart, and sold it to ranchers to protect their boots. [2]   Kiwi was a major improvement on previous brands. It preserved shoe leather, made it shine, and restored colour. By the time Kiwi Dark Tan was released in 1908, it incorporated agents that added suppleness and water resistance. Australian-made boot polish was then considered the world's best. Black and a range of colours became available, and exports to  Britain ,  continental Europe , and New Zealand began.   A rival brand of the time was  Cobra Boot Polish , based in  Sydney . Cobra was noted for a series of  cartoon  advertisements in  The Sydney Bulletin , starting in 1909, using a character called ""Chunder Loo of Akim Foo."" (The word  chunder , meaning ""to vomit"", possibly originated through the  rhyming slang  of  Chunder Loo  and  spew .) [3]   New Zealand is the only nation whose  colloquial identity  has been assisted by a brand of shoe polish. In the early years of the European settlement a variety of symbols  predominantly the  moa ,  silver fern ,  Southern Cross  and  kiwi   were used to represent the new nation, and even by the early 1900s there was no clear consensus. The spread of Kiwi shoe polish around the world enhanced the popular appeal of the Kiwi as New Zealand's national symbol.     [ edit ]   Corporate history          A can of Kiwi shoe polish       Over the years, Kiwi has been owned by a variety of  corporations . For the first six decades of its existence, it was part of iterations of an Australian corporation with Kiwi in its name, all based in the state of  Victoria , including Kiwi Boot Polish Co. (1913-1916) and Kiwi Polish Co. (1916-1971). The company then joined with Nicholas International Ltd, a Melbourne based pharmaceutical company producing international brands such as Aspro and Rennie. The new company was renamed Nicholas Kiwi. In 1984 it was acquired by American-based  Sara Lee  (at the time known as Consolidated Foods Corporation) who eventually sold off the Nicholas pharmaceutical products to Roche of Switzerland and kept the Kiwi range.   Kiwi was acquired by the American company  Sara Lee  following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark in 1987. [4]  The  Federal Trade Commission  ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 to prevent it from becoming a  monopoly . Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior commission approval. [5]  The  Competition Commission  in the United Kingdom also investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry. [6]   Kiwi  remains the predominant shoe polish  brand  in most of the world, being sold in over 180 countries and holding a 53% market share worldwide. [7]  Today, it is manufactured in  Australia ,  Canada ,  France ,  India ,  Pakistan (owned by Muhammad Zamir Hasan Khan),  South Africa ,  Spain , the  United Kingdom , and the  United States . Other leading brands include  Shinola ,  Lincoln Shoe Polish ,  Meltonian , and  Cherry Blossom .

LG's slick new cell has a familiar face                        October 15, 2007—Our long national nightmare is finally over: The LG Prada phone is coming to the U.S. Sorry, just kidding, but the company's new Voyager model is the next best thing, with a similarly sleek form factor and an equally elegant touchscreen, a first for an American LG. (So is it the exact same screen as found on the Prada phone? LG's U.S. reps wouldn't say; we'll take that as a ""probably."") While the Voyager is heavier than its Italian cousin—4.7 ounces versus three—you get something useful for that extra heft: a foldout keyboard for texting and e-mailing the old-fashioned (and, yes, superior) way. (The Voyager's actually a sequel to LG's popular enV phone, which offered a similar approach, sans touchscreen.) What's under the hood isn't bad either, including Verizon's full suite of speedy V Cast options, a respectable 2.0 megapixel camera, and the VZ Navigator GPS service, which, as with certain other things, gives you a little vibration when you've reached the right spot.

The man and his faithful companion both returned home covered with burrs, the plant seed-sacs that cling to animal fur in order to travel to fertile new planting grounds. The man neglected his matted dog, and with a burning curiosity ran to his microscope and inspected one of the many burrs stuck to his pants. He saw all the small hooks that enabled the seed-bearing burr to cling so viciously to the tiny loops in the fabric of his pants. George de Mestral raised his head from the microscope and smiled thinking, ""I will design a unique, two-sided fastener, one side with stiff hooks like the burrs and the other side with soft loops like the fabric of my pants. I will call my invention 'velcro' a combination of the word velour and crochet. It will rival the  zipper  in its ability to fasten.""        Mestral's idea met with resistance and even laughter, but the inventor 'stuck' by his invention. Together with a weaver from a textile plant in France, Mestal perfected his hook and loop fastener. By trial and error, he realized that nylon when sewn under infrared light, formed tough hooks for the burr side of the fastener. This finished the design, patented in 1955. The inventor formed Velcro Industries to manufacture his invention. Mestral was selling over sixty million yards of Velcro per year. Today it is a multi-million dollar industry.        Not bad for an invention based on Mother Nature.                                              Velcro and Trademarks       Today you cannot buy velcro because VELCRO is the registered trademark for the Velcro Industries' product. You can purchase all of the VELCRO brand hook and loop fasteners you need. This illustrates a problem inventors often face. Names can become generic terms. Many words used frequently in everyday language were once trademarks, for example: escalator, thermos, cellophane and nylon. All were once trademarked names and only the trademark owners could use the name with a product. When names become generic terms, the U.S. Courts can deny exclusive rights to the trademark                                                               Subscribe to the  Newsletter       Name       Email                      artwork mary bellis               Related Articles Inventors Beginner Information for the Independent Inventor Alternative to a Zipper Closure or Close a Costume Gap - Costume Sewing Tip What Good Are Inventions?

CONCORD, N.H.  -- As the mother of a toddler who rockets from obsession to obsession -- goodbye astronauts, hello King Arthur! -- I can appreciate a dress-up costume that pulls double duty.   But why stop there, when a bit more effort yields a reversible cape able to transform him into at least four different personas? Here's a project with the potential to head off last-minute panic over a Halloween-morning change of heart and to spur imaginative play well beyond the holiday.    You can get as fancy as you want with the details, but the basic design calls for a two-sided cape with a button-on hood and embellishments that can be tailored to your child's interests. Try a superhero-king-pirate-monster combination for adventure seekers or a superhero-Red Riding Hood-princess-butterfly version for fairytale fans.    The following instructions will make a cape about 18 inches long that fits a 4-year-old, but they can be easily altered for a bigger child by using more fabric.       FOUR-IN-ONE CAPE INSTRUCTIONS    Materials:   1 yard red satin (or other color of choice).  1 yard black satin (or other).  Scrap of white faux fur, cut into 2 strips(2 by 17 inches).  9- by 12-inch sheets of felt.  Fusible webbing.  Hook-and-loop fastener (2-inches).  8 buttons  Thread, scissors, pencil, string, ruler   For embellishments:  1 yard green ribbon, 3 additional buttons, sewing machine capable of making button holes.      How to make the cape:    1)  Fold red satin edge to edge. Do the same with the black fabric, stack them on top of each other with the fold running vertically on the left. 2 1/2 inches from the top edge measure and mark: A) on the fold, B) 2 1/2 inches in from the fold, C) 5 inches in from the fold. Draw parallel lines from the top edge of the fabric to point B and to point C. Draw a perpendicular line from point C to the right-hand edge of the fabric.    2)  Tie a string to a pen and cut the string to a length equal to the width of your folded fabric. Hold or tape the end of the string at point A. Stretch the string taut and draw an arc radiating from point A. Repeat, this time shortening the string to 2 1/2 inches long.    3)  Pin the fabric together and cut along the marked lines. Unfolded, the fabric will resemble a half-circle with a small half-circle cut out of the middle and two tabs.    4)  Sew one hook-and-loop strip to the shiny side of one red neck tab, about 3/4 inches from the edge. Sew the other piece to the black tab on the opposite side.    5)  Pin red satin on the black, right sides together. Sew around the entire cape, using 1/2-inch seam allowance, leaving an opening at the bottom. Turn the cape right side out and slipstitch the opening.          How to make the hood:    1)  Make six button holes through both layers of the cape: one at each edge of the neck, one in the middle of the neckline, one at each corner of the cape and one in the center back of the cape. Hook-and-loop tape or snaps also could be used instead.    2)  Create a pattern on newspaper. Start with a rectangle roughly 12 inches tall and 10 inches wide. Starting at the upper left corner, draw a rounded shape that connects to the lower right corner.    3)  With fabric folded right sides together, cut two hood pieces out of black satin and two out of red satin.    4)  For a monster hood, cut triangles out of felt by cutting three 3-inch squares in half diagonally. Baste five of them to the shiny side of one black hood piece, lining up one side of each triangle with the curved edge of the satin.    5)  With right sides of black hood pieces together, sew along the curved side of the hood. Do the same for the red hood pieces.    6)  With right sides together, sew the black and red hoods together along the face opening and neck, leaving an opening for turning.    7)  Turn right side out and slipstitch the opening.    8)  Attach three buttons to the bottom inside edge of the red hood, using the buttonholes on the cape as a placement guide.      How to add embellishments:    1)  Use clip art or your own drawings to design emblems for the back of the cape, including a background layer slightly larger than the image that matches the color of the cape. For example, for a pirate cape, draw white skull-and-crossbones atop a black outline.    2)  Following the instructions on the fusible web, adhere layers of the craft felt together to make the design. Or, skip this step and the next one and simply glue the felt pieces together.    3)  Hand or machine stitch around the edge of the layers. Since felt won't fray, it's not necessary to cover the edge, but a satin stitch gives a more professional look.    4)  Attach a button to the back of the emblem.  5) For a king or queen embellishment, attach buttons to the back of the faux fur strips, using the buttonholes at the neckline and corners of the cape as a placement guide.    6)  For a butterfly, cut two pieces of ribbon 10 inches long. Sew two short ends of each ribbon to each other, creating a loop, and attach a button near the seam. Repeat for other ribbon. These loops can then be buttoned onto the corners of the cape and to make wrist straps that allow the child to ""flap its wings.""    Cut another piece of ribbon approximately 12 inches long and again sew the short ends together. Attach a button near the seam. This loop can be slipped over one side of the cape and buttoned to the center neckline buttonhole. Arrange the ribbon so that it gathers up the back of the cape in the center back, creating two ""wings"" that drape down on either side.

I went by the measurements your company had for a small. It did not indicate numeric sizes. My grandson is six. I ordered the small and when I received it , it was a 4-6. He is a 7. It just did fit. was really too small ,but he wore it .I had never ordered from your company before. The quality was good. You just need to specify more clearly on sizing.
