My name is Sheri/MorningStar, the organizer. It's great to meet you, in a virtual kind of way - I look forward to meeting you in person! This group is open to anyone interested in Wicca or WitchCraft. We are dedicated to providing intelligent content and discussion, to help out the beginning witch and lend support to the practiced witch. Come be a part of a Learning Fellowship, where we all have something to share and something to learn!    We offer socials, Full Moon circles, Sabbat rituals, and classes. The same group runs the Seattle and the Bellevue/Eastside Witches Meetups, FYI, and I will typically cross-post the same event on both websites, though the socials for each group are separate. Come hang out and just get to know us! We're a friendly fun group, absolutely no politics or melodrama.    There are lots of other Pagan/Wiccan groups and events in Seattle also! Check out  http://groups.yahoo.com/spevents/  for a list of local events. There is a Wiccan newsletter called Widdershins you can see at www.widdershins.org that has a list of local resources as well. Feel free to ping me with questions.

MetroBellevue is the winning bidder of the bowling pin         titled ""Fetish Facere"" by artist Esther Ervin.         Details about the artist and pin.                    Artist :          Esther Ervin           Artist Comments : Since the         peculiar contours of a bowling pin seem reminiscent         of ancient fetish figures, I decided to create a         modern fetish, constructed from art-paper, twine,         beads, hammered copper, wool and other materials.           About this Artist : Esther Ervin         began creating sculpture from gourds and wood when         work-for-hire was not engaging enough. These works         enabled her to earn an Artist in Residency and the         Pathways Scholarship at Pratt Fine Arts Center,         where she has learned to work with various metals.         Her aesthetic is grounded in the use of multiple         media, and the employment of artisans' processes to         produce Fine Art.

We placed bids on several ceramic masks and was        lucky to come away a winner of this beautiful mask by        artist Randy Yamanaka, a blood donor and police officer.                Details about the artist and mask.                                 Artist : Randy Yamanaka           Artist Comments : I support the Puget Sound Blood Center          because they are life-givers, everyday heroes, and I've          seen it first-hand as a marrow donor.           About this Mask : The ""Bird-Woman"" was a vision through          the eyes of my daughter and her love for birds. It was          also inspired by her stuffed toys, which came to life on          this palette. To be honest, I'm a career police officer          and most of my training is in crime scene sketches. But          this project offered me a unique opportunity to create          something far more fun!

This website asserts the natural right of people everywhere to pursue their lives, interests and pleasures free from harmful social conditioning, from exploitation and domination by covert political and economic forces which seek to enslave them and from repressive authoritarian governments, rapacious capitalist corporations, mendacious religious organizations, fraudulent international bankers and the unholy alliance among all of these which works to deprive the common people of all countries of their freedom, health, happiness and the full realization of their spiritual potential.   Also this site may help to inform those people who previously preferred to ""look the other way"" and not see what is going on around them and in other societies and — not seeing — saying and doing nothing, thereby helping evil to flourish and harming themselves and everyone else on this planet.  When someone next offers you disinfo, lies and deceit  Just Say 'Know' .

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That  whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,  and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  — Thomas Jefferson,  American Declaration of Independence        WE HOLD THIS TRUTH  THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE CREATED DIFFERENT.  That every human being has the right to be mentally free and independent.  That every human being has the right to feel, see, hear, sense, imagine, believe or experience anything at all, in any way, at any time.  That every human being has the right to behave in any way that does not harm others or break fair and just laws.  That no human being shall be subjected without consent to incarceration, restraint, punishment or psychological or medical intervention in an attempt to control, repress or alter the individual's thoughts, feelings or experiences.  — UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF MENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS     Samuel Adams (American revolutionary):    If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude than the animating contest of freedom, go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains sit lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen!    James Madison (Fourth President of the United States):    Knowledge will forever govern ignorance, and a people who mean to be their own governors, must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives. A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy or perhaps both.       Percy Bysshe Shelley  (Queen Mab) :                                               The man   Of virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys.   Power, like a desolating pestilence,   Pollutes whate'er it touches; and obedience,   Bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth,   Makes slaves of men, and, of the human frame,   A mechanized automaton.    John Stuart Mill  (Essay on Liberty) :    [T]he sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. ... [T]he only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.     Bertrand Russell  (Principles of Social Reconstruction) :     Men fear thought more than they fear anything else on earth — more than ruin, more even than death. Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible; thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habits; thought is anarchic and lawless, indifferent to authority, careless of the well-tried wisdom of the ages ...   But if thought is to become the possession of many, not the privilege of the few, we must have done with fear. It is fear that holds men back — fear lest their cherished beliefs should prove delusions, fear lest the institutions by which they live should prove harmful, fear lest they themselves should prove less worthy of respect than they have supposed themselves to be.   T. S. Eliot: ( Burnt Norton ):     ... human kind cannot bear very much reality.       Mahatma Gandhi:    You assist an evil system most effectively by obeying its orders and decrees. An evil system never deserves such allegiance. Allegiance to it means partaking of the evil. A good person will resist an evil system with his or her whole soul.   Bob Dylan:    I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Farm no more ...   George Orwell:     During times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act.   Dr Martin Luther King:    Let freedom ring!     Aldous Huxley:  (Brave New World Revisited) :    Big Government and Big Business ... will try to impose social and cultural uniformity upon adults and their children.  To achieve this they will (unless prevented) make use of all the mind-manipulating techniques at their disposal and will not hesitate to reinforce these methods of non-rational persuasion by economic coercion and threats of physical violence.  If this kind of tyranny is to be avoided, we must begin without delay to educate ourselves and our children for freedom and self-government.  Such an education for freedom should be ... first of all in facts and in values — the facts of individual diversity and genetic uniqueness and the values of freedom, tolerance and mutual charity, which are the ethical corollaries of these facts.     Bob Marley  (Redemption Song) :    Emancipate yourself from mental slavery,  None but ourselves can free our minds ...     Wade Frazier:     All those institutions that we have given our power away to — corporations, governments, churches, etc. — have largely enslaved us with our own power. The only path to true freedom is by reclaiming our power, responsibility and sovereignty, and doing it lovingly.   Gore Vidal:    'Conspiracy stuff' is now shorthand for unspeakable truth.   Leuren Moret:    The legacy of the weapons proliferators, drug traffickers, sex traffickers, and gambling promoters of yesterday ... continues to enrich the same families. It is a culture of death and destruction which is turning Planet Earth into a death star. ... The United States has become a fascist state where there is no clear distinction between legitimate and clandestine illegal organisations.   Margaret Atwood:     When things are really dismal, you can laugh or you can cave in completely. ... If you can laugh, you're still alive. You haven't given up yet.   Citizen Spook:    Once the American people understand that they have been robbed blind and that the money they thought was being used to run the government is actually being funneled, in a manner that would make Enron's frauds seem paltry, to the vaults of a few private banking institutions, the people will wake up and join the million man petition for a redress of grievances. The power is with the people, but unless the people use that power it remains dormant. We haven't awoken enough people to their proactive power as the respiratory system of the Constitution and the government. In order to make the government submissive to the will of the people, the people must be educated.   Terence McKenna:     Nature loves courage ... and rewards it with success.

Slow Food Nation organizes events to introduce the community to issues in the food system and the need to bring more citizens good, clean and fair food.  Learn and experience how to build community through the promotion of sustainable and holistic food systems in which aspects of human culture such as music, art, and dance are integrated with the agricultural arts of food production, the environment and human wellness and culture.    A slate of programming at YBCA with Slow Food Nation will be announced later this year.

On Valentine's Day, you may want to write a humorous poem, (one that feels light and sweet) in order to find out whether she has feelings for you. In this way you won't get hurt if she's not interested and you've shown that are interested if she is. This is a safe way to make your feelings known without getting hurt.

A short poem to your Valentine can easily be more powerful than a long one. It is the content that matters. In fact, if you're taking the time to write something of your own, you're probably on the right track. Don't go for the ""roses are red, violets are blue"" variety of poems. Don't give her a card with a prewritten poem in it. That won't get you anywhere. True romance are words from your heart to hers.

You're probably asking yourself if your boyfriend cares for you as much as you care for him. Well here's something you should know about guys. They're not the best at sharing their feelings. They may need a little poking and prodding. Don't look at this as a sign that they don't care. They need your help. Show him how to be a good lover. Be clear about what you want, he's probably more scared than you.

Where would you be without your girlfriend? Have you ever tried sharing feelings with your buddies? They just don't get it, and they would laugh at you anyway. Be thankful that you have someone that you can be vulnerable with. Having a woman in your life is the ultimate gift. Your bodies fit together because your souls fit together and you're meant to be together. Say thank you to your girlfriend. Tell her how grateful you are that she is in your life.

Well, I've got news for you. He's probably thinking the same abut you. It is said that familiarity breeds contempt. Hopefully you don hold your husband in contempt, but it's definitely not like it used to be. If you want your husband to sit up and take notice, do something unusual this Valentine's Day. The longer that you've been married, the crazier it has to be.

This holiday probably means more to your wife than it does to you. Do yourself a favor and show her that you really care. It will be worth your while, guaranteed. You may think that your wife knows that you love her. You may think that she knows you appreciate her. But how should she know? Think about it, when was the last time you took her in your arms, looked into her eyes and shared your deepest feelings? Now is the time!

This day is set aside to celebrate love. There's love and romance in the air. Everywhere you go there's chocolate and candy. If you don't have someone to share your love with, this may be a day to stay in bed. Or it may be a to call that girl that you have been thinking about calling for a long time. If you're miserable about not being in relationship, get out of bed, pick up the phone, and do something about it.

All through your life you meet plenty of people. Some stay and         some leave. But true friends leave their footprints in your heart. With         friends around, life can be fun. After all, they are there all through         our highs and lows. People who share your happiness but vanish when you         are sad are not worth being friends. As an ode to your everlasting         friendship, we bring you poems on friendship. Write down a poem for your         friend and see the person smile like never before! For ideas, you can         always check our related sections that offer poems for different types         of poems.                       Broken Friendship Poem           The pain of going through a broken friendship is unbearable. The world         seems to be coming to an end and you seem completely helpless with no         one to turn to. When a friendship breaks, it really hurts.

clueweb09-en0011-97-35101	        Greetings and Introductions                                  This article covers some of the basic greetings and introductions you can expect to use or see others use when you begin learning sign language. Because there are so many different sign languages this article will concentrate on British sign language. It may be that some of the more generic signs are the same as in other sign languages but just as spoken languages do, sign languages borrow signs from other languages and modify them for themselves.    The basic greetings and introductions will, most likely, be the first thing you are taught in class. This is in common with most spoken languages, at least making it possible for you to pass the time of day with a sign language user.    Saying Hello and Goodbye  Most people use these signs even if they dont know any sign language  without even realising it. That is because the signs for hello and goodbye are waves. Hello is a wave from right to left while goodbye is a wave with the hand folding up and down. And of course, these signs are recognised by people who do not know sign language as well, making the very basic introductions between people everywhere very simple  regardless of their language abilities.                      More Detailed Greetings  So, you will want to move on immediately to more detailed greetings, perhaps something that will allow you to find out how the other person is. These too are kept fairly simple, again, making these words the ideal way for beginners to start. To say how are you, you simply touch your chest with open hands and then move your hands away from you and bring your fingers in  a simple and quick sign. To respond, you could say fed up which is the top of your hand touching your chin, or good which is very self-explanatory, as it is a thumbs up sign. Other simple words which you may need to learn are yes and no, which, much like the waves, are commonly used anyway  a nod for yes and a head shake for no, with extra emphasis for effect as desired.    Names  Most names will have to be finger spelt as there are not individual signs for most names. But you will still need to be able to ask someone their name, and understand when they are asking you. The word 'name' is the first and second fingers held near the top of the head and then moved away in an arc. Then the response can be the spelling out of your name.   These basic steps will allow you to make at least the most rudimentary introductions when you meet someone who uses sign language. You will not be able to go much further but at least it is a start. It will enable you to check the other person is ok and find out their name. And much else can be conveyed through expression and simple gestures if you get stuck. And once these basics are mastered you will feel confident enough to try and learn more complex signs and the structure of the language.                                    Stumble It!

SOYOUWANNA BE A PARALEGAL?                                                    1. Make Sure You Really Want The Job 2. Decide Where To Apply  3. Submit A Cover Letter And Resume 4. Don't Blow The Interview                                       So you're finishing college and your life plans don't extend much beyond dinner. Join the club. If you wanna kill some time before applying to grad school or just make enough money to avoid moving in with your parents, you should consider working as a paralegal for a few years, because if you have a college degree and decent grades, you're qualified to be an entry-level paralegal. Don't I need a paralegal certificate? Some paralegal positions require a paralegal certificate, a diploma you get after taking an accredited course in paralegal studies. But these certificates, and the positions that require them, are mostly for people who wish to be career paralegals. So don't fear -- there are plenty of positions available for recent college grads that don't require a paralegal certificate. And we're going to tell you how to get  those  jobs. (If you wish to be a career paralegal, check out  American Bar Association  for more info.)                     1. MAKE SURE YOU REALLY WANT THE JOB Legal work can be thrilling, spiced with the intrigue of courtroom drama and back-room dealing -- but not for a paralegal. Let's be serious. Paralegals exist to make lawyers look good. So what is a paralegal? According to the American Bar Association, a paralegal (or legal assistant) is defined as ""a person qualified by education, training or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible."" As a paralegal, you will perform administrative tasks such as filing, retrieving and organizing documents, photocopying, and the ever-popular numbering of pages. Depending on the employer, when taking a break from hole-punching, you may get to participate in more glamorous tasks such as interviewing witnesses or drafting legal documents. Let's be a little more specific. There are essentially two major types of law that are practiced in America: corporate and litigation. Corporate law deals primarily with the dealings of companies, which may, for example, be looking to merge or to acquire new entities, and need lawyers to prepare all the paperwork; litigation is the more typical type of law, involving one party suing another. As a corporate paralegal, you will probably put together record sets. These are large binders filled with primary documents associated with particular business deals. Say a company buys a shopping mall -- a record set of the deal might include the contract to purchase the mall, the leases of all the current tenants in the mall, and all of the myriad tax forms associated with such a purchase. You, as paralegal, would get to photocopy the documents, make sure that they are the final versions (i.e., no rough drafts or preliminary versions), and ensure that they are all in the proper order. Yes! As a litigation paralegal, you will handle the documents associated with trials: motions, which petition the judge for favorable rulings; briefs, which set out the arguments supporting your motions; and depositions, which are interviews of witnesses taken under oath but before the trial begins. You'll spend hours making sure that the pages of all these documents are identical in each set. You'll also do a bunch of indexing -- describing the documents in a computer database, putting papers in boxes, and labeling them, so that attorneys can find them later. What are the benefits of being a paralegal? First of all, the experience may help you figure out what to do with your life. For instance, it might help you decide: Whether you want to be a career paralegal. Whether you want to go to law school. Whether you want to avoid the legal profession entirely.  Second, being a paralegal might help you get into law school. Admissions officers may think that your experience as a paralegal demonstrates that you have carefully considered your decision to enter the field. Also, if you can befriend and impress an attorney or two at your firm, their recommendations could be huge. Remember: work hard and impress. Third, being a paralegal may help you get another job. If you work as a paralegal at an investment bank, an insurance company, or any other major business, there are opportunities to move laterally within the company. So if your stint as a paralegal teaches you nothing other than the legal profession stinks, the years you spent working in it won't have been a waste. Paralegal salaries fluctuate from city to city and, to a lesser extent, from firm to firm. Currently, the average starting salary for a paralegal in the United States is $21,000 - $22,000. This is a base salary for working from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. with a one-hour lunch break, Monday through Friday. That's some of the good news. The bad news is that many employers (particularly large law firms) won't let you escape with such normal hours. If there is work to be done on an important deal or trial, you may be expected to stay late, perhaps until 10:00 p.m. or so. You might also be expected to come in on weekends. Of course, these workloads and expectations vary. So ask before you sign up. And for a real answer, ask the paralegals who work there, not the person trying to hire you. The rest of the good news is that you get paid extra for these hours. In major New York City and Washington, D.C. firms, paralegals are paid time-and-a-half for overtime - any hours over the basic 35 hour workweek. This amounts to $21/hour. Also, you can often make double overtime if you work really crazy hours - anything after 3:00 a.m. or on Sundays and holidays. So if you put in long hours, you're looking at a salary as high as $60,000 a year. And when you work those long nights, your firm will probably give you free food and a cab home. All in all, being a paralegal is relatively flexible. Many non-law firm jobs do not require (or even permit) overtime. On the other hand, crazy hours are impossible to avoid at many large law firms. So you can opt for a cozy lifestyle with livable hours or make some serious cash.
