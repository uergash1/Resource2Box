What kind of workout do I get from an elliptical trainer?  Elliptical trainers offer a smooth cardiovascular workout that can vary from light to high intensity based on your resistance preference. Most elliptical trainers work your upper and lower body (although some models do not have moving upper body components), although using an elliptical trainer is designed to elevate the heart rate more than building muscles.        Is using an elliptical trainer hard on joints?  No, one of the main factors in the increasing popularity of elliptical trainers is lack of joint pressure. The elliptical motion is natural, comfortable, and preferred to running by many exercising enthusiasts, especially those whose joints have been worked hard by a lifetime of running and other high-impact activities.        How does using an elliptical trainer compare to other exercises?  Using an elliptical trainer excels as a pure cardio exercise for weight loss or general fitness. It is similar in effectiveness to running on a treadmill (but with less joint stress). It will not provide the same kind of total body exercise as swimming and rowing. The popularity of elliptical trainers is fueled by the comfort of their motion and ease of use.        What factors should I consider when choosing an elliptical trainer? Should I choose a rear wheel or front wheel elliptical trainer?  The position of the resistance mechanism affects the shape and feel of the elliptical path. Front wheel elliptical trainers have a long, flat elliptical path, that is closer in shape to that of our health club models. Rear wheel elliptical trainers have a relatively higher, rounder path. People who are accustomed to health club ellipticals will likely feel more comfortable with a rear wheel design.        In general, front wheel ellipticals are longer than rear wheel designs, measuring between six and eight feet in length, and they are often richer in features. This leads to them often being more expensive than rear wheel elliptical trainers.       How long a stride do I need?  Stride length is one of the most important considerations when purchasing an elliptical trainer. Especially for taller users, a longer stride length will create a more comfortable motion. In general, rear wheel ellipticals tend to have shorter stride lengths, and some, such as the Eclipse 1100HR/A are specifically designed for shorter users.        How do the resistance mechanisms of elliptical trainers differ?  All our ellipticals use magnetic resistance systems. The main difference between magnetic resistance systems is the weight of the flywheel. As the flywheel becomes heavier, the elliptical motion becomes smoother.        Why are health club/commercial elliptical trainers better?  Health Club/Commercial elliptical trainers, like the Star Trac Natural Runner Plus offer the longest stride lengths, smoothest resistance mechanisms, most complete monitoring, and greatest durability of any machines we offer. They are designed with longevity in mind to absorb years of constant use. They are the ideal machine for someone who wants to accurately replicate the health club experience at home.        Should I consider a remanufactured elliptical trainer?  If you want the health club experience for a more reasonable price, look into our remanufactured elliptical trainers. All our remanufactured elliptical trainers are inspected, tested, and rebuilt at the original manufacturers' factories to ensure a long second life. The Star Trac Natural Runner Remanufactured and the Precor Remanufactured models are remanufactured versions of the most popular ellipticals at gyms.        Do I need a dedicated space for my elliptical trainer?  In most cases, you will want a dedicate a space for your elliptical trainer. All our health club, remanufactured, and full size/front wheel models are designed to be left in place. With our compact/rear wheel models, the vast majority of models, even the full-featured models come with wheels to facilitate easy movement.                What monitoring features do I need?  Most monitors come with standard features, such as time, distance, calories burned, and speed. All our monitors come with a variety of programs. Most models, such as the affordable Eclipse 1100HR, include handgrip heart rate sensors, but more expensive machines often include heart rate recovery programs, that respond to your heart rate to achieve an optimal cardio workout.        How durable are elliptical trainers?  Our home models are designed for regular use by one or two users. Most come with 1 year warranty on moving parts; some, like the New Balance line, feature warranties against frame damage and electronics for additional years. Our health club and remanufactured ellipticals are intended for many hours of use per day and have longer warranties to reflect it.        If a machine comes with a short warranty, don't be detered. The Elliptical Trainer Superstore also offers one, two, and three year in-home warranty plans that can be added to the manufacturer's warranty.        How much assembly does a elliptical trainer require?  Assembly varies from model to model, but most elliptical trainers require between fifteen minutes and one hour for assembly. If you are concerned with assembly time, please be sure to check the assembly section just under the dimensions and specifications. Almost all models come with all tools necessary to assemble your elliptical trainer. The Star Trac Natural Runner models, however, have installation by a Star Trac professional included in their price.        Now that I am informed on elliptical trainers, do you have any additional resources to help me make my decision?  If you have not found a machine that suits your needs, be sure to browse our eBay store for Elliptical Trainers.

Large excavators are useful for digging foundations and other huge projects, but many times you need a smaller excavator to handle more delicate jobs.  When you've got a job that's too big for a shovel but too small for major land-moving equipment, you need a Bobcat excavator. A Bobcat is just larger than your average sedan car, but has a whole lot more power.  With a front-end digging scoop, a Bobcat can get in places that larger machines just can't reach, and haul dirt away quickly and easily.  Thanks to their maneuverability, Bobcat excavators are the machine of choice for landscaping and other jobs where you need to work around existing plants, trees, and buildings. What's more, Bobcats can move over nearly any terrain.  No matter how well-tended the construction site, frequent and heavy traffic will turn any area into a slick muddy mess.  Thankfully, the heavy traction base of the Bobcats combine with their proper weighting to ensure that your Bobcat excavator will have no trouble navigating any construction site, no matter how slick and no matter how hilly. With its versatile size and dependable construction, it's no wonder that Bobcat excavators are a standard piece of equipment for any construction company.  Whether digging for pipes, small foundations, or landscaping, a Bobcat will get the job done.
