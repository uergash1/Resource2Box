They are the corporation tax and the personal income tax. It is the duty of the California state franchise tax board to look after these two taxes. One has to understand a bit about these two taxes too. In order to run, the government requires funds and part of these funds are acquired in the form of taxation. At the end of every 12 months period, the government collects certain taxes. One of these is the income tax. When an individual earns money from his business or through investments, these are his profits and the amount of tax depends on the profit one makes.

Opened in October 1955 as a  motor inn  owned and operated by  Jack Wrather  under an agreement with  Walt Disney , the hotel underwent several expansions and renovations over the years before being acquired by  The Walt Disney Company  in 1988. The hotel was downsized to its present capacity in 1999 as part of the Disneyland Resort expansion.

Walt Disney  wanted to build a hotel for Disneyland visitors to stay overnight, since Disneyland was quite a drive from the established population centers of  Southern California  at the time. However, Disney's financial resources were significantly depleted by the construction of the park, so he negotiated a deal with  Jack Wrather  and his business partner Maria Helen Alvarez under which Wrather-Alvarez Productions would own and operate a hotel called the Disneyland Hotel across the street from Disneyland.  [ 1 ]  Wrather was a  Texas   oil   millionaire  turned  film producer  who already owned hotels in  Las Vegas  and  Palm Springs , and co-owned  television stations  in  Tulsa  and  San Diego  with Alvarez. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   The Wrather years 1955-1984           Disneyland Monorail  train at the Disneyland Hotel station in August, 1963       The original Disneyland Hotel was designed by the firm of  Pereira  &  Luckman  and opened on October 5, 1955, nearly 3 months after Disneyland. Various  strikes  caused the opening to be postponed from the August date advertised in pre-opening promotional materials, and the hotel only had limited capacity when it initially opened. The hotel originally consisted of just over 100 rooms in 5 two-story guest room complexes (later known as the South Garden Rooms and even later as the Oriental Gardens) with shopping, dining and recreational facilities added in early 1956. It also had a doctor and dentist on site as well as a barber and beauty shop. On August 25, 1956, the hotel celebrated its ""official"" grand opening with many Hollywood stars and celebrities attending the festivities.  [ 2 ] It was quickly expanded in 1956 with 3 more North Garden guest room structures, one more North Garden structure in 1958 and lastly, two more North garden structures in 1960. The hotel now boasted over 300 guest rooms and suites. It was one of the first hotels in the region to offer accommodations for four persons per room. Guests traveled between the hotel and  Disneyland Park  via a tram between the hotel and the park main entrance.   When the Wrather-Alvarez partnership ended acrimoniously in 1958, Wrather bought Alvarez' share of Wrather-Alvarez Hotels, making him sole owner of the Disneyland Hotel.   Over the years, the hotel was expanded to include three guest room towers: Sierra (1962; expanded 1966), Marina (1970), and  Bonita  (1978).  [ 3 ]  The  Disneyland Monorail  was extended from its original 1959 configuration and a station opened at the hotel in 1961 (pictured). Recreational areas, attractions, and a convention center (1972) were also added over the years. The hotel also featured a  Richfield   service station  for several years as part of Richfield's sponsorship of several Disneyland attractions, including the  Autopia .     [ edit ]   Disney takes over   When  Michael Eisner  became Chairman & CEO of Walt Disney Productions in 1984, he desperately wanted to get out of Disney's agreement with the Wrather Corporation and bring the Disneyland Hotel under the Walt Disney Company's umbrella. However, Wrather refused to sell, just as he had refused to sell to Walt Disney many years before. Wrather died in 1984, two months after Eisner took over at Disney, and five years later, in 1989, Disney bought the entire Wrather company. As a result, Disney owned other Wrather assets including the  RMS Queen Mary ,  The Lone Ranger  and the TV series  Lassie . Though Disney kept the hotel, it has since sold the other assets that came with the purchase.     [ edit ]   Resort expansion 1999-2001   In 1999, a significant portion of the hotel was demolished to make way for Downtown Disney and parking areas for the newly expanding Disneyland Resort. Most buildings east of the Sierra Tower and north of the Marina Tower were demolished, including the original hotel buildings from 1955. The only buildings remaining in these areas are the convention center and parking garage. Recreational facilities were built in the quad between the three towers, previously site of the Water Wonderland, to replace those that were previously located east of the Sierra Tower. Streets previously used to access the hotel by car were regraded and/or outright eliminated, and a new street was built to access the hotel. Tram service from the hotel was also discontinued, leaving the Monorail as the only vehicular mode of transportation from park to hotel.   The loss of hotel rooms was offset with the opening of  Disney's Grand Californian Hotel  in 2001, but many of the restaurants and amenities that existed prior to 1999 were never replaced.          Disneyland Hotel towers from Downtown Disney. Dreams Tower is at left; Magic Tower at right. The area in foreground was previously the site of the Plaza Building.         [ edit ]   The hotel today   Today none of the original hotel buildings from 1955 remain standing. Very little of the hotel other than parking areas and service facilities sit outside of the perimeter created by the three remaining guest room towers. Original signs and other artifacts from several of the stores and restaurants demolished with the Plaza are on display in the hotel's employee cafeteria.   ESPN Zone ,  Rainforest Caf , and  AMC Theatres  - all  Downtown Disney  venues - now occupy much of the former hotel space east of the Sierra Tower.  Mickey Mouse  theming is employed in many interior furnishings and details. In 2007 the Marina, Sierra, and Bonita Towers were renamed Magic, Dreams, and Wonder, respectively. Other buildings in the sprawling hotel complex house restaurants, stores, offices, recreational facilities and convention and banquet facilities. The complex also features gazebo and garden areas that are used for  Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings & Honeymoons .   A new  Downtown Disney   Monorail Station  was built on the same site as the old Disneyland Hotel station, [ 2 ]  and still takes guests to Tomorrowland inside  Disneyland Park  along the same beamway that existed prior to the 1999-2001 expansion. An exclusive entrance to  Disney's California Adventure  for guests staying at  Disneyland Resort  hotels is a short walk away. The property is estimated to start another renovation before summer of 2008 and be finished in 2010.

The Enchanting Anaheim Disneyland Hotel   In the slide show above, you're viewing  pictures of the Disneyland Hotel's pool and guest rooms.  On this page, you'll discover details for deciding whether or not you'd like to stay at the Disneyland Hotel on your upcoming visit to the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California! Disneyland Hotel's history    Looking at the three tall towers which comprise the Anaheim Disneyland Hotel of today,  it's hard to believe that the Disneyland Hotel began its ""life"" as a small, flat, motel-looking type structure.   My, how times have changed...and for the better! The Disneyland Hotel today is a lush oasis of waterfalls, plants, blooming flower gardens, and topiary sculptures of mascot Mickey Mouse and his friend Goofy.   The 3 tall towers of today's Disneyland Hotel now hold over 900 guest rooms and suites, and the grounds now boast a number of eating establishments, from the quick-bite to the classy. On this page, we'll talk about the interesting possibilities that await you if you stay at the Disney Hotel in Anaheim, California.   Amenities at Anaheim's Disneyland Hotel     First of all, we'll talk about the amenities of the Disneyland Hotel grounds and public areas. The hotel grounds are green and lovely, and a beautiful garden that's fun simply to stroll about and admire. For those who have more in mind than simply strolling, however, you'll find plenty of activities awaiting you. Two swimming pools  await you at the Disneyland Hotel of Anaheim. One is the famous ""Never Land Pool,"" decorated with a Peter Pan theme...complete with Captain Hook's pirate ship! Also for those seeking physical activity, there's a sandy ""beach"" area where you can play volleyball...or, for a more serious workout, you can use the state-of-the-art  exercise center  at the Disneyland Hotel. Love to shop?   At the Disneyland Hotel, you'll enjoy browsing through  2 cute gift shops  near the registration desk of the hotel lobby.  You'll find all the merchandise you want to buy for gifts---and souvenirs that you'll want for yourself and your family.  Merchandise includes Disneyland and Disney Character-themed clothing for all ages, plush animals, postcards, mugs, jewelry, etc. You'll know you're at Disneyland Park before you even head towards your hotel room! A free-standing gift shop awaits you in the midst of the hotel's garden-like grounds, as well.      Amenities of the guest rooms at the Disneyland Hotel--- Each guest room is comfortably spacious.  You'll find thick bed covers, dual-layer drapes (room-darkening layer, with sheers underneath) and matching carpeting---all with Disney character themes woven right into the specially, made-for-this-hotel fabrics. All rooms have room service available, plus refrigerators, voice mail, irons/boards, hair dryers and safes right in each room.  Standard rooms come with either one king or two queen-sized beds; suites up to 3 Bedrooms in size are available.  There is a special ""Concierge Level"" for guests who'd like even more plush surroundings and extra pampering.    Restaurants at the Anaheim Disneyland Hotel     What's the fun-most restaurant at the Anaheim Disneyland Hotel? Hands down, it's got to be ""Goofy's Kitchen.""   At Goofy's Kitchen, you and your children can enjoy one of the famous Disney Character Meals.  Chef Goofy is sure to be there, along with other costumed characters, such as The Mad Hatter or Mickey's dog, Pluto. Meals served at the Goofy's Kitchen Restaurant are all-you-can-eat buffet style.  The particular selections of food rotate daily so that hotel guests won't bore of the menu.  However, there are certain dishes that you'll be sure to find. For breakfast at Goofy's Kitchen,  you'll always find a selection of egg dishes---scrambled eggs and made-before-your-eyes omelet combos being 2 of the most popular.  Then, there will always be a rotation of types of pancakes, waffles, French toast and cereals, plus a smorgasbord of muffins, sweet rolls and croissants.  You'll find plenty of fresh fruit, both whole and sliced, to give you that ""healthy feeling,"" as well. At Lunch and Dinner, you'll find a wide array of dishes--- chicken, beef and fish selections, Mexican dishes, pastas/lasagnes, and that kid-favorite, pizza.  There will be all types of veggies and potatoes to accompany the meal, along with a salad bar, fruit bar, and a top-your-own-baked-potato bar.   The dessert area has still another full array of choices, ranging from hot deserts, such as cobblers, bread pudding and dessert crepes, to cold treats, such as the soft-serve yogurt.  Of course, there will be a selection of cakes, cookies and brownies, as well.  Naturally, a selection of hot and cold beverages come with the buffet meal at Goofy's Kitchen, as well. Would you like more information about enjoying meals with the Disney characters while you're at the resort?   Use the following link to visit the  Disneyland Character Dining page of this website,  in the ""Disneyland Dining"" section.     Simply want to grab some fast food?  Try ""Croc's Bits 'n Bites,""  where such quick-serve favorites such as chicken strips, BBQ sandwiches, burgers and fries are sold. On the other hand,  what's the most ELEGANT restaurant at the Anaheim Disneyland Hotel?  It's Granville's Steak House.   You can find quite a large selection of steaks and beef (eg. prime rib) here, as well as chicken, fish and lobster(!)  Granville's Steak House is also your most expensive dining choice on the Disneyland Hotel property...with entrees running to $35, not including appetizers, drinks or dessert.  You will, however, be rewarded with excellent food and a fine, upscale ambiance.  Notably, kid's meals are reasonably priced at $6--7 (with the children's prime rib plate several dollars more.)  In other words, as far as the kids are concerned, you'll pay no more for them to dine with you than you would at any casual restaurant in town! Breakfast is also served at Granville's Steak House.  You'll find all the ""standards"" here...egg dishes, cereals, pancakes (including  ""Mickey"" pancake for kids!) and French toast. Still another fine dining restaurant at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim is Hook's Pointe.   Mesquite grilled entrees are their specialty.  Beef, pork, chicken, fish and shell fish dishes, as well as pasta entrees, are offered here.  As at Granville's Steak House, the Kid's Meals are reasonably priced, around $6, with several selections offered. For further information about dining options at the Disneyland Hotel,  please view both the  Disneyland Hotel Restaurants  and the  Disneyland Character Dining  pages of this website.    Anaheim Disneyland Hotel Address, Directions, and Room Rates     The Anaheim Disneyland Hotel Address is--- 1150 Magic Way Anaheim, CA  92802 The Anaheim Disneyland Hotel phone number--- Phone number of the Disneyland Hotel Operator:  (714) 778-6600 Disneyland Hotel Reservations Telephone Line:  (714) 956-6425 Disneyland Restaurant reservations phone number:  (714) 781- DINE (3463) Map of the Disneyland Hotel area in Anaheim, California--- The Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim is located adjacent to Disneyland Park and Downtown Disney Anaheim.  Although the address for the Disneyland Hotel is actually on Magic Way, the street you'll need to find is Disneyland Drive...which connects with the major Anaheim streets of Katella (on the south) and Ball Road (on the north.) Also, note that you'll find Disneyland Drive called ""West Street"" on older maps.  This segment of West Street was re-named Disneyland Drive in 2001. Don't worry about getting lost...once you've made it onto Disneyland Drive, your eyes will guide you straight to the Disneyland Hotel---the hotel's tall towers stand right out!    You may use the following link to see a    map of the Anaheim Disneyland Hotel area.    To see more Anaheim maps, and to get more detailed driving instructions to the Disneyland Hotel, you can visit  the ""Disneyland Maps"" page of this website. Have you made the decision to stay at the Disneyland Hotel for your accommodations while in Anaheim?   If so, then you'll certainly want to check out the Disneyland Hotel's official web pages if you're seriously interested in making plans to stay at this fine hotel.  The Disney folks have quite a lovely presentation for you at the Disneyland.com site.  To find the Disneyland Hotel pages on this website, you'll want to skip past the main page of the site, which has all sorts of general information...from theme park activities to the resort's ""latest news.""  To skip directly to the Disneyland Hotel info, you may use the following link to see the   Disneyland Hotel section     of the Disneyland.com website. While you're at the hotel's official site, you may check the list of Disneyland Hotel's room rates.  As you'll quickly notice, room rates at the Disneyland Hotel vary widely.  Having a beautiful view of the Never Land Pool and courtyard greenery is going to cost quite a bit more than having a view of the parking lots (tactfully called a ""city view"" on the site!)  You'll also notice that room rates vary a great deal depending on whether or not your trip will be during the school year...or if it will be during the summer vacation time or a major holiday period. You'll also be able to discover rates for Disneyland Hotel packages which include theme park tickets in the deal, as well.

At the base of the tower is the lobby, restaurants, a gift shop, recreational facilities, over 30,000 square feet (3,000 m) for meeting space, and a 7,250-square-foot (670 m) ballroom.   The pool was recently renovated to include a waterslide themed to the  California Screamin'  roller coaster, known as  California Streamin' .

Disney  purchased the property in December 1995 and changed its name to Disneyland Pacific Hotel. As part of the 1998-2001 expansion of the Disneyland Resort, the hotel was re-branded as Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel to complement the themed land the hotel tower overlooks in the adjacent Disney's California Adventure Park. The lobby and convention/banquet facilities have undergone several renovations since the re-branding, most notably in 2004 and 2005.   Hotel guests at one time had an exclusive entrance to Disney's California Adventure Park, located between the Corn Dog Castle and Souvenir 66 in the Paradise Pier section of the park, but it was closed due to low use in 2004. The area is now the site of the expansion of  Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa . Guests may still access the park through the turnstiles located in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, which are officially exclusive to guests of all Disneyland Resort hotels.     [ edit ]   13th floor   The hotel is one of the few tall buildings in the Western Hemisphere to have a 13th floor. Due to the common superstition of the number 13, most buildings in America skip that number  the floor after 12 is 14, then 15 and so on. This is a result of the original owners being from Japan, where 13 is not considered bad luck. Disney has not since changed this.
