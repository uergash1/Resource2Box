By  James Gray  on Tuesday, April 29th, 2008                  I find it fascinating that theres so little information available out there on the value of taxonomy as a founding principle in Web design strategy.   Taxonomy - the study of the general principles of scientific classification - has been around for hundreds of years. In Web work, its generally the organization of contexts into logical groupings and hierarchies.   Its those groupings that, in turn, help IAs determine navigation structures, metadata, even the very nomenclatures that are the foundation of Web usability best practices.   If youve ever been approached to help a client correct a truly horrific Web site, youve no doubt found that some (possibly much) of their pain points can be traced back to a poorly designed  or altogether missing  taxonomy.   Maybe its that those of us who build Web strategies have just come to see taxonomy as a given within the Information Architects toolset — something IAs employ but neednt share with the rest of the creative team or [forbid!] the client.   Maybe people think taxonomy is just an issue for larger, content rich  KM sites .   Maybe Im not finding a lot out there because whoever is writing tomes on taxonomy best practices just isnt remembering to add metadata to their articles.   Ok. That was a cheap shot. But where IS the supporting data in Taxonomys defense? Im disappointed by just how little taxonomy information is out there on the Web. Do a search on your own and youll see examples for Taxonomy best-practices and rationales are few and far between.   As a creative body, IAs all too often struggle with clients who just want to see the comps. Clients dont realize how much of their bottom line rides on the contextual storylines inherent in the usability of the site.   The process of taxonomy creation is really much easier and effective than the name might imply. Yet, Im amazed at how few IAs are given [or is it take?] the time to apply it. And Ive [almost] never seen nor heard of a client demand a content outline as a deliverable.   I recall a previous colleague who was asked to design wireframes as the initial deliverable for a large eCommerce client. He produced very innovative wires complete with auxiliary navigations, functional buttons, web 2.0 components& the whole nine yards. The client was delighted with the results. After all, they were the pre-cursors to some beautiful graphics.   The site, however, was completely useless. By not first establishing a contextual format for the linear plots and subplots of the user experience, the navigation buckets were little more than a sloppy hodgepodge of disparate functions and features. The sites organization lacked cohesion and the end users simply couldnt build a mental storyline around its intended purpose.   Thats why, whether creating a new site or performing an audit on an existing one, I find reviewing the sites taxonomics an invaluable starting point.   I begin with a literary outline based on the sites overarching goals. Sound too old school for todays hyper-connected world? Youd be amazed at how much mileage you can get by FIRST establishing the value of those straight pathways. It helps the client visualize those important subplots that will eventually become the sites use cases. It also points out where there are potential holes or disparages in the clients existing content sets and expectations. It also grounds them in reality that these areas of the site will need to be created AND maintained by someone in order to be successful.   More important, were helping rationalize and strengthen their business requirements  an important pre-visual practice  before  going to the expense of designing (and redesigning) wireframes or comps.   After all, isnt the role of a good taxonomy advisor to SAVE the client some money?                           3309                Posted in  User Experience ,   User-Generated Content ,   Usability ,   Research ,   Web Design  |    No Comments »                            Entrepreneurs shine in Emory University Event         By  Joe Koufman  on Monday, April 28th, 2008                  The Goizueta Business School of Emory University hosted a Spring 2008  Entrepreneurial Leadership Event  on Wednesday night, April 23, 2008that featured:     David Duncan, CEO of  Paddywax, Inc.  and President of  The Atlanta Chapter of the  Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO)   S. Dee Davis, CEO of  Digital Visual Display Technologies, Inc.   Mike Landman, Founder and CEO of  Ripple, Inc.   Jeff Hilimire, Co-Founder and President of  Engauge Digital  (formerly Spunlogic)     The event drew a large (100+) and diverse crowd of mostly students and entrepreneurs. When one panelist asked how many in the room were business owners, about half of the hands were raised. The dialogue was frank and providedinsights into the reasoning and drive that helped each entrepreneur endure the challenges that business owners face.   The best way to disseminate the information that the seasoned entrepreneurs shared is to list out some of my favorite highlights from the panel (paraphrased by me). David Duncan did a great job of moderating, so most of the answers did not come from him.   What is your best entrepreneurial advice?   Dee Davis:  You have to lead by example and take the pulse of the business frequently.   Mike Landman:  It is easy to take on more risk when you are young because you have less to risk.   Jeff Hilimire:  You have to be all in to start a business. There is no pressure for you to give the business a 100% chance when it is only a hobby.   How do you recommend building a team?   Dee Davis:  You need a relatively flat structure when the company is young.   Mike Landman:  We use a lot ofpre-hire testing and multiple interviews.   Jeff Hilimire:  Promoting from within is the best practice.   What is the best advice you have been given?   Dee Davis:  Energy and persistence conquer all things  Ben Franklin  Get out of your comfort zone!  Bob Parsons   Mike Landman:  Fight through the brick walls that are everywhere. - Randy Pausch (Carnegie Mellon Professor)   Jeff Hilimire:  Lead by exampleand Passion, Intelligence, andHard Work are the three most important traits of an entrepreneur.   What is the one thing that you wish you knew when you started your business?   Dee Davis:  I am not the smartest guy in the room, so try to fill the room with smart guys.   Mike Landman:  Marketing and managing cash flow.   Jeff Hilimire:  How to hire the right person.   What is your best marketing advice?   Dee Davis:  Think in different ways from your competitors. Get out there and meet people.   Mike Landman:  Pick a small enough niche to become an expert in that space.   Jeff Hilimire:  Become a thought leader and host private events that show off this leadership.   How do you go about finding the best sales person for your team?   Dee Davis:  Incent your sales people REALLY well. Some may make more than the CEO.   Mike Landman:  Be your companys best salesperson.   Jeff Hilimire:  Find someone with skills, but who you are alsoreally comfortable with, as they will be representing you!   Jeff also gave a plug to yours truly, which was an unexpected bonus…   Everyone who attended the event was highly engaged, and they seemed very appreciative of the wisdom that the panel imparted.

By  Jay Jhun  on Friday, April 25th, 2008                  As I was eating my spaghetti leftovers yesterday for lunch at my desk (sad, I know), I came across news that  Arby’s  is merging with  Wendy’s .   Suddenly a vision came to me and I thought I’d begin the process of voicing what awesome combinations of lunch could come forth from such a melding of quick service restaurant chains (this would make Arbys + Wendy’s into #3 behind the other two - you know who they are).   Combo #1 - Beef ‘n Cheddar + Vanilla Frosty     And for the marketing spin, how’s this for a new tagline: “I’m thinking this is WAAAAY better than McD and BK” (it’s awful, I know, but it’s all I could conjure up on leftover lunch).   Happy Lunch Hour to all - would love to hear other visions of combos.

It was done in Germany - which should be no surprise, this would never be passable in the US - to promotean action and suspense channel called “13th Street.”     I get the impression you either love or hate this idea. Obviously I think it’s awesome, and so does  Jeff Hilimire . But, one of my friends/coworkers pointed out that she would likely have a panic attack if she was exposed to this campaign unknowingly.   They placed a substance that would luminesce in black light on the walls, sink and mirror in anightclub bathroom in Hamburg. The manner it was applied mimicked that of a crime scene.   Then they timed the traditional lighting in the room to replace with blacklight after a subject entered the room; exposingthe “bloodbath” as well as the logo, tagline -  See What Others Don’t See  - and the web address of the television station .   Check out  more pictures here. Talk about thinking outside the box; this is experiential marketing at its best. Maybe not passable in the US, but it definitely makes you think about what’s possible.                                         Posted in  Creative  |    2 Comments »                            This early adopter has seen the future…         By  Jeff Hilimire  on Tuesday, April 15th, 2008                    Ok, so maybe that title is a little dramatic, but I still feel like Ive seen something that today is so foreign to most everyone but in 5 years will be completely commonplace.   For my recent birthday my mother, who I thought I had taught never to buy me any electronics for fear of reliving the Mapping Software incident of 2003, on her own judgment went and bought me the new Amazon Kindle.   The Kindle, if you arent up to speed on it, is Amazons answer to the digital book.  Instead of buying paper books, you download them to your Kindle and read them on the device.  It uses a new inking technology that basically makes the pages look as if they were printed in a book.  Heres a quick CNET video on it (or you can read a great  Newsweek article on the Kindle ):       I was pretty skeptical about it at first but having used this for a few days, it really is very easy to read on the device.  I subscribed to the Atlanta Journal & Constitution as well as the Wall Street Journal and both arrive on the Kindle before I wake up, and when I read them I dont get that ink all over my hands like you would with a newspaper.   Plus I can highlight sections on it, look up the definition of words (for the WSJ, Im not sure the AJC knows any big words) and save content for later.  Its been a blast using it so far.   So why do I think this is something that will be commonplace in a few years?  Think about going to the beach for a week and having to pack 2 or 3 books.  Think about kids in school having to carry big backpacks with all their books in them.  If there was a device that was easy to read on and easy to download books, why wouldnt we all shift over to this?   But the real reason I think this is the future is because of the greenness of it.  Think of all the trees that would be saved if we didnt have to print millions of books each year.   Once Al Gore gets behind this thing, itll be as popular as when he invented the Internet.                                         Posted in  Emerging Technology ,   Technology  2083  |    3 Comments »                            Will Starbucks Turn it Around?         By  Stephanie Critchfield  on Thursday, April 10th, 2008                  Bree posted a link to  Starbucks’ online coffee promotion  - free brew-at-home coffee samples with the completion of a little flavor preference quiz.   While I definitely appreciated the nifty interactive interface for this promotion (Bree called it brilliant - I mean, who doesn’t want free coffee?), it’s actually a symptom of a much larger problem at Starbucks.   A  BusinessWeek article  published yesterday stated “Starbucks ( SBUX ) stock dropped 42.8% in 2007 and is down 14.7% since the start of 2008.” That’s cause for concern.   A result, many consumers are beginning to witness a massive re-branding exercise, aimed at improving Starbucks’ bottom line. This exercise began as far back as January when Starbucks re-elected company founder Howard Schulz as CEO. Immediately, Howard whipped up a  “Transformation Agenda,” communicated to the public on their website as numbered announcements.    Here’s What’s Up.   Over a period of several years, Starbucks grew to become an Arcadia to coffee lovers. But, over the past couple of years, this paradise has begun to slip away from them.   Even though the company still maintains a loyal following (I know at least one person who goes their 2x per day every day), less loyal people are flocking to cheaper vendors who are now offering “premium” blends, such as McDonalds and Dunkin’ Donuts.  A recent article  even pointed out that McDonalds plans to launch espressos and mochas nationwide this year.   How Does Starbucks Plan to Regain Their Position?   Watching this Transformation Agenda come to fruition has been fascinating to watch. It’s a truly massive business, sales, and marketing initiative from top to bottom. The Agenda outlines the following courses of action:     Slow the pace of U.S. store openings and accelerate internationally   Discontinue warmed breakfast sandwiches at our North American stores  (the smell interferes with the aroma of their coffee … Um, k.)    Going forward, they will not report same store sales comps   Reinvent partner training   Reinstating regularly scheduled open forums in the field   Bring back the Leadership Conference     Through the numbered announcements and other research, I was also able to identify the following.     Adding Wi-Fi to all US stores (rolling out this service market-by-market to more than 7,000 Starbucks stores)   In-store training for their more than more than 135,000 store partners in the US. (which included closing stores during this training)   A reorganization that will eliminate 600 positions (mostly non-retail support folks)   Introduction of the Park Place blend (the everyday Joe’s blend - smoother than most Starbucks blends that’s receiving very mixed reviews)     Ask the Customer   Throughout nearly every Agenda announcement written by Howard he stresses the importance to have a “laser focus” on the customer. This left me saying “but, are you talking to them yet??” Well, today I just discovered that the company is now soliciting feedback from customers through a CRM portal called “ My Starbucks Idea .”     I’m not sure when it launched, but it is a pretty serious endeavor. Interestingly, the portal is powered by  Salesforce.com  - a sign of their commitment for this venture to be truly built around the customer relationship. Many ideas are very creative. Others are just painfully obvious - like frequent buyer cards. I suppose it never dawned on me, but Starbucks has never offered a buy 9 get one free card before!   Now, of course, what’s most important is  what they do with this feedback . If they’re really “laser focused” on the customer, then the most important changes they make will stem from a consensus of pain points and ideas generated from My Starbucks Idea, in addition to the important business and organizational changes.   Going Back to Their Roots.   Another decision was made to - if only temporarily - bring back the store’s original logo, used on the coffee cup and sleeves.     It’s a strange double-finned mermaid thing (I should probably have known what this was, but I’m not up on my maritime mythical lore.  Here’s what it is , if you’re curious. Funny, but I guess even the “new” logo is also this double-finned creature, you just see mostly her face). Anyway …. it’s not really the logo that matters. It’s symbolic of their commitment to bring Starbucks back to its roots - before they tried to be all things to all people. CDs, sandwiches, a shop on every corner…   What’s probably most promising is that this is clearly not a slapdash program. Howard and the rest of Starbucks’ leadership are executing on careful planning, and communicating to shareholders, the public, and their partners in a very systematic fashion.   What Do You Think?   So what does everyone out there think? What would you tell  Tomer  (our Director of Development) who has stock in Starbucks? Hang in there, or cash it in?                           262f                Posted in  General  |    5 Comments »                            Collaboration! It’s More than Tools.         By  Angie Terrell  on Wednesday, April 9th, 2008                    Full Disclosure - I’m not sure if you’ll believe me, but I started this blog BEFORE Stan Rapp and Rick Milenthal each gave separate presentations on the future of the Collaborative Model, of Engauage, to us here at Engauge Digital (formerly Spunlogic).   I’m certainly not anything special. And certainly not as visionary as the leaders of this new Engauge agency model. In retrospect, what I think happened is that in the past three months that I have been here, I have observed how Spunlogic sets itself apart by its level of effective collaboration. AND, that is exactly why Stan, Rick and the other leaders of Engauge thought we were such a great fit to this new agency model. It was synchronicity!   Wiki ,  Basecamp , Video Conference,  GoTo Meeting ,  Sosius ,  Joyent , etc. are tools that help us collaborate. But, can tools make collaboration successful in and of themselves? Absolutely not.   Effective collaboration is impossible without the existence of important human factors. Teams made of members, equal in their contribution, all offering a unique skill set and points of view, come together to form an effective and efficient organism. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,  sometimes . Stan Rapp made a great point by saying that true collaboration occurs when “specialists  voluntarily  join together to provide amazing results.”   That’s the power of collaboration. While tools can facilitate the communication and organization of the team, there is no substitute for true passion, skill, and camaraderie.   One of the wonderful things about Wiki is that everyone can contribute. It provides equalization of information, democracy in action, freedom of speech. This is what everyone finds so liberating about these tools. But we all know what speech can be like if collaboration breaks down. Silence, probably the best option, or worse, hurtful, discriminating and demoralizing speech impacting the entire group. What the best tools can do is to aid in the access and ease of information and knowledge sharing. What we humans have to do is the hard part.   So what makes human collaboration effective?   + Atmosphere of trust & respect  + Creativity  + Open, regular and organized communication  + Understanding everyone’s roles & responsibilities  + Highlighting everyone’s strengths  + Have fun: laugh and play  + Learning from each other  + Everyone feels empowered to make decisions  + Everyone is after a common goal   When does collaboration breakdown?   + CYA: paranoia amongst team members  + Process for the sake of process  + No fun! It’s all work, work, work  + Meeting for the sake of meeting  + Silos of communication  + Decisions can only be made top-down  + Everyone has their own goals they are trying to achieve through the group   No tools can prevent or promote these things. This has to come from us. If we don’t protect these things then the door is wide open for breakdown to creep in.   So the next time you are meeting with a colleague, thinking about how to solve a problem, constructing a project plan, remember the power of effective collaboration and amazing results will ensue!

By  Stephanie Critchfield  on Tuesday, April 8th, 2008                  Everyone involved in digital marketing is well aware that every year —  since, what, 2000?  — has been named “The Year of Mobile.”   Without surprise, yet another year is coming up short.   AdAge  came out with an interesting article ( Why ‘08 Isn’t Mobile’s Year — Again  [requires subscription to read]) that tackles the reasons why we have been prematurely forecasting every new year as THE year, along with fixes that make 2009 more probable.   AdAge’s outlined mobile’s challenges as:   CHALLENGE NO. 1: REACH (OR LACK THEREOF)  CHALLENGE NO. 2: MEASUREMENT  CHALLENGE NO. 3: COMPLEXITY  CHALLENGE NO. 4: THE MISNOMER OF MOBILE AS AD MEDIUM  CHALLENGE NO 5: THERE’S BEEN NO HALLELUJAH MOMENT   I think Ad Age did a really decent job of identifying the pieces of the puzzle that must fit together before THE year can happen. The biggest point is that the technology need to reach the masses is still not widely adopted.   “Of the 219 million U.S. wireless subscribers, just over 30 million are on data plans, according to M:Metrics. That means more than 86.1% still use mobile devices primarily for talk, which isn’t optimal for mobile marketing.”   Clearly, there is progress that needs to be made before mobile takes off. As AdAge suggests, beginning to define the elements that will create success now will serve us well when the audience is ready for it.

David   12 Sep 2005   111 comments   Latest by  loisnicholas                        We all cheered as Yahoo cut the check and rewarded one of the most promising startups in Web 2.0. And rightfully so. Flickr took something as mundane as sharing your pictures online and spun it in a way that made everyone want to take lots of pictures.    But it was more than that. The human voice of Flickr gave it a homey, quirky sense of people having fun doing what they love. From the very first moment you not only liked the service but also cared for the people behind it. It was enough to make it a no-brainer to put your photos on their server.    Now that welcoming, quirky, human voice has been strangled and replaced by the metallic commands of a corporate droid. It’s a damn shame and a terrible business move, in my humble opinion. Hopefully it won’t stand.                 Consider the signup screen for Flickr before Yahoo:       They make jokes about the screen name, remind you that it’s changeable, express their hatred for spam, and poke fun at the terms of use. And just as importantly, they only ask three questions and a confirmation. That’s it. Takes no time to complete, involves little brain activity, and you get to chuckle about it. In other words, a near perfect signup procedure.    Now consider the signup screen for Flickr after Yahoo (which in true megaplex style requires three redirects and clicking signup twice, both on Flickr and the Yahoo-Flickr site):       Not only is it two-and-a-half times longer, it involves  sixteen  questions and an opt-out cross-sell “opportunity” to get Yahoo Mail. It wants to know what industry you’re in and whether you like your Yahoo content from the US or Korea. It needs your first name, last name, gender, and possibly the middle name of your father.    It features a terms of service agreement that sounds like it was written by nasty lawyers armed with medieval instruments of truth-extraction. And they display it in the classic nobody-is-ever-going-to-read-this 4-line textarea.     The contrast to plain English terms like “You must not abuse, harass, threaten, impersonate or intimidate other Flickr users” from the  original agreement  couldn’t be starker.    “But only pedantic industry insiders care about all of this,” you say? Wrong. The only reason I dug into this issue and found these apalling before and after shots is because my lovely girlfriend tried to sign up for Flickr last night.     She didn’t made it and  ended up  at  23hq  instead. Flickr squandered the implicit trust I had for them by subjecting her to this cruel and unsual signup hell.    This, however, is not meant to be a slam as much as a cry for mercy. Yahoo, Flickr, we know you guys can do so much better than this. We know that you don’t intend to poison the well for future acquisitions and make users hate them on instinct.    To Yahoo : Recognize that the reason you bought Flickr in the first place was (hopefully) because you liked the groove they had going on. And even more so, you liked the demonstrated success of said groove. Consider if the droidinization of Flickr perhaps couldn’t have happened slower, later, and with fewer casulties. You guys stand to be the new cool. This is one step forward, two backwards.    To Flickr : Come on, guys. You had us eating out of your palms. You’re so much cooler than this. We know its  not your lips talking  when you say “Another motivation is all the stuff that Flickr can leverage from around the Yahoo! network if people can use their Yahoo! IDs in Flickr.”    In other words, this is not about big being bad (we have plenty of other posts on that). This is just about not turning people away at the door, about doing more of what made you superstars in the first place, and about showing that the latest surge of M&A activity isn’t all about killing kittens.    We trust that the two of you can work it out!                          111 comments so far             ( Jump to latest )                                             greggo my eggo            12 Sep 05     Oh dear. I’ve already saught professional counseling as a result of the near-raping of Flickr. Maybe Yahoo! can reimburse me.                                 Joshua Rudd            12 Sep 05     My wife had the same frustration when trying to sign up for a Flickr account — the very same day that they began requiring new accounts to sign up with a Yahoo! ID.    After an hour of frustration (trying to update her old Yahoo! account settings to reflect her new email address) and then being unable to delete her new Flickr account because the passwords mismatched (which they didn’t), she gave up, sent Flickr a nasty email, and vowed to never use Flickr.    It’s a shame because she didn’t get to experience the coolness the is (or was) Flickr, and i doubt she’ll give it another try — and she’s only one case-in-point.                                 Jay Owen            12 Sep 05     I experienced this same problem when I suggested someone signup for Flickr. I said… “hey, give this a try, it’s easy to signup and use…”    Well it turns out that it is no longer easy to sign up, it is a royal pain. It’s a sad story and a good example of getting real in reverse.                                Dana O           12 Sep 05     I’d hope that Flickr comes through too. I was a Pro account holder before Yahoo came along. Since then they gave members some free perks (like extended memberships and things). If things keep going the way they are though, I may cancel my account after the free stuff ends….                                 Joe Clark            12 Sep 05     It seems like your complaint is really about the complexity of signing up for a Yahoo userID, which you only have to do if you don’t have one in the first place. If it were a three-question exercise complete with witty repartee, would you mind so much?    The business about  ancien  Flickr being homey and fun while  nouveau  Flickr is a corporate sellout is a bit oversold, I think.                                 Brandon            12 Sep 05     I signed up for Flickr just a couple of days before they started allowing Yahoo! ID logins. Recently I found this on the Flickr Help Page:    “Please note that we will be migrating all independent Flickr accounts to Yahoo!’s network in 2006. At that time, if you have not done so already, you will be asked to create a Yahoo! ID (or link your account to your Yahoo! ID if you already have one) in order to continue using your account.”    I signed up for Flickr. The last things I want are a Yahoo! email account and access to the Yahoo! network. When they force me to create a Yahoo! ID, and make me go through that arcane sign-up page, they’ll lose me as a customer.                                  raul            12 Sep 05     amen. the reason people were so religious about flickr was because of it’s human scale. The small niceties like a simple signup devoid of marketing and legalese are the hallmark of a company committed to it’s users rather than to some larger corporate entity.                                 Jeff Croft            12 Sep 05     Sorry, but I’m with Joe Clark on this one. The process of signing up for a Yahoo ID is a bit more complicated than the process of signing up for an old Flickr account, but that’s really the extent of the “corporatisim” in the new Flickr. In my opinion, Flickr has done a very good job of keeping its edge despite it having a corporate giant for an owner. Flickr still “has massages.” We still get the blog from Heather and Caterina. All in all, it’s the same old place. The signup process could be easier, but like Joe said — the idea that Flickr is totally different now that it’s corporate it totally oversold.                                Brad           12 Sep 05     The Yahoo registration process is a deterrent in general, I think. A friend of mine recently invited me to join a Yahoo group she created, but I decide not to join after being confronted with the Yahoo signup page and reading their terms of use…I figured I’d either get flooded with spam or Yahoo would drop some spyware into my computer, or both.                                 Jake Tracey            12 Sep 05     I’ve been meaning to write about this for quite a while. A couple of months back when Yahoo! launched their new search interface, it seemed as if they were getting on the right track in terms of image again. Employees even had blogs, long before (most) other companies jumped on the bandwagon. The acquisition of products like Flickr and Konfabulator again strengthened the idea that yeah, Yahoo!might not be just a corporate behemoth. Hell, they may even ‘get it’.     Unfortunately, it’s a little sad to see some of the bad decisions they’ve made in the past few weeks. From the Y! Messenger default settings that change your default home page to the rename of Konfabulator to Yahoo! Widgets and now this.    What Yahoo! doesn’t understand is that no one wants to join them anymore. It feels like it’s always the bottom line at work (get that extra lead/sale/signup), and that isn’t the kind of business that people are passionate about.                                emm ess eff           12 Sep 05     With apologies to the Buggles:    Yahoo killed the Web 2.0 star  Yahoo killed the Web 2.0 star    Pictures came and broke your heart.

I just signed into Yahoo and was done.  From all the comments here it seems I am in the minority as most users don’t have Yahoo ids?

As you may have already heard, Oddpost was acquired by Yahoo! last year. Since then we’ve been cranking away on a new version of Yahoo! Mail, and we’re just about ready to show it to you and hear what you think.    If you’d like to try out the new Yahoo! Mail beta, send an email from your Oddpost account to support@oddpost.com and include:    1. Your Oddpost username  2. Your Yahoo! ID (if you do not have a Yahoo! ID, you can get one for free by clicking here)  We’ll email you back as soon as your beta account is ready to go.    IMPORTANT: we are NOT migrating your Oddpost account now. This is just a sneak peek of what’s in store for all Oddpost users in the months to come.    Thanks very much, we’re looking forward to your feedback!  The Oddpost team    P.S. for the nerds: if you like the new Yahoo! Mail beta so much that you’d like to start using it full-time for your mail, drop us a line and we’ll happily start forwarding your Oddpost mail over to Yahoo! now.

They’ve turned a casual walk in the park into a mountain trek across three state lines.

Jimbo           12 Sep 05     David, Sorry that this is off-topic, but I was wondering could you share how you took your Yahoo! webpage image. I’ve been trying to do this with Safari (Save-as-pdf, and tweaking the page settings so that it all renders on a single page). There must be an easier way!                                  Brady           12 Sep 05     Pretty awful.  I’ve tried to walk users that did not have an email address through Yahoo’s sign-up form and it is painful.  MSN’s is worse.    Hopefully Flickr won’t be degraded in other areas.  But, hey, if it does it opens the market for a new player!                                 Jake Tracey            12 Sep 05     “Jake, what you don understand is that most of the world isn like you. Your techie, your in the know. Most aren and would happily join Yahoo.”    Why would a regular consumer join Yahoo over any other company? Yahoo has lost a huge amount of mindshare in the past few years (in a number of different markets) and will continue to do so if they keep making poor decisions. Flickr was gaining popularity at a very fast rate and could’ve held it’s own without this change — after reading some responses to the changes it seems they might even lose a portion of the users that joined the service before the acquisition.     There are plenty of examples of host companies that successfully promote individual brands without making arbitrary changes like Yahoo does — wouldn’t you agree that by basically making Flickr a Yahoo branded service it lowers the chances of Flickr being known as THE place to share photos?                                 Brandon            12 Sep 05     “Brandon: Youe a USER, not a CUSTOMER. That one helluva difference.”    I don’t agree, Thomas. Yes, I use Flickr’s service. But if I like the experience, then once a year I will pay money to Flickr and in exchange they will provide me with a service to use. Isn’t that the basic relationship between any seller/buyer, producer/consumer? Customer and user aren’t mutually exclusive. Am I not both at the same time when paying for and using Flickr?    I don’t find Yahoo’s services appealing, and haven’t really enjoyed the past experiences I’ve had with them. So my point was that if Yahoo takes over Flickr with a heavy hand, changes the “culture,” and turns it into just another Yahoo service, I’m not going to be happy with it anymore and will stop paying for the right to use it. Yes, that will make me a former USER of Flickr, but when we cease to exchange money for goods and services, that will also make me a former CUSTOMER.                                 Charles Miller            12 Sep 05     When Flickr introduced Yahoo! logins, I moved over to my (existing) Yahoo! screen-name almost immediately. I didn’t really care either way, but since the documentation stated quite starkly that my existing Flickr ID was going to be made obselete some time in the future, I figured I may as well make the switch.    What they  didn’t  mention was… “Remember me” didn’t work. They only fixed that a few days ago. Which suggests to me that Flickr was pushed quite firmly towards screen-name sharing , even before it could be completely implemented.    Meanwhile, another annoyance has surfaced. I like having Flickr remember my identity, but I feel uncomfortable staying logged in to the entire network of Yahoo sites, most of which I don’t use. However, I can’t stay logged into one without being logged into them all.                                Anonymous Coward           12 Sep 05     @Jimbo, I bet he used  Paparazzi                                 Tim Lucas            12 Sep 05     I’m not stating my opinion, only my experiences, and I’ve had 2 friends in the past few days refuse to sign up to Flickr because of the rego process (and they’re both non-techies). One went to Kodakgallery instead, even after my constant harassment, and the other decided sharing photos wasn’t for them. I hadn’t even noticed they’d changed the process until I asked them why they hadn’t registered yet.                                  Brad           12 Sep 05     Jeff Croft: Corporate Sellouts?

I’m  sure  Yahoo told our Flickr buddies: “We love Flickr as it is and promise not to change it … much.”    The Flickr folk were probably too busy counting the zeros on the check in front of them, and missed that little disclaimer. Sellouts.    I’m just pissed that I never got around to applying for that Linux sysadmin job Flickr had posted pre-buyout. Wonder what my options would’ve been worth?  :)                                  Firefly           12 Sep 05     Flickr is dying…    A corporate picture site is spawned.                                 Peter Mentzer            12 Sep 05     Anyone else notice the fact that the flickr logo **still** says “beta”? I think that’s kind of funny.  I don’t know, but the ‘beta’ thing kind of rubs me the wrong way. Like, you can pull it off when it’s just you and a couple folks trying out your idea, but once yahoo buys you? Then it just becomes a marketing ploy to make your company seem “accessible”. You know, like hey, we’re just a couple guys with some computers in our garage trying something “nifty” (to use a flickr type word.)                                kmilden           12 Sep 05     Yahoo wonders why google owns 60% of search. It is because they keep it simple, real, and to the point. Google buys bloggerthey didn’t add their logo, a 16 question sign-up form, or tie it into a gmail upsell…                                 JenF            12 Sep 05     So what’s a Flickr type company to do when they do sell to a big bohemoth like Yahoo? Our company was in a similar situation. One day we were 4 people making our own rules, and the next, we were owned by a publicly-held company with a board of directors and volumes of rules and regulations that need to be followed as a public company. And OMG don’t get me started on Sarbanes Oxley.     We  have  to have terms and conditions - we simply can’t get around it. Does anybody have any suggestions on incorporating them in such a way as to not send droves of people running away screaming for their lives? We want to stay nifty and fun and connect with our customers, but we have to do it within the rules of the parent company.                                  Beau Hartshorne            12 Sep 05     A Yahoo account provides much more than just Flickr access. I can see the need for more vigorous bot checking, and for a few extra measures to protect a user’s identity. Your old Flickr account didn’t have a finance section. Considering the constraints, what could be better? Can we lose the “Customizing Yahoo” section?                                Mr. Jones           12 Sep 05     If your girlfriend is unable to handle Yahoo’s signup form, she is probably better off using 23hq.

Anonymous           12 Sep 05     You people act like signing up with Yahoo is like signing some contract that forces you to use all their services. You don’t have to use Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Forums or any of Yahoo’s services if you don’t want to. All that changes is the Flickr signup and signin forms are a little different.                                  Brad           12 Sep 05     Anonymous:  All that changes is the Flickr signup and signin forms are a little different.    You miss the point.      Something that was simple has become complex with no added benefit.      You might argue that there is added benefit, that Yahoo offers services you didn’t have a choice with before.  That’s not the point.  If you want to sign up with Flickr now, it’s more complicated than before.  Period.    This argues what I continue to feel about convergence in all realms.  Do one thing and do it well.  Phones shouldn’t be MP3 players or cameras.  MP3 players shouldn’t be PDA’s.  Still cameras shouldn’t be video cameras.  All these things make sense on the surface but fall apart in practice.  Just because something has a processor inside, doesn’t mean it should take advantage of every single aspect of the processor.  My PVR has a hard drive and a CPU, but that doesn’t mean it should be used as a camera.      So then the argument goes, but I have so many devices.  Combining them makes things easier.  I say no.  It’s like the Yahoo sign up form for Flickr.  I can do lots on that form, but it sucks and I don’t like it.  I want a phone that works as a phone, a camera that works as a really good camera and an MP3 player that is called the iPod nano.      Do one thing and do it well.  If you want to do something else, create a new brand or a new category.      Yahoo should have hidden themselves behind Flickr and used their power to market and promote from outside the spectrum.  Instead they cannibalized their audience and will inevitably turn Flickr into something unrecognizable.    Read  Positioning  by Jack Trout and Al Ries.  Even though it all about marketing, but so is everything.    One final argument for this tangent.  We love (I assume) 37Signals for what they do.  But if JF came out tomorrow and said, “We’re selling TVs”, not only would we not buy their TVs, but we would lose some interest in their existing product line.  Why?  37Signals represents great web applications.  But that greatness does not extend to other realms.  Yahoo doesn’t understand that Flickr meant something to its supporters.  Just because Yahoo and Flickr are both Internet companies does not make them compatible brands.  I’m not saying Yahoo shouldn’t have bought Flickr, I’m just saying they did it the wrong way.  Theye an Internet company with no real identity.  What is Yahoo?  Who knows?  But this is the message of the Flickr form:     ey, sign up for Flickr and Yahoo Email, and get a Yahoo ID (well actually you need a yahoo ID) and if you don have one, well, here how you get one and if youe forgotten it well here is how you get it back and thanks for you support and if you don want spam please let us know otherwise wel send it to you./em>    Instead of:    Make a great online photo album without hassles                                 vishi            12 Sep 05     The Flickr login was done by one guy, while this decision came out of a discussion.                                Chris           12 Sep 05     Brad is totally correct. I’m glad someone commenting “gets” it rather than simply flaming.                                 Brady           12 Sep 05     cheers to Brad                                James Cruden           13 Sep 05     It’s odd to read this reaction and mesh it with the frequent calls in the comments on this very site for a practically identical maneuver by 37signals for their own products.    All that Yahoo! has done here is pull their newly acquired “product” under their existing set of products and allow users to login to all the Yahoo! services with the same account.    I completely fail to understand how that would cause problems for people.     90% of the websites out there that require registration want too much information from you. Simple fact is that they’re holding the cards, and if you want to use their service, you’re going to have to give them that information. washingtonpost.com, for example, requires a pretty much identical set of information, on top of a bunch of “email newsletters” and “select advertisers offers”.    Really, this is just in place to put all users of Yahoo! services on the same level, so that users who wish to use more than on service can do so without having to create new accounts, remember multiple passwords and increase the likelihood that users will try out other services offered by Yahoo! and increase their market share. Considering the fact that they spent so much money on acquiring flickr, it’s not such an unreasonable request, really.    And, let’s not forget - every time that discussion of 37s products come along, there are a lot of request for 37s to create a single login for backpack, basecamp, ta-da-lists and whatever else may come along.                                 Dan Hartung            13 Sep 05     Brad’s right — this is just step one on the road to making Flickr just an interface to “Yahoo! Photos”. (Since that’s what they did with Oddpost — chuck its backend in under Yahoo! Mail — I assume something similar will eventually happen.)    That’s not a tragedy, really. Right now (and I’m not a member, just an observer) Flickr’s A+ has merely been downgraded to an A. And Flickr’s featureset is definitely going to live on (indeed, it’s going to become increasingly copied) — so if that’s what you’re there for, I don’t think there’s much to worry about.    If you were there for the indieness, for the community, you’ll probably feel sidelined. I think that’s the signal here.    But it’s not going to slow down the whole Yahoo! Photos strategy — mark my words, in 18 months or so Grandma will be using Yahoo! Photos to tag and stream her digicam output (“My rhodendrons! My great-grandchildren!”). But the unique community that was Flickr will be gone.    Make no mistake, either — the Flickr crew knew all this going into the deal. They’re smart people who saw an opportunity. I don’t begrudge them that, nor do I think they’re having night sweats about the decision. This was an integral, pre-ordained result of the sale of the company.    So what a Flickr type company to do when they do sell to a big bohemoth like Yahoo?    Don’t sell. Have you been reading SvN long?

I think the obvious lesson is, if you sell to a behemoth like Yahoo, you’ll end up with a stupider product.  The ideal situation is to find a way to make a company/service profitable /sustainable without selling yourself to a larger company.

Larry Williams            13 Sep 05     Luckily I signed up before Yahoo acquired Flickr. I was personally not impressed with Flickr after signing up. The user interface is terrible. There seems to be 100 ways of organizing your pictures on 100 different pages. I’ll be looking for something else I think soon. My own hosing would be the best. Does anyone know how to export pictures from Flickr?                                 Stewart Butterfield            13 Sep 05     Some responses (from a Flickr founder):    * It’s no great secret that Yahoo’s registration sucks - we’re working on changing it, but as you can imagine, that is a slow and difficult process. And though it’s easy to imagine that everyone is stupid or clueless, or that that is one evil wizard pulling the strings making things bad, that’s just not the case. It’s complicated, there are a lot of people involved, and there is a lot at stake. It will get better though. (And, though I’m happy to say it sucks, it’s really not “this cruel and unsual signup hell” or “a mountain trek across three state lines” - you guys are just spoiled by good design ;)    * The Yahoo! TOS and privacy policies are much longer and harder to grok, but: (i) in all respects where they differ from the Flickr TOS/PP, they are more restrictive in what we can do and more liberal in what users can do (viz., they are better for users), and (ii) once you get to Yahoo! scale (400m users) I’m not sure if there is any way around language like that: these companies are big tagets for legal action due to their size and the way to achieve precision and a lack of ambiguity in legal prose just doesn’t match with what normal people can understand.   Blame the legal tradition for that one, but it sure has a real impact. Example: people feel like they “can’t trust” Yahoo! because it’s big, but 23people’s completely blank TOS  http://www.23hq.com/23/terms  and about page  http://www.23hq.com/23/about  are OK …    * The majority of net users (in most countries) already have a Yahoo! ID, so for most people, this is much easier: all they have to do is chose a screen name for use on Flickr. Believe it or not, it’s a fact.     * Like Joe Clark and Jeff Croft, I can’t help but agree - Flickr hasn’t changed, other than the signup process. It’s still awesome :) And though we’re spending a lot of our time dealing with massive growth, we are not close to done on the product. It will be bigger, better, faster, funner than ever before.    I’ll leave it to the experts (Dan? ;) to say how it will all come out in the end, but I do know that pretty much everyone I work with at Yahoo! “get’s it” as much as the people posting here. Proofs in the pudding and I’m happy to stand by how things are in 18 months.                                 Larry Williams            13 Sep 05     hosing=hosting ;)                                Chris           13 Sep 05     Yahoo is a big corporation, with lawyers and with groups of staff each of which need their ‘me too’ moment. It needs these lengthy sign-ups to give every single opportunity to grab people into their network. And, as others have written, Flickr is no more. It’s a piece of technology which is now being subsumed into the Yahoo way of thinking.    It’ll happen with all the online entertainment services that News Corp are buying, and it’ll happen to Skype now that eBay have ‘em.    Personally, I can’t stand lengthy signups. It may well be that the next generation of web users, those who will fully appreciate and use Web 2.0 (or n+1) technology, agree, then all might change.                                Paul D           13 Sep 05     “Something that was simple has become complex with no added benefit.”    Add “ridiculously” before “complex” and you have it in a nutshell.    I signed up for Flickr two months ago and found it so useful I bought a pro account. I had been eyeing Flickr for a few weeks beforehand, and the sign-up looked so easy I finally went for it. If I was interested today, that awful Yahoo page would scare me away. I would skip it altogether. I don’t want a fricking Yahoo ID, thank you, and I can do without the frustration of a 3-page sign-up process. People like me are damned tired of the way corporations treat us.                                Paul D           13 Sep 05     “The majority of net users (in most countries) already have a Yahoo! ID, so for most people, this is much easier: all they have to do is chose a screen name for use on Flickr. Believe it or not, it a fact.”    There’s an eight-letter word to describe that statement. The first four are “bull”. More likely, you have lots of people with 4 Yahoo accounts they don’t use or remember because they tried signing up for something like Yahoo Groups (like I did years ago), disliked the experience, and abandoned the account.                                David Heinemeier Hansson           13 Sep 05     Just for the record, this is about the signup process. Not about any other qualities of Flickr. Of course it’s not all gone to hell. Flickr is still great.    What I’m saying is that its a damn shame that the signup process had to go through this frankenstein transformation so soon. Especially if Yahoo is working on making the signup less insane. Why not wait just a little longer until it didn’t hurt this month? Why the rush?    Regarding the TOS, it’s not about what rights the new or the old did or didn’t give. It’s about decrying the loss of a human voice. Just as this whole debate is about the loss of the human touch in language and ordeal around signup.    I have no illusions thinking that Flickr can turn the supertanker that is Yahoo signup around from one day to the next. That’s why its so painful to see that it had to go so damn fast to get Flickr on board of that.    In the end, no one is arguing whether neither Yahoo or Flickr has “the right” to do this. That would be a silly argument. The argument is merely that this is turning people away who aren’t already in Yahoo land (and I certainly don’t recognize the stat that the “majoirty of the net” should be active Yahoo users) and the loss of human welcome for those who do manage to get through it. And if Flickr is to remain the premier destination for online photo sharing, this is not helping.                                Oscar           13 Sep 05     Enough.  Sigining up for Yahoo! is a pain, no doubt. The new Yahoo! IM is intrusive and unfair, as it should ask for what it installs, not for what it does not install.  If you do not have a Yahoo! ID, it is definitelly a pain to sign up for Flickr, above all if that involves retrieving from the depths of your memory that old ID.  But c’mon, if the problem of new Flickr is just the log in, well, it is more difficult, but possible.  And above all, why on earth people do NOT want to have a Yahoo! ID or an e-mail or have access to the network??? I have it but never use it. That’s all.                                Brad           13 Sep 05     Just for the record, this is about the signup process. Not about any other qualities of Flickr.    Sort of agree, although since David started the thread, who am I to say what this is all about.     However, although it may only be specifically about the signup process, it represents bigger issues.    Yahoo has the perception that co-branding (Yahoo Flickr or whatever the new incarnation will be) is better than one name on its own.  Yahoo also seems to have made these changes because it is easier for Yahoo, not necessarily easier for the Flickr users (new or old).    The word  Yahoo  doesn’t mean anything except maybe “Big Internet Company”.  I firmly believe that Flickr would enjoy far more success if Yahoo had hidden its ownership (or shielded) and used its power to promote and market Flickr on it’s own and took advantage of the good will already established.      It’s like when Big Bird (See “Follow that Bird”) from Sesame Street was adopted by the Dodo’s.  He thought it would be great to be in a place with other birds, but in the end they just tried to turn him into a Dodo.    That’s what happening to Flickr, it’s being turned into a Dodo.  Not because any one person is stupid.  I believe Stewart when he says that everyone is working hard and smart.  But I don’t believe that a corporation like Yahoo, with all its layers of bureaucracy and legalese has the confidence or the ability or the agility to lead a company like Flickr with the passion or innovation that Stewart and his wife were able to.  Flickr will be bigger than before, for sure, it will have more members than before, for sure, but it will be like McDonalds compared to the trendy bistro.                                 Martin            13 Sep 05     My summary of the two sign-up pages:    OLD: Provide us with the bare minimum to use the service.    NEW: Additional fields for advertising purpose only: gender, birthday, first and last name, zip code,industry, specialisation, title    It is about the feel of it. It feels like you got into an iterrogation. I think David is right, it lost the human touch (“come, get in”), the user is now treated like something to be squeezed out.    No doubt, the yahoo marketing department is constantly demanding more “knowledge” about its users to offer more “targeted” advertisement. And default subscription to yahoo mail so the numbers look good.                                  Arthur Hodgkiss           13 Sep 05     > Flickr would enjoy far more success if Yahoo had hidden   > its ownership (or shielded) and used its power to promote  > and market Flickr    Couldn’t agree more. Talk about destruction. The Flickr admins tell us it’s going to be all right, but I’m not optimistic.    Luckily, I have a few spare non-Pro accounts already set up, so I can hopefully avoid having to login to Flahoo as fluffy_bunny_90210 - for the time being at least.                                A Nonnie Moose           13 Sep 05     Speaking of inane registration processes…   https://www.google.com/accounts/SmsMailSignup1                                Jordan Roher           13 Sep 05     Of course, the flipside to all this is that if you have a Yahoo! ID and want to sign up for Flickr, you just type in your password, pick a Flickr nickname, and you’re done.  You can go from Yahoo! user to Flickr member in the same amount of time it takes to use the old sign up form (or at least I did).    I’m still wondering why the Flickr community is so up in arms about all this.  So now they have to sign up for a Yahoo! account.  Did Yahoo! change any of Flickr’s policies or prices?  Has the site functionality changed?  Is there more intrusive advertizing?  Or is this akin to Mac users complaining that the appearance of their still totally usable and breathtakingly intuitive programs changes slightly on each revision?                                 Fathead            13 Sep 05     I hate Yahoo with a passion, but I never let it get in the way of business. I never use the email address, so that’s not a problem. I only sign up for what I want when I really want it bad. Yahoo sucks in bulk but I’m not scared to use ‘em and abuse ‘em. I don’t have to read their ads and I get what I want. When it gets too hard, I’ll dump them no problem.                                 Utter Doul            13 Sep 05     Your post pointed me to 23hq and I noticed that though in their FAQ they say the free account has 15MB monthly quota, on signing up, the upload page says I have a 1024MB quota. Just FYI.                                 Kim Siever            13 Sep 05     Well, this now explains why none of my family have signed up when I’ve invited them to join. I guess I joined Flickr early enough to avoid all that.                                 test            13 Sep 05     ttest                                 Bryan C            13 Sep 05     C’mon, guys. It’s not that bad, and it’s way overblown to suggest that flickr is ruined. It is a useless and divisive and stupid change, however, and I hope that Stewart and friends are doing their best to drum that in at Yahoo.     And it seems like a solution would be simple. Have a staged signup. where the basic three-questions and the bot protection field are required for access. The other stuff can wait until later, maybe when people put in their payment information to buy prints or whatever. Or offer some kind of incentive (more storage?) for users who want to give more information. This is the way things work in the real world, so why not online?    But what companies need to realize is that that information is utterly and completely useless. Users put in false information wherever they can. They’ll check any checkbox, hit any submit button, and gleefully ignore any TOS because they know everyone else does the same. The only thing you can trust is what the user cares about, which is damn little. Everything else is a WOMBAT - a Waste Of Money, Brains And Time. While the corporate types imagine they’re collecting lucrative information it’s really a false metric of success that only encourages harmful policies.                                 dusoft            13 Sep 05     Yahoo ID! is awful thing. It is user unfriendly, it want so many information from you, I gave the signing up up lot of times, yet. Those have been many times when someone asked me to either join yahoo group or so and I refused because of this absolutely unusable yahoo ID!    Usable web will continue… but without YahooID! in its current form.    And “bullshit” is certainly the word used for describing YahooID! as having the most users in the world (or most of the users).

Is there no end to the things one can learn from SvN? :-)                                 todd            13 Sep 05     https://login.yahoo.com/config/login?.src=flkctx&.pc=5134&.done=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.yahoo.com%2Fconfig%2Fvalidate%3F.src%3Dflkctx%26.pc%3D5134%26.done%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fsignin%252Fyahoo%252F    This page is yahoo-ed too,,   Although it appears they tried to spice it up with some pretty lame lines - which somehow are obviously not written by anyone at Flickr, but instead someone at Yahoo.   When I saw this page I knew things were not going in the right direction.                                Kristopher Tillery           13 Sep 05     Despite what one might think after reading these comments, the Yahoo! brand is recognized and well-regarded in the United States and overseas.  I think that this is a supposition that can be generally accepted based on market research (http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_14/b3927419_mz079.htm as an example that can be found in ~10 seconds of searching; there are many more exhaustive studies that elude to this point).    Accepting the above supposition and explicitly separating the echnocratfrom the verageperson or the erson-at-largeon the internet, it becomes increasingly clear why Flickr (and the Flickr community) benefits from a Yahoo! network sign in, independent of the complexity that the new process adds.      The “average” or “non-technical” user was unlikely to be familiar with the Flickr brand or the “techie wit” that accompanied Flickr’s original sign in message.  To him/her, this familiarity in tone and lack of corporate affiliation might be disconcerting: one can easily imagine an “average” user confusing Flickr for some kind of college class project.  By associating the Flickr brand with the Yahoo! brand during the sign in process, “average” users are more likely to see the service as a mainstream, commercial option for photo sharing.  Thus, they may be equally willing to complete a more complex sign in process given the added benefit of a certain “brand security./p>   What, though, does this mean for the internet “technocrat”?  For him/her, the added inconvenience signals the death of the Flickr brand independent from its parent; this is in some sense unavoidable if Flickr is to broaden its audience target.  However, I would argue that the benefits derived from the Yahoo!-Flickr association outweigh the inconveniences driven by Yahoo! ownership because in the long term the Flickr community-at-large benefits greatly from a more diverse network of photos and members regardless of what happens to the Flickr brand.  Searching for photos flagged with the term “apple” will no longer return only images of the next greatest iPod; a search such as this might display images of a neighbor garden or a family’s trip to the orchard.  While this example is trivial, it reflects an important strength that Yahoo! has brought / will bring to the Flickr service: greater diversity in opinion and viewpoint.                                 Jill            13 Sep 05     I don’t like Yahoo.  The over all vibe seems pretty uncreative, unimaginative and unremarkable.  Their products are hard to use.  I don’t think the average person likes stuff that’s mediocre.  I don’t think this is a technocrat vs. average user thing.  I’m not a technocrat.  I’m just a girl with a Yahoo store. (Which I’m in the process of shutting down because it’s clunky and hard to use and yucky looking.)    Flickr still seems to be okay, though, for the most part.                                YahooRules!           13 Sep 05     Are you all upset that Flickr is more interested in getting money from Yahoo than your $24?                                 N8K99            13 Sep 05     I used to be able to bulk load an entire set of photographs to flickr.com and still use my cellphone to post photos to my blog. Now with the corporate Yahoo buyout, the drive to purchase the $24 account prohibits me from doing that. I did like it better when they were really free!                                 Brad           13 Sep 05     Kristopher Tillery: Despite what one might think after reading these comments, the Yahoo! brand is recognized and well-regarded in the United States and overseas.    That’s not the point.  I disagree with the premise of your argument.  That popularity can translate from one realm to another.  No doubt they will probably get bigger given Yahoo’s user base, but not nearly as big as they could have gotten if Yahoo would have kept Flickr as Flickr instead of turning it into Yahoo Flickr.      It is loosing what made it Flickr and turning into what makes Yahoo Yahoo.  Sure we are only talking about the sign up and sure the founders will try hard to keep the original flare, but it’s gone and grown up and been bought out.    Instead of standing on it’s own as the premier site for hosting your pictures it has now been swalled by Yahoo and has become yet another service of the behemoth.  It’s inevitable and it’s sad.  I’m crying.  I’m wallowing in my tears.  I’m actually wishing i was the one with the millions in my pocket from the sale.                                 Derek            13 Sep 05     If the Flickr signup procedure hadn’t changed, but it got you a Yahoo! ID instead, I think a lot fewer people would have been upset at the ID unification plan. But given how byzantine the new scheme is, they have got to be losing signups now. Here’s what I just wrote to Flickr via their feedback form:    http://www.flickr.com/help/website/#7    ——-    So, how do you respond to Jason at 37Signals?    http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/flickr_signup_from_human_to_droid_in_a_yahoo_moment.php    I’ve pointed several people to Flickr recently, and half of them gave up trying to sign up when they had to go through the Yahoo! procedure. That never happened before with your old signup.    I even signed up a friend myself because she’d just gotten married and was on honeymoon. I already _know_ how cool Flickr is, and I almost gave up setting up her account because of the Yahoo! signup hassle.    You have _got_ to do something. It’s fine to unify Flickr and Yahoo! IDs. But make signing up from Flickr as convenient as it used to be, even if you’re getting a Yahoo! ID in the process. Please oh please.                                 Stewart Butterfield            14 Sep 05     Derek, you can see how we respond if you scroll up. (And it was David, not Jason.)                                 Kyle           14 Sep 05     Alright, so the sign up is a bit abusive.  As a Pro Flickr user (from pre-Yahoo days) I really don’t understand the broo-ha-ha over the switch to Yahoo IDs.  It makes sense, it means I have one less username and password to remember, it ties Flickr into my other Yahoo services, and it generally makes life easier for me as a user.  Some people are just getting really silly about this change.                                 Frank            14 Sep 05     Interesting article about a rival fotoblogging site.                                 Kevin Cheng           14 Sep 05     Joshua said:   Did Yahoo! change any of Flickr policies or prices?     Yep they did. They made it cheaper and as Stewart said, more liberal to the user.                                Kristopher Tillery           14 Sep 05     Brad,    Thanks for the response to my previous comment.  However, I am a bit lost in regard to your assertion that Flickr could have grown even larger without the Yahoo! user base.    It seems that the real UED problem is not applicable to people who already hold a Yahoo! account (although I personally signed up pre-Yahoo! and thus can’t confirm that porting an existing Yahoo! ID to Flickr is painless). Thus, Flickr immediately benefits from access to and visibility among nearly 400MM people to whom this problem does not apply.    I just don’t see that data to support the assertion that Flickr would have grown larger without the Yahoo! user base.  Unfortunately, we both passed into hypotheticals so I am afraid there is no real test either way.  This would, though, make an interesting design lab experiment: mock-up a service and issue two versions (one with a corporate partner brand ad another independent).  Then, track the sign up patterns of users in a controlled environment where you can change one variable at a time (i.e. reduce subscription price on corporate-owned site, etc.)                                JC           14 Sep 05     Yahoo sign up screens and log in interface design has always been complete crap.  I’ve lost track of the number of times I have abandoned anything I wanted info on when I was caught in the yahoo trap. Typically, I miss one of the fields (easy to do) and when I click back, all or some of what I entered is missing. A realm pain! And thier obsession with passwords constantly is nuts. So I pretty much have avoided Yahoo with much pasion.  Now that Flickr is absorbed into that horid domain, I’ll probably avoid it too.                                 anil            14 Sep 05     Some more thoughts on the Flickr acquisition on my  blog . Personally, i’m of the view that a successful startup should seek commercial partnerships over acquisition.     Flickr is a social network. Social networks do not generally survive acquisition. At least i don’t know of any that have come through intact.                                Brad           14 Sep 05     Kristopher Tillery    I’m not saying they would have grown bigger without Yahoo’s user base, I’m saying they should have leveraged their user base and their deep pockets to market Flickr (among their user base and beyond) as Flickr, rather than as a service of Yahoo (Yahoo Photo’s, Yahoo Groups, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Flickr).    By cobranding (read: Melting Flickr into Yahoo) they are lessening the value of both Yahoo and Flickr.      What is Yahoo?  Who knows.      What was Flickr then?  Really cool social photo albums.  Period.    What is Flickr now?  Really cool pictures, a portal to Yahoo, a cross-selling mechanism to get new Yahoo users, a way to introduce people to other Yahoo services.      Yahoo is Walmart.  Walmart makes lots of money and has tonnes of customers.  People know what Walmart is and what it is not.    Flickr will change and become less like Flickr and more like Yahoo.  That is good for Yahoo, bad for Flickr.                                 david gunnells            14 Sep 05     @ Stewart: good luck getting the Yahoo signup crap down in size and obtusenes! the sooner, the better!     as a pro user (using flickr since summer ‘04), I’m not sold on the idea of being forced to create a yahoo id that is associated w/ my flickr account, especially considering I’ve paid for a pro account through summer of ‘07.    granted, all the info that I used to pay for the account is now sitting on a yahoo server somewhere (I guess) and there’s probably nothing I can do about that…but the forced yahoo id thing doesn’t make sense to me. if I wanted a yahoo ID, I’ll get one. if I wanted a flickr account, same thing. I don’t need both.    I agree w/ a few earlier posts of witnessing family/friends pass over signing up for flickr since the yahoo ID (fiasco?) and I didn’t realize what the deal was until one of them told me about the ridiculously long signup procedure, which I didn’t have to go through last year…    here’s to optimism and a few pints of Guinness to remind me that this is still just a silly point of discussion in the end.

Really cool pictures, a portal to Yahoo, a cross-selling mechanism to get new Yahoo users, a way to introduce people to other Yahoo services. “    What you’re saying is just plainly false - it’s not like we both have opinions about it and they are different: you are saying things that are incorrect.    Not sure if you’ve used Flickr before, but it is not “social photo albums” (and was not). And now it is not “a cross-selling mechanism to get new Yahoo users” - it’s the same as it was, except people use Yahoo! IDs for authentication. Yahoo could care less about a few hundred thousand people getting Yahoo! IDs.

It's the sequel to the  original Intelligence Toilet , which has been tracking and graphing the health of the 10,000 or so lucky souls who have purchased one since 2005, according to Toto. Like the original, the  Intelligence Toilet II  takes all kinds of readings from your urine, which are then organized into Wii Fit style charts and graphs on your PC via Wi-Fi. It's unclear what all is new aside from the aforementioned temperature monitoring, which can help women keep track of their menstruation cycles, but if you're going to import a crazy Japanese toilet, this is clearly the one.

Thanks again to Matt for taking the time to answer these and Bobby for arranging it all for us. Sadly Erik was unavailable to provide input to this Q&A session so Bobby Stickel from Privateer has added some of his responses to your questions.   How does this game change Privateer Press? Going forward will this game be an impetus to move PP into being more like WotC?   Matt Wilson : I dont think its possible for Privateer Press to be anything like WotC, at least not from a business stand-point, which I think is what is being implied here. For one, Wizards of the Coast is owned by a very big corporation  Hasbro  which is publicly traded and has a board of directors, etc. Privateer Press is privately held, independent and solvent, answering to no one but our customers. So, the comparison really cant be made.    What Monsterpocalypse will do to Privateer Press is allow us to grow, acquire new talent, make more great games and expand on the existing brands the way we have always wanted to.   Any details that you can give us regarding the first expansion for the game?   Bobby : Heres what I can say at this point& When it comes to our games, we like to say go Big or go home. I can also tell you that its being designed on an Apple computer. Seriously, its targeted for Spring of 2009, but well have more details and spoilers very soon.

This final set of questions deals with Rackham as a company and some technical aspects of running the company and developing their games.   I’d like to thank Jean for taking the time to answer the questions that we sent to him (and it was a significant number :-) and also thank those who took the time to send in their questions.   About Rackham    What effect the change from a private to a public firm has made in the way that Rackham creates their games and figures?    Objectively, none at all. It is up to us to be reliable. I owe results to our partners and the share holders who trusted us when they invested in Rackham and who renewed their trust during this difficult period of transition. I also owe it to our customers who have been supporting us by purchasing our games and miniatures.

Are GW players your target audience, or do you plan to break out and do heroes stylized to fit other games, other races or perhaps even come up with your own unique heroes?   My intention is my target audience being every miniatures gamer and collector.  It is true that due to my sculpting style, my figures specially attract GW players, which is something I am very proud of, as I believe GW already provides them with a really wide and high quality range of figures.   What games do you play and how does this influence your contract/ personal sculpting projects?   I have played a lot of games. I like saying that more than a sculptor I am a gamer who sculpts. I currently play Hordes, Warhammer and RPGs when I find the opportunity to.

Here are his responses.   One of the more possibly interesting questions was actually far too long to include but it might be an interesting jumping off point to talk about the brutality of the 40K setting. Its a rather  long comment by spooktalker  at this URL. I think the direct answer is that no-one wants escapist literature that is as brutal as the real-world but there is an interesting disconnect, I think, between the 40K setting itself and the types of books that get produced for it. Why do we want to read literature in a setting that seems to be antithetical to the notion of a hero?   Interesting point there (I went and read the thread). I would argue that 40K fiction is quite spectacularly brutal, and often shows the atrocious extremes of the Imperial regime. It is a particularly dark, callous and totalitarian place, where life is miserably cheap. However, I would find it pretty relentless if that’s all there was. Characters like Gaunt and Eisenhorn provide, I hope, points of reference in the gothic madness, sharing our horror or disgust at things. I’d like to think that even in the far future where there is only war, some human beings will still attempt to be decent and honourable.

Due to some overly sensitive spam filters our original questions didn’t make it to Jervis but we were able to rectify that problem and Jervis quickly sent along his answers to your questions.    Thanks very much to Jervis for taking time to answer these questions and also for getting them back to us so quickly.

Thanks to everyone who posted a question and thanks again to Matt for taking the time to answer these for us.   Are there plans for a novel line or a compilation of short stories?   Let’s say we’re in the preliminary stages of plans. Are we going to produce novelized fiction? Yes. Currently, we are determining the best way to produce this fiction and get it out to the readers. So, this isn’t an official announcement that it’s coming, but our hope is to be able to see something on the shelves in 2008.

The entire 70+minute interview was recorded and I’ve finally managed to get the first 30 minutes of it processed and ready for download.

Originally a 3D modeler and texture artist, he switched over 2D art and is now a widely recognized digital artist.  He has worked on several titles at Electronic Arts, and is currently heading up the concept art team at Propaganda Games. In addition he does freelance work for many clients, including Privateer Press. As Daryl’s art is such a prominent part of the Hordes game we thought we’d ask him a few questions about himself, working for Privateer Press and art.

We recently became aware of  TeacherTube , which is a video sharing site that has become a workaround for educators who can't access YouTube videos on the web. Many schools may block YouTube, but allow access to TeacherTube because it's an educational resource.

By leelefever on August 10, 2005 - 9:53am. 2 comments      Categories:  humor interview news        I really enjoyed reading the BBC  interview with Tim Berners-Lee .  But, I was in awe at how Mark Lawson kept trying to get him to say that he felt responsible for the bad elements of the web...   But do you feel responsible? You say humanity will do whatever it does with it, do you feel responsible for what happens?  You must reflect though on the law of unintended consequences because it wasn't remotely ever your intention when you started on this that so much of the web would be given over to sexual exhibitionists masturbating in their bedrooms with webcams. Do you ever have bad moments about that?

Jim           Hello Mike,       Was on your site today actually and am very impressed how much it has grown!        You only had about 15 companies when I sent mine in!        I like how you update within 24 hours, that's great, not every 6 mos like some.        You put a lot of energy into your site and it shows!        I'm sure it's pretty much a full time job but it's so great to see someone doing such a good job.        Everyone appreciates it!        Shar           Mike-   Just wanted to say your website is awesome and very helpful.         Thanks for that-        regards,       Ryan           Mike,       Your new site is excellent.

I know a lot of new-hire pilots who owe you a    great debt of gratitude.       Keep up the good work!!       Mahalo Nui Loa,       Alan           The new site is great.       I like it a lot better than the old site.         Thanks !!       Steve           Hi Mike,       I really appreciate the e-updates on the aviation industry.        Unfortunately, maybe fortunately,    I was recalled to active duty as part of a security force.       I'm living in another country for the next year or two, depending on the manpower needs.        The closest airport is about three hours away.        It may be hard for me to accumulate hours while I'm in the ""recall status.""       Please keep sending the e-updates.        The information is very useful.       Proudly Serving,       Bill           Mike,       You're doing a great job.       Bill           mike-       how are you?        i just wanted to let you know that your website is very helpful and informative.        i will certainly recommend it to anyone i know who is wanting to interview with an airline.        i am currently working on my cfi to build my hours, and as soon as i can get an interview,    i will certainly post my interview experiences.        keep up the good work.       thanks,       ed           Mike,       I just wanted to write you a quick note to thank you for the service that you do for pilots.        I am a young pilot with a little over 1000hours TT and I am overwhelmed with interviews    and what to study for interviews.        I have found the gouges to be very helpful!       Thanks       Marty           Your work is greatly appreciated, and your attitude is what we all need to get through    this difficult time.        Thanks and have a Merry Christmas!       Frank           Keep up the great work and have a great 2002!!        Fly safe and often!!        Erik           Thanks again for the emails and the website...       it is greatly appreciated...       I am learning alot since I am in flight training and with all the info received at your    site I will one day succeed in becoming a regional airline pilot...       Sincerely,       Dimitrios           Hey Mike,       Thank you for updating the information on the interview gouges.        I believe what comes around goes around.        Someone helped me out and I hope the info I gave can benefit others.        Keep in touch!       James           Mike, thanks for your efforts!..        they're much appreciated by me..        Dan           Thank you for this website.        You have provided a priceless assistance for my worksearch.        Although I was not hired by either Airtran or EJA, I would not have been prepared for    their interviews.            Every now and again you run into a web site that you really helps you out.         I'm a CFII who's now hell bent on getting my ME time together so I can join the interview    scene in the spring.         Not only does your site give me the scoop on what I need to be studying, but it also    lets me know how much time I need to be competitive.         Thanks for doing such a great job.       Regards,       Christopher            Hey Mike just wanted to say a quick thanks for the updates and keeping such a great and    helpful site running.         For alot of us flight instructors who are just trying to get our foot in the door and are    living on instructor wages can't afford to pay for a site like this, I can speak for    myself a quite a few of my friends when I say we really do appreciate it.              Mike,       I would just like to say thanks for creating and offering what has become the best    gouge/interview site available.         You have surpassed other sites (namely Will Fly for Food), and as a furloughed pilot right    now inches away from an interview with ChiEx, I've been visiting your site regularly   - and it seems as if there is always something new.           Mike,       Great job, I appreciate all the information.        Rex            Great site.        Thanks for not only putting it together but for updating and upgrading it often.        The e-mail alerts are very helpful.           Hi MIKE        U are doing a gr8 job KEEP IT.        Happy Landings        Khalid            Hey Mike, excellent site.        Thank you for your efforts and the time you have taken to make it the best site I've been to.         I will surely let my aviation friends know about it and I will post after I interview.           Mike,       I love the website that you have put together.        I have recomended it to most of my fellow pilots.......most of which have not heard of it yet.       Thanks Again       Christian            Thanks for the update Mike.        The site is now working great.        I have an interview in three weeks.        I'll let everyone know how it went.        Thanks for putting together a great site!        John            I've never mentioned it but I just wanted to say thanks for setting up this site.        It feels good to know that with interviews getting started again things may look    positive somtime soon.       Roger           Thank you for all your work on the website.         Hopefully I will be going to somje interviews soon and will be able to send some POSITIVE    experiences back.       Duffy            Mike,        I just want to say this is a great web sight and you    are doing a great job.       Neil           Thanks for setting up your website.........I have an interview with ASA. The only gouge I've    been able to find that's up to date is on your website, so THANKS!!!!!!     I'll be sure to send in my experience after it's all over.   Thanks again!           Dear Mike:   Just a note of thank you to you for all of your inspiration these past few months.     You have been a positive influence for me during these tough times!       I got an email from the Usairways Commuter saying I may have a definite class date by this Wednesday!     I will keep you posted.         Thanks so much!           I think your web site is great and very helpful to those of us trying achieve to ultimate goal of being hired.     As of today, I personally have not had any problems loging in or obtaining the information you generate.     Once again, thanks for the free access to such valuable information.            I think your website is wonderful, and you are doing an excellent job of helping your fellow pilots advance their careers.     Keep up the good work.       Michael           Thanks for the great site and all the updates...    You're doing a great job and I'm sure everyone appreciates it!!    Kepp up the great work and fly SAFE!!!       Erik            Thanks for the information and for what it is worth, I would pay for a site this good.        I probably would not have gotten the job I have now had it not been for the information from this site.        Keep up the good work and best of luck!       Paul           I'd like to thank you for putting out such a helpful web-site,        it has been a great help in keeping current on what's going on in the airline industry, as slow as it may be.       Mike           Thanks so much for this site.       It really is a big help.           Thanks for the great site.         I understand the need for $$ support.         I'm getting ready to apply once again for several commuters.         I appreciate the excellent gouge and related info.         Keep up the good work.         Scott            Thanks much for all the work you've put into the site.         When I get hired at a regional, I'll be sure to post my experience.         As a starving flight instructor and pilot,        I do enjoy things that are for free,        and hope the pay-for-access doesn't apply to me or doesn't end up costing too much.         Thanks again,       Chris           Thank you very much for the info!        Excellent job you are doing for us job hungry pilots.           Mike,       Thanks for all the work you've put in, to make this website successful.        It is truly a great help to anyone going for an interview.       Thanks Again       Christian           Dear Sir,       Thanks.  Your service is great.         I am about to retire from the Army as a UH-60 pilot with over 4000 hours, commercial instrument rotary wing, and will finish my commercial mutli-engine in the next two months.         I can not wait to start interviewing for my next career.       Thanks for providing a great benefit to me and many others       Ronnie           Mike,       Just wanted to say thank you for your website....       If you didn't have it, I would have fallen flat on my face at the ASA interview....it helped greatly....       moreover, I'm telling everyone who has an interview about your site...       Which is quite alot with all the furloughs going on.         Again, thank you very much!!!!       Sincerely,       Mark           Just wanted to say thank you for helping us all out.         This msg board really is a great help.           Thank you for having the best aviation employment site on the web.         I just got a job on the ERJ 145.         The gouge was dead on.         Airinc was a complete waste of money.           I just wanted to thank you for the wonderful information presented on this site.        It has given my fellow pilots and I a great resource and abundance of information in    preparing for aviaiton interviews for a number of different companies.       You should be very proud of what you have composed.       Any comments back would be greatly appreciated.       Thank You Very Much,       Jeff           Hi Mike,       Thanks for all the great info.         I know me and the other low time guys/gals can have a better chance at getting a job becuase of your site.         Not to mention it being free, for a CFI this is the best in the world!!!                 Send me your feedback!
