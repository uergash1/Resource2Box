Their oldest traditions are steeped in methodical                  work in the fields.                  It was working the land that the Milanese put to use both the                  technique of the tenacious Certosini monks and the hydraulic inventions                  of  Leonardo da Vinci , who lived as a guest of                  the Sforza family for many years (1482-1513) and bequeathed the                  city with precious practical knowledge such as designs for irrigation                  methods in agriculture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           excerpt from page                        61                                                                                                                                                                            In the 15th century the Dominican church                  and convent of  Santa Maria delle Grazie                   was outside the medieval walls of Milan. It was in its refectory                  that, between 1495 and 1497, Leonardo painted                                                                                                                                                The Last Supper                                                     Along with the  Monna Lisa  at the Paris Louvre,  The Last                  Supper  is Leonardo's most famous work. It is one of the paintings                  most often taken as  a symbol of Western Art . It depicts                  the instant in which Jesus announces to the apostles that he knows                  one of them will betray him. Thanks to the sense of perspective                  the painting conveyed, the monks eating in the refectory almost                  had the impression they were part of the scene.                                                                      The sense of awe inspired by this masterpiece                  and the profound interest in it stem also from the enormous problems                  that its conservation has always presented. When Leonardo da Vinci                  painted  The Last Supper  he employed a technique different                  from the traditional one used to paint wall frescoes. The traditional                  technique was to divide the section of wall to be frescoed into                  small squares to be painted rapidly one at a time, while the plaster                  was still moist, so that the paint and the plaster would dry together.                  Leonardo chose a technique which resembled the one commonly employed                  to paint on canvas or on wood. This allowed him to paint more                  than once over the same surface, so that he could retouch details                  and thereby achieve the end result he had in mind.                  This method did permit Leonardo to create a wall painting of extraordinary                  beauty. Unfortunately, it is also exceptionally vulnerable because                  the color painted on dry plaster did not stick as well as it would                  have done on moist plaster and is all the more perishable.                  When this initial setback is added to the refectory's natural                  humidity, to the settling of the wall that supports the painting,                  causing cracks, and to the inevitable damage caused by the mere                  passage of hundreds of years... you will certainly understand                  why the conservation of  The Last Supper  gives rise to such                  heartfelt controversy.                                                                                                                                                                                                          Cadorna Triennale                                                                                          reopened after complete restoration                  on May 28, 1999                  open 9AM - 7PM;                                    Sunday 9AM - 8PM                  • closed Monday                                    Lire 14,000, credit cards not accepted (free for under 18 and                  senior citizens over 60)                                    visits must be booked by phone ([+39] 02 89421146) and last                  15 mins                                                                                                                                  •                                                                   Details                                                                                                                                                                                  All rights reserved                                                     copyright © 1996-2003                  Monica Levy, Roberto Peretta                  copyright © 1996, 2002                  Ulrico Hoepli SpA, Milano                                                                                                                                                        [Want to  purchase                 the guidebook ?]                [Instructions on  how                to  do it]                                                                                                                                                                                           what you find pp 3-48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                what you find                          pp 49-96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                what you find                          pp 97-144                                                                                                                                                                                                                            what you find                          pp 145-212                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "

Painted by Leonardo for Duke Ludovico Sforza and his duchess Beatrice d’Este in the late 15th century, the scene represents  The Last Supper  from the final days of Jesus’s life, as narrated in the Gospel of John 13:21, when Jesus announces that one of his  Twelve apostles  would betray him.   Most visitors are intrigued by the complicated (and problematic) technique that Leonardo used in painting the scene: instead of painting on wet plaster as is usual in the creation of a fresco, the artist painted on a dry wall, sealing the stone with pitch, gesso, and mastic, and then painting on the sealing layer with tempera. As is commonly known, Leonardo’s invented technique did not work very well — it’s a conservator’s nightmare– and within a few years of completion it had already begun showing signs of deterioration.   Other visitors admire the fresco for its psychological expressions. The painting specifically portrays the reaction given by each apostle when Jesus said one of them would betray him. All twelve apostles have different reactions to the news, with various degrees of anger and shock.   Now, with the publication of a new study by art historian John Varriano in the journal  Gastronomica , visitors paying homage to  The Last Supper  can lick their lips as gaze upon the seder meal on the Leonardo’s painted table for Varriano has figured out what Jesus and his apostles are eating.   Varriano explains why scholars have commonly assumed that lamb must be the main course:   the event takes place at Passover, a time when lamb would normally be served, but scripture is silent on the menu for this particular seder. Apart from Matthew (26:20), who notes that the dinner took place in the evening, and Mark (14:15) and Luke (22:12), who add that it was held in a large room upstairs, already furnished, the biblical account could hardly be less informative when it comes to the meal itself   However, close examination of the painting made possible because of extensive restoration done in 1997 has shown that the meal was a bit fishier:   There are three large serving platters in the picture, and although the one in front of Christ is empty, the two before Andrew and Matthewthe fourth figures to his right and leftare heaped with food. The plate to our left appears to contain about half a dozen whole fish, while the one on the right is damaged to the point of being all but illegible. Fortunately, the preservation of the three small serving dishes on the right side of the composition is sufficiently good to suggest that we are looking at, in fact, sections of grilled eel garnished with orange slices.

It also plays a key role in Dan Brown's conspiracy-driven religious mythology, but most readers of  The Da Vinci Code  don't seem to realize the degree to which Brown misrepresents the painting - perhaps due to their own religious and artistic illiteracy.   Leonardo Da Vinci was an artist and as such depended upon artistic conventions. The convention was for Judas to be seated opposite the others and with his back to the viewer; here Judas is seated on the same side of the table as the others. Another absent convention was to place halos over the heads of everyone but Judas. Leonardo's painting is thus more humanistic and less religious than most: Judas the betrayer is as much a part of the group as anyone, and everyone in the group is equally human rather than saintly and holy. This reflects Leonardo's humanistic and artistic beliefs, a strong mark against anyone trying to misuse the work in grand religious conspiracy theories.   We must also understand the scriptural sources of the Last Supper. Leonardo's immediate source is John 13:21, when Jesus announces that a disciple will betray him. It is also supposed to be a depiction of the origin of the communion ritual, but scripture is conflicted on what really happened. Only Corinthians is explicit in requiring that followers repeat the ritual, for example, and only only Matthew mentions that this is done for the forgiveness of sins.   These were not news reports: just as communion differs from one denomination to the next today, it differed among early Christian communities. Local customizing of religious rituals was normal and common, so what Da Vinci is portraying is his artistic interpretation of one community's localized communion liturgy, not a news report of historical events.   Dan Brown uses the scene for it's relationship to the Holy Grail, even though John doesn't mention bread or a cup. Brown somehow concludes that the absence of a cup means the Holy Grail must be something other than a cup: the disciple John, who is really Mary Magdalene. This is no more improbable than the orthodox Christian story, but it is an almost willful misrepresentation that is believed when people don't understand the artistic and religious sources.

clueweb09-enwp01-26-04787	"                     List of paintings by Leonardo da Vinci          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                  The Last Supper       This is a  list of paintings attributed to  Leonardo da Vinci , (baptised Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci) (   pronunciation   ( help  info ) ), ( April 15 ,  1452    May 2 ,  1519 ), one of the leading artists of the  High Renaissance . Fifteen works are generally attributed either in whole or in large part to him, most of them paintings on panel but including a mural, a large drawing on paper and two works in the early stages of preparation. A further six paintings are disputed, there are four recently attributed works, and two are copies of lost work. None of Leonardo's paintings are signed, and this list draws on the opinions of various scholars. [ 1 ]   The small number of surviving paintings is due to Leonardo's constant and frequently disastrous experimentation with new techniques, and his chronic procrastination. Nevertheless, these few works together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, comprise a contribution to later generations of artists rivaled only by that of his contemporary,  Michelangelo .

[ 2 ]  It is generally considered that Leonardo also painted much of the background landscape and the torso of Christ. One of Leonardo's earliest extant works. Vasari's statement that the angel on the left is by Leonardo is confirmed by studies by  Bode , Seidlitz and Guthman, and accepted by McCurdy, Wasserman and others.

The work was traditionally attributed to Verrocchio until 1869. It is now almost universally attributed to Leonardo. Attribution proposed by Liphhart, accepted by Bode, Lubke, Muller-Walde,  Berenson ,  Clark , Goldscheider and others.

The anatomy of the Christ Child is so poor as to discourage firm attribution by most critics while some believe that it is a work of Leonardo's youth. This attribution was made by Suida in 1929. Other art historians such as Shearman and Morelli attribute the work to Verrocchio. [ 1 ]  Daniel Arasse discusses this painting as a youthful work in  Leonardo da Vinci , (1997).

Early 20th-century scholars were vociferous in their disagreement, but most current critics accept both the authorship and the identity of the sitter.

Several gods and goddesses were connected with music and      dance and the very word music comes from the                 Nine Muses  of ancient Greece. They were the course of      inspiration for all artists and even today many artists speak of      their Muse.       We also have many musical terms from the Greek language:      harmony, melody, tune, choir, orchestra, chromatic, scene, lyre,      hymn, psalm, rhythm.          A common question young Greeks ask one another is ""Do you listen      to Greek or foreign music?"". They separate the two, and even      though you can like both, it is more often one or the other.      During its long journey through the ages the Greek music adapted      elements from the Romans, the Byzantium and later from the      Renaissance. In the 19th century the Greek musing is moving      forward with composers like Nikolaos Mantzaros (the composer of      the Greek National Anthem) and Spyridon Samaras the composer of      the Olympic anthem, both of those composers where from the      Ionian islands. The Ionian islands beeing closer to Italy had      affections from the Italian serenades those serenades later      became the so called ""Kantades"" of Athens of the beginning of      the 20th century. Until the 30's those songs together with the      Operettas like 'O Vaftistikos' of the composer Theofrastos      Sakelarides and the songs of Kleon Triantafylou who was known as      Attic where the most popular for the urban population of Athens      mainly. Attic was also the creator of the famous ""Mantra tou      Attic"" one of the first repertory troupes in Greece.       During the early 50s the Greek music, or certainly what you      could hear in the mass media of radio and films, was the Laika      (music based on the bouzouki) with sounds that the Greeks from      Asia Minor brought with them back in the 1920s. The Greek soft      music (elafra mousiki) with flavours of western European sounds,      the most representative of which came from the songs of Manos      Hadjidakis and Mimis Plessas that was sung by famous performers      like Nana Moushouri, Tzeni Vanou, Giannis Vogiatzis and others,      was also very popular. Also, during this time, the music of      famous duos and trios like the Katsamba Brothers and Trio Athena      became fashionable. Their particular sound was an imitation of      Spanish and Mexican music which they transformed into Greek. ,      As well as this, there was the other kind of music, the Demotica      or Greek folk music which unfortunately negative memories for      many older Greeks as Demotica was promoted as Greek nationalist      music during the seven years under the dictatorship. Hopefully,      as the years have gone by, these bad connotations are beginning      to fade.              Laika developed from the Rebetika which was popular among the      underclasses during the 1940s and 1950s. It was not well known      to the masses until around the 1970s when George Dalaras and      many others reproduced many old Rebetica songs. This coincided      with the making of the famous Greek film, Rebetico (that tells      the story of Marika Ninou one of the first rebetiko woman      singers) which popularised this kind of music even more. The      Laika was, for many years, neglected by the Greek middle class.      It is said that it was Manolis Hiotis who brought the bouzouki      music into the middle-class drawing room. Manolis Hiotis was      probably the best virtuoso of the bouzouki though he was a      former guitarist, he also invented the eight string bouzouki and      created unforgettable songs using for the first time in modern      Greek pop music the styles of Jazz, Samba and many Latin music      elements integrated with his bouzouki.              From the end of the 1950s onwards, the Greek Laika became more      and more popular. This is partly to do with the economic      development of Greece that was slowly recovering from the two      wars, the Second World War and the Civil War. More and more      Greeks could afford to buy radios and record players. The Greek      record companies, seeing the potential of Laika, signed      contracts with singers, musicians and composers and the mass      production of popular Greek music really began to take off.             Throughout the 1960s saw the growth of the well-known tavernas      that offered live music shows, the Bouzoukia. This occurred      particularly in areas of Athens. One of the most fashionable      area at the time was Tzitzifies. The 1960s saw the absolute      domination of Laika. Great performers became known to all Greek      households. Names such as Grigoris Bithikotsis, Stelios      Kazantzidis, Stamatis Kokotas, Manolis Angelopoulos, Marinela,      Giota Lidia, Doukisa, Poly Panou, Panos Cavalas with Ria Kourti,      Viky Mosholiou were all singing the songs of famous composers      like Vasilis Tsitsanis, Giannis Papaioannou, Markos Vamvakaris,      Giorgos Zambetas, Giorgos Mitsakis, Apostolos Kardaras and many      others.            There is a big dispute about what is considered as Greek popular      music during those days because, as is well known in the modern      Greek music world, many composers of those years were tuning      their radios every night to the short wave frequencies and      listening to the music from several Arabian countries as well as      India. The music they then went on to compose was highly      influenced (and in some cases even copied) from songs of these      countries. I can recall personally that, back in the 1980s, I      was playing in a Greek folk band where we had amongst our      members a bouzouki player who was Iranian. He taught us a famous      Persian folk song (Masta) which, some years later became a top      hit in Greece but played by a completely different Greek band.      Many they say that authentic Greek folk music was developed      firstly by Marcos Vamvakaris, with his famous song Fragosyriani      . With this song Vamvakaris introduces new musical roots with      more Western sounds that blend perfectly with the old sounds of      Rebetiko. The same happens also with Vasillis Tsitsanis and his      song Omorfi Thessaloniki. Both these songs are the typical      Hasapiko dance songs. Finally, there is George Zambetas with the      song Syko Horepse       Syrtaki which seals a whole era that follows with the name      'Greek tourist music'. At this point it is interesting to      mention that during the 1960s The Beatles were said to have      visited Greece and met with Zambetas to learn some of the      techniques of Greek music and bouzouki. It is not strange      therefore that, to the Greek ear, the Beatles' song 'Girl' is a      typical Greek Hasapiko.                                                                    In the middle of the 1960s a new kind of music began to be heard      in Greece. this was the Greek New Wave music which was inspired      by Western ballads and styles that were first introduced in      Paris in the Boifes music halls. the New Wave became the      favourite music style of the young Greek intellectuals and      sophisticates. The Buite Esperides of Yiannis Argyris and      Apanemia of George Zografos, both in Plaka in Athens, became the      shrines of this New Wave. It was the time of great performers      like Dionyssis Sourpopoulos to make a huge turnaround in the      Greek music scene developing it towards Western ballads, Blues      and Rock. During this time new performers of the Greek new wave      like Giannis Poulopoulos, Kostas Hadjis, Arleta and others make      a significant presence.            Of course, the composers that made the Greek music known      internationally are Mikis Theodorakis with his famous Zorba the      Greek Manos Hadzidakis with Never on Sunday , and Stavros      Xarhakos with his music in the film The Red Lights. These three      composers are acknowledge as the greatest composers of modern      Greece and you will often hear their names mentioned in musical      circles as 'the fat' (Hiadjidakis) 'the tall' (Theodorakis) and      'the short' (Xarhakos). Of course, we should not forget another      great composer, Vangelis Papathanasiou, who left Greece with      Demis Roussos in the late 1960s to set up the famous group,      Aphrodite's Child, in Paris France which was the beginning of      their international careers.            From the 1970s and 1980s onwards, the Greek music became more      and more distant from the original sounds of the 1950s and 60s.      This decade saw the introduction of new sounds, digital      recordings with sound effects and the absolute domination of the      synthesiser keyboard pushing away the original folk instruments      of 25 years before and, in particular, delegating the bouzouki      sound to a backing role.

Last Supper, 1495-98. Tempera and mixed media on plaster. 460 x 880 cm (15.09 x 28.87 ft.). Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan             Why did Leonardo paint this?     Because his employer requested he do so. Leonardo worked for Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, for nearly eighteen years (1482-99). The Duke decided he wanted this particular religious scene painted and Leonardo, who was  not  stupid, decided painting it made perfect financial sense.    How big is it?    It's huge, really - 460 x 880 cm (15 x 29 feet). It covers an entire large wall, very unlike reproductions sized to hang neatly behind one's sofa.    Where is it?    The original mural is on a wall of the refectory (dining hall) in the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy.    If you'd care to see a reproduction or fifty, they're easily found. As an image,  Last Supper  has been put on everything from mirrors, to mouse pads, to musical pillows. If Leonardo were still around, he'd be earning billions of (insert your currency here) on licensing fees alone.    How long did it take Leonardo to paint this?    He began working on it in 1495, and finished  Last Supper  in 1498. This is worth noting, as Leonardo was a known procrastinator with a marked tendency to leave projects unfinished.     Why is the composition remarkable?    First, because the disciples are all displaying very human, identifiable emotions. ""The Last Supper"" had certainly been painted before. Leonardo's version, though, was the first to depict real people  acting like  real people.    Secondly, and of major importance - the technical perspective in  Last Supper  is incredible! You can see that every single element of the painting directs one's attention straight to the midpoint of the composition, Christ's head. It's arguably the greatest example of one point perspective ever created.    What does  Last Supper  depict?    Last Supper  is Leonardo's visual interpretation of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels (books in the Christian New Testament). The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord). As they ate and drank together, Christ gave the disciples explicit instructions on how to eat and drink in the future, in remembrance of him. It was the first celebration of the  Eucharist , a ritual still performed.    Specifically,  Last Supper  depicts the next few seconds in this story  after  Christ dropped the bombshell that one disciple would betray him before sunrise, and all twelve have reacted to the news with different degrees of horror, anger and shock.    Who's in it?    Looking across the picture from left to right:      Bartholomew, James Minor  and  Andrew  form a group of three. All are aghast, Andrew to the point of holding his hands up in a ""stop!"" gesture.       Judas, Peter  and  John  form the next group of three. Judas, you will note, has his face in shadow and is clutching a small bag (of silver?). Peter is visibly angry and a  feminine-looking John  seems about to swoon.      Christ  is the calm in the midst of the storm.      Thomas, James Major  and  Philip  are next. Thomas is clearly agitated, James Major stunned and Philip seems to be seeking clarification.      Matthew, Thaddeus  and  Simon  comprise the last group of three figures. It appears that, when a situation turns ugly, Simon is the ""go to"" guy for explanations.    Why is it falling apart?    Leonardo, always the inventor, tried using new materials for  Last Supper . Instead of using tempera on wet plaster (the preferred method of fresco painting, and one which had worked successfully for centuries), he thought he'd give using  dry  plaster a whirl. His experiment resulted in a more varied palette, which was Leonardo's intent. What he hadn't taken into account (because, who knew?) was that this method wasn't at all durable. The painted plaster began to flake off the wall almost immediately, and people have been attempting to restore it ever since.    Why doesn't Jesus have any feet?    Rest assured, Leonardo intended for Christ to have feet and, in fact, painted them. Around 1650, some unnamed, woefully misguided soul - on a mission to insert another door into the refectory - apparently decided that the  only  logical spot for said door was smack dab in the middle of that wall. We probably shouldn't grumble and just consider ourselves lucky that he wasn't engineering windows.    I heard this story about  Last Supper . Is it true?    Do you mean the story in which Leonardo first paints Jesus Christ, after searching many months for the perfect model? And then, years and years later, after painting all eleven other disciples, has an even more grueling search for the perfect model for Judas? And - amazingly - the  same person  ends up being the model for both? That story?    No, it's not true, and for so many reasons (all of which are detailed in a piece at  Snopes ). It's a neat bit of fiction, though, complete with a moral.    Related FAQ Gallery :  A Guide to Leonardo and Art in The Da Vinci Code .

The Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie was fully involved and in 1495, when Donato Montorfano was completing his Crucifixion for the Refectory, Leonardo was commissioned by the Duke to decorate the facing wall with a Last Supper. The commission is documented by the coats of arms that appear within plant garlands in the four lunettes above the ""Supper"" and are a reminder of the names of Ludovico, Beatrice and their children.    The Last Supper was quite slow in evolving despite the urgings of Ludovico Sforza and the prior. It actually took Leonardo about four years (1494-1498) with the dry or tempera technique he had decided to use, as if it had been a great tablet (4.60x8.80m). First of all he decided not to apply the consolidated fresco technique, which offered assurances for conservation, but was time-consuming to spread. What Leonardo required was the utmost freedom during the executive stage in order to correct, modify and achieve special color effects. Moreover, the fresco technique was irreconcilable with his bizarre temperament that led him to alternate periods of intense activity with others of total rest, as related by Matteo Bandello, who was a guest of the convent fathers and often saw Leonardo at work.    Although The Last Supper was a traditional theme used to decorate convent refectories, especially in Florence (memorable are those by Taddeo Gaddi, Beato Angelico, Andrea del Castagno and Ghirlandaio), Leonardo presented the subject in a completely innovative form. Not only did he make drastic modifications to the layout of the scene, but also the true novelty was the astounding realism with which he recounted this episode from the Gospels.
