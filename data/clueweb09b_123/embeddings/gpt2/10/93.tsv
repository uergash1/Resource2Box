When the laws changed so that, for those of African ancestry, servitude followed the condition of the mother, not the father, the system of chattel slavery had begun.  The story of African American women in these times is mostly of women without names.  Phillis Wheatley is one, but not the only, exception to this enforced anonymity.

Women were quite active in the abolitionist movement. White women came out of their domestic sphere to work against the enslavement of others.

clueweb09-enwp01-65-12111	"                     Madam C. J. Walker          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Madame C. J. Walker )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                       Madam Walker in a photograph ca. 1914 by  Addison Scurlock .       Madam C.J. Walker  ( December 23 ,  1867    May 25 ,  1919 ) was an  American   businesswoman ,  hair care   entrepreneur ,  tycoon  and  philanthropist . She died after World War I.   Her fortune was made by developing and marketing a hugely successful line of beauty and hair products for black women, under the company she founded Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company. The  Guinness Book of Records  cites Walker as the first female, black or white, who became a  millionaire  by her own achievements.   In  2002 , scholar  Molefi Kete Asante  listed Madam C. J. Walker on his list of  100 Greatest African Americans . [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Biography   2   See also   3   References   4   Further reading   5   External links               Biography   She was born Sarah Breedlove in  Delta, Louisiana , the first member of her family to be born free. Her parents had been slaves. At age 14, she married a man named Moses McWilliams and was widowed at age 20. She then moved to  St. Louis, Missouri  to join her brothers. Sarah worked as a laundress for as little as a dollar and a half a day, but she was able to save enough to educate her daughter. While living in St. Louis, she joined  St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church , which helped develop her speaking, interpersonal and organizational skills. She was married in 1894 to John Davis and divorced about nine years later.   When she began to lose her hair, she had the idea for a line of hair care products. Like that of most other Americans in the early 1900s, Walker's home lacked indoor plumbing, electricity and central heating. Like many women of that era, she washed her hair only once a month. As a result, she suffered from severe  dandruff  and scalp disease that nearly caused her to go bald.   In 1905, Davis moved to  Denver, Colorado , where she worked as a sales agent for Annie Malone, another black woman entrepreneur who manufactured hair care products. Sarah also consulted with a Denver pharmacist, who analyzed Malone's formula and helped Walker formulate her own products. In addition, she often told reporters that the ingredients for her ""Wonderful Hair Grower"" had come to her in a dream.   In 1906 she married Charles Joseph Walker, a St. Louis newspaperman, and changed her name to ""Madam C.J. Walker"". She founded the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company to sell hair care products and  cosmetics . Madam Walker divorced Walker in 1910 and moved her growing manufacturing operations from St. Louis to a new industrial complex in  Indianapolis . By 1917 she had the largest business in the  United States  owned by a black person.          I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations...I have built my own factory on my own ground. [ 2 ]                 There is no royal, flower-strewn path to success. And if there is, I have not found it for if I have accomplished anything in life, it is because I have been willing to work hard. [ 2 ]          Walker saw her personal wealth not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote economic opportunities for others, especially black people. She took great pride in the profitable employment  and alternative to domestic labor  that her company afforded many thousands of black women who worked as commissioned agents. Her agents could earn from $5 to $15 per day in an era when unskilled white laborers were making about $11 per week. [ 3 ]   Marjorie Joyner , who started work as one of her employees, went on to lead the next generation of African-American beauty entrepreneurs.   Walker was known for her philanthropy, leaving two-thirds of her estate to educational institutions and charities, including the  NAACP , the  Tuskegee Institute  and  Bethune-Cookman College . In 1919, her $5,000 pledge to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign was the largest gift the organization had ever received.   Walker had a mansion called "" Villa Lewaro "" built in the wealthy New York suburb of  Irvington on Hudson, New York , near the estates of  John D. Rockefeller  and  Jay Gould . She spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furnishings. [ 4 ]  The  Italianate   villa  was designed by architect  Vertner Tandy , the first registered black  architect  in the state of New York, in 1915. Walker also owned townhouses in  Indianapolis  and New York.   Madam Walker died on May 25, 1919, at age 51, at her estate  Villa Lewaro . She passed away because of kidney failure and other complications resulting from  hypertension . She was buried at  Woodlawn Cemetery  in  the Bronx .   Her daughter  A'Lelia Walker  carried on the tradition of hospitality, opening her mother's home and her own to writers and artists of the emergent  Harlem Renaissance . She promoted important members of that movement. [ 5 ]  She converted a section of her  Harlem  townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street into the Dark Tower, a salon and tearoom where Harlem and  Greenwich Village  artists, writers and musicians gathered. Poet  Langston Hughes  called her ""The joy goddess of Harlem's 1920s"" in his autobiography  The Big Sea , because of the lavish parties she hosted in Harlem and  Irvington .

Dates:   December 23, 1867 – May 25, 1919    Occupation:   inventor, entrepreneur, philanthropist, social activist   In the early 1900s, Madam C.J. Walker was one of the most well known blacks of the time. America’s first black woman millionaire made her fortune with the invention of hair care products specifically tailored to black women.  She had a hand in revolutionizing the way black women styled their hair by combining the use of the hot comb with her hair care products.      Walker’s Early Life   On December 23, 1867, Madam C.J. Walker was born with the name Sarah Breedlove, near Delta, Louisiana on a cotton plantation.  Her parents died when she was seven years old, and Walker and her sister survived by working in the cotton fields in Vicksburg, Mississippi.  When she was fourteen, she married laborer, Moses McWilliams.  Their marriage lasted for six years, until he died in an accident.  A widow at twenty and the mother of a young daughter, Breedlove moved to St. Louis, Missouri to work as a laundress.      Walker Creates Hair Care Products   Walker began to suffer from hair loss, so she started working as a sales agent for Annie Turnbo Pope Malone’s Poro Company selling hair grower.  Realizing the great potential in beauty products for black women, Walker moved to Denver to start her own hair care business.  Walker married Charles Joseph Walker, a newspaper sales agent who later helped her advertise her products in black newspapers.   Walker invented several hair care products.  Among the product were Madam Walker's Wonderful Hair Grower and a hair softener that could be used with hot combs.  Walker traveled throughout the United States speaking about her hair care products, giving demonstrations and selling them door-to-door.  As her products became popular, she also became one of the most well known black Americans of the time.      In 1908, she opened Lelia College in Pittsburgh, which was used to train “beauty culturists.”  At Walker’s high point, she employed over three thousand workers, most of whom were door-to-door saleswomen.  For the time, they were paid well, making five to fifteen dollars per day.  In 1910, she moved her headquarters to Indianapolis.      Walker Supports Charitable and Political Causes   In addition to her business sense, she was charitable with her wealth and became involved in social and political activities.  In Indianapolis she provided the funding for the construction of a black YMCA, donated money to the  NAACP , funded the preservation of the home of  Frederick Douglass , funded scholarships for  Booker T. Washington’s  Tuskegee Institute, and donated to several other charitable institutions.     Walker also became involved in social and political activities.  In 1917, she participated in an anti-lynching protest in East St. Louis, Illinois, where three dozen blacks had been murdered by a white mob.     In 1918, her home, Villa Lewaro, in Irvington-on-Hudson, New York, designed by black architect Vertner Tandy, was completed.  One year later, Walker died of kidney disease.

She was active in preserving the memory of her husband and in political issues. She fought to make her husband's birthday, a national holiday, a dream that was realized in 1986. She was  present when President Ronald Reagan signed the legislation establishing Martin Luther King Day.      President George W.

She had a perfect life and enough sense to live it to the hilt, but then a war she didn fully understand turned everything upside down, thrusting her into a role she never wanted and was not prepared to play. Suddenly the target of angry protests aimed at the country she had never really felt was her own, Josephine is forced to return to America to see if she can create a new definition of home.

To help  celebrate this special occasion, the City of New York is sponsoring the 6th annual Poem In  Your Pocket Day on April 17, 2008. This collaboration between the NYC  Department of Education, the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Mayor’s  Office, celebrates poetry by highlighting poetry events all month. New Yorkers  are encouraged to carry a poem in their pockets and share with family, friends,  coworkers and classmates. Public schools, after-school programs, and cultural  institutions throughout the five boroughs will highlight poetry on this day  through readings by poets, poetry workshops and specifically designed lesson  plans.                                              This year, the  Poetry Society of America  and the  New  York Public Library  are working to bring John Waldman’s writing project to New York City.  Mr.  Waldman takes published poems and places them inside envelopes.  He then  writes the first line of the poem on the outside of the envelope and  distributes the envelopes, so that participants may use the first line as a  jumping off point to write their own poem.  At the end of the project, the  participants share their poems with each other, along with the published poems.                        If you are interested in participating, click  here  (in  PDF ) to  download 17 first lines from poems that are in the public domain and may be  reproduced freely.  The full poems may be downloaded  here  (in  PDF ).  To  learn more about how this extraordinary project works, click  here  (in  PDF ). And the  New York Public Library is hosting a site ( www.nypl.org/blog ) for participants to  post poems that have been written as part of this project, beginning on  Wednesday, April 16.                      Tuck a poem in your pocket and share the joys of poetry with those around you.  What will your poem be?    Be sure to look at the Events Calendar listings to find out about events for  adults, children and families celebrating the power of poems.

While living in St. Louis, she joined  St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church , which helped develop her speaking, interpersonal and organizational skills. She was married in 1894 to John Davis and divorced about nine years later.   When she began to lose her hair, she had the idea for a line of hair care products. Like that of most other Americans in the early 1900s, Walker's home lacked indoor plumbing, electricity and central heating. Like many women of that era, she washed her hair only once a month. As a result, she suffered from severe  dandruff  and scalp disease that nearly caused her to go bald.   In 1905, Davis moved to  Denver, Colorado , where she worked as a sales agent for Annie Malone, another black woman entrepreneur who manufactured hair care products. Sarah also consulted with a Denver pharmacist, who analyzed Malone's formula and helped Walker formulate her own products. In addition, she often told reporters that the ingredients for her ""Wonderful Hair Grower"" had come to her in a dream.   In 1906 she married Charles Joseph Walker, a St. Louis newspaperman, and changed her name to ""Madam C.J. Walker"". She founded the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company to sell hair care products and  cosmetics . Madam Walker divorced Walker in 1910 and moved her growing manufacturing operations from St. Louis to a new industrial complex in  Indianapolis . By 1917 she had the largest business in the  United States  owned by a black person.          I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations...I have built my own factory on my own ground. [ 2 ]                 There is no royal, flower-strewn path to success. And if there is, I have not found it for if I have accomplished anything in life, it is because I have been willing to work hard. [ 2 ]          Walker saw her personal wealth not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote economic opportunities for others, especially black people. She took great pride in the profitable employment  and alternative to domestic labor  that her company afforded many thousands of black women who worked as commissioned agents. Her agents could earn from $5 to $15 per day in an era when unskilled white laborers were making about $11 per week. [ 3 ]   Marjorie Joyner , who started work as one of her employees, went on to lead the next generation of African-American beauty entrepreneurs.   Walker was known for her philanthropy, leaving two-thirds of her estate to educational institutions and charities, including the  NAACP , the  Tuskegee Institute  and  Bethune-Cookman College . In 1919, her $5,000 pledge to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign was the largest gift the organization had ever received.   Walker had a mansion called "" Villa Lewaro "" built in the wealthy New York suburb of  Irvington on Hudson, New York , near the estates of  John D. Rockefeller  and  Jay Gould . She spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furnishings. [ 4 ]  The  Italianate   villa  was designed by architect  Vertner Tandy , the first registered black  architect  in the state of New York, in 1915. Walker also owned townhouses in  Indianapolis  and New York.   Madam Walker died on May 25, 1919, at age 51, at her estate  Villa Lewaro . She passed away because of kidney failure and other complications resulting from  hypertension . She was buried at  Woodlawn Cemetery  in  the Bronx .   Her daughter  A'Lelia Walker  carried on the tradition of hospitality, opening her mother's home and her own to writers and artists of the emergent  Harlem Renaissance . She promoted important members of that movement. [ 5 ]  She converted a section of her  Harlem  townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street into the Dark Tower, a salon and tearoom where Harlem and  Greenwich Village  artists, writers and musicians gathered. Poet  Langston Hughes  called her ""The joy goddess of Harlem's 1920s"" in his autobiography  The Big Sea , because of the lavish parties she hosted in Harlem and  Irvington .
