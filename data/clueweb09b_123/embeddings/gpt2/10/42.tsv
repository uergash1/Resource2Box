In some of the editions of his works he is called Megarensis, as if he had been born at  Megara  in  Greece , a mistake which arose from confounding him with  Euclid of Megara , a disciple of Socrates.   Proclus Diadochus  (AD 412-485), the authority for most of our information regarding Euclid, states in his commentary on the first book of the  Elements  that Euclid lived in the time of  Ptolemy I , king of  Egypt , who reigned from 323-285 BC, that he was younger than the associates of  Plato , but older than  Eratosthenes  (276-196 BC) and  Archimedes  (287-212 BC).  Euclid is said to have founded the mathematical school of  Alexandria , which was at the time becoming a center not only of commerce, but also of learning and research, and for this service to the cause of exact science he would have deserved commemoration, even if his writings had not secured him a worthier title to fame.   Proclus  preserves a reply made by Euclid to King Ptolemy, who asked whether he could not learn geometry more easily than by studying the Elements - ""There is no royal road to geometry.""   Pappus of Alexandria , in his  Mathematical Collection , says that  Euclid  was a man of mild and inoffensive temperament, unpretending, and kind to all genuine students of mathematics.  This being all that is known of the life and character of  Euclid , it only remains therefore to speak of his works.    Among those which have come down to us the most remarkable is the  Elements  ( Stoicheia ).  They consist of thirteen books; two more are frequently added, but there is reason to believe that they are the work of a later mathematician,  Hypsciles of Alexandria .   The question has often been mooted, to what extent  Euclid , in his  Elements , is a discoverer or a compiler.  To this question no entirely satisfactory answer can be given, for scarcely any of the writings of the earlier geometers have come down to our times.  We are mainly dependent on  Pappus  and  Proclus  for the scanty notices we have of Euclid's predecessors, and of the problems which engaged their attention; for the solution of problems, and not the discovery of theorems, would seem to have been their principal object.  From these authors we learn that the property of the right angled triangle has been found out, the principles of geometrical analysis laid down, the restriction of constructions in  plane geometry  to the straight line and the circle agreed upon, the doctrine of proportion, for both  commensurable s and  incommensurable s, as well as loci, plane and solid, and some of the properties of the conic sections investigated, the five regular solids (often called the  Platonic bodies ) and the relation between the volume of a cone or pyramid and that of its circumscribed cylinder or prism discovered.  Elementary works had been written, and the famous problem of the duplication of the cube reduced to the determination of two mean proportionals between two given straight lines.  Notwithstanding this amount of discovery, and all that it implied, Euclid must have made a great advance beyond his predecessors (we are told that ""he arranged the discoveries of  Eudoxus , perfected those of  Theaetetus , and reduced to invincible demonstration many things which had previously been more loosely proved""), for his  Elements  supplanted all similar treatises, and, as Apollonius received the title of ""the great geometer,"" so Euclid has come down to latter ages as ""the elementator.""   For the past twenty centuries parts of the  Elements , notably the  first six books , have been used as an introduction to  geometry .  Though they are now to some extent superseded in most countries, their long retention is a proof that they were, at any rate, no unsuitable for such a purpose.  They are, speaking generally, not too difficult for novices in the science; the demonstrations are rigorous, ingenious and often elegant the mixture of problems and theorems gives perhaps some variety, and makes their study less monotonous; and, if regard be had merely to the metrical properties of space as distinguished from the graphical, hardly any cardinal geometrical truths are omitted.  With these excellence are combined a good many defects, some of them inevitable to a system based on a very few axioms and postulates.  Thus the arrangement of the propositions seems arbitrary; associated theorems and problems are not grouped together; the classification, in short, is imperfect.  Other objections, not to mention minor blemishes, are the  prolixinty  of the style, arising partly from a defective nomenclature, the treatment of parallels depending on an axiom which is not axiomatic, and the sparing use of superposition as a method of proof.     Of the 33 ancient books subservient to geometrical analysis, Pappus enumerates first the  Data  ( Dedomena ), of Euclid.  He says it contained 90  proposition s, the scope of which he describes; it now contains 95.  It is not easy to explain this discrepancy, unless we suppose that some of the propositions, as they existed in the time of Pappus, have since been split into two, or that what were once  scholia  have since been erected into propositions.  The object of the  Data  is to show that when certain things - lines, angles, spaces, ratios, etc - are given by hypothesis, certain other things are given, that is, determinable.  The book, as we are expressly told, and as we may gather from its contents, was intended for the investigation of problems; and it has been conjectured that Euclid must have extended the method of the  Data  to the investigation of theorems.  What prompts this conjecture is the similarity between the analysis of a theorem and the method, common enough in the Elements, of  reductio ad absurdum  - the one setting out from the supposition that the theorem is true, the other from the supposition that it is false, thence in both cases deducing a chain of consequences that end in a conclusion previously known to be true or false.   The  Introduction to Harmony  ( Eisagoge armonike ), and the  Section of the Scale  ( Katatome kanonos ), treat of music.  There is good reason for believing that one at any rate, and probably both of these books are not by Euclid.  No mention is made of them by any writer prior to  Ptolemy  (AD 140), or by Ptolemy himself, and in no ancient codex are they ascribed to Euclid.   The  Phaenomena  ( Phainomena ) contains an exposition of the appearances produced by the motion attributed to the celestial sphere.  Pappus, in a few remarks prefatory to his sixth book complains of the faults, both of omission and commission, of writers of astronomy, and cites as an example of the former the second theorem of Euclid's Phaenomena, whence, and from the interpolation of other proofs,  David Gregory  infers that this treatise is corrupt.     The  Optics  and  Catoptrics  ( Optika, Katoptrika ) are ascribed to Euclid by Proclus, and by  Marinus  in his preface to the Data, but no mention is made of them by Pappus.  This latter circumstance, taken in connection with the fact that two of the propositions in the sixth book of the Mathematical Collection prove the same things as three in the Optics, is one of the reasons given by Gregory for deeming the work spurious.  Several other reasons will be found in Gregory's preface to his edition of Euclid's works.   In some editions of Euclid's works there is given a book on the  Divisions of Superfices , which consists of a few propositions, showing how a straight line may be drawn to divide in a given ratio triangles, quadrilaterals and pentagons.  This was supposed by  John Dee  of  London , who transcribed or translated it, and entrusted it for publication to his friend  Federico Commandino  of  Urbino , to be the treatise of Euclid referred to by Proclus as to  peri diaireseon biblion .  Dee mentions that, in the copy from which he wrote, the book was ascribed to  Machomet of Baghdad , and adduces two or three reasons for thinking it to be Euclid's.  This opinion, however, he does not seem to have held very strongly, nor does it appear that it was adopted by Commandino.  The book does not exist in Greek.   The fragment, in Latin,  De levi et ponderoso , which is of no value, and was printed at the end of Gregory's edition only in order that nothing might be left out, is mentioned neither by Pappus nor Proclus, and occurs first in  Bartholomew Zamberti 's edition of 1537.  There is no reason for supposing it to be genuine.   The following works attributed to Euclid are not now extant -  1. Three books on  Porisms  ( Peri ton porismaton ) are mentioned both by Pappus and Proclus, and the former gives an abstract of them, with the lemmas assumed.  2. Two books are mentioned, named  Topon pros epithaneia , which is rendered  Locorum ad superficiem  by Commandino and subsequent geomters.  These books were subservient to the analysis of  loci , but the four lemmas which refer to them and which occur at the end of the seventh book of the  Mathematical Collection , throw very little light on their contents.   R. Simson 's opinion was that they treated of curves of double curvature, and he intended at one time to write a treatise on the subject.  3. Pappus says that Euclid wrote four books on the  Conic Sections  ( biblia tessara Konikon ), which  Apollonius of Perga  amplified, and to which he added four more.  It is known that, in the time of Euclid, the parabola was considered as the section of a right angled cone, the ellipse that of an acute acute angled cone, the hyperbola that of an obtuse angled cone, and that Appolonius was the first to show that the three sections could be obtained from any cone.  There is good ground therefore for supposing that the first four books of Apollonius's  Conics , which are still extant, resemble Euclid's Conics even less than Euclid's Elements do those of Eudoxus and Theaetetus.  4. A book on  Fallacies  ( Peri pheudarion ) is mentioned by Proclus, who says Euclid wrote it for the purpose of exercising beginners in the detection of errors in reasoning.

clueweb09-enwp00-73-11127	"                     Euclid's Elements          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 The  frontispiece  of Sir Henry Billingsley's first English version of Euclid's  Elements , 1570       Euclid's  Elements  ( Greek :   ) is a  mathematical  and  geometric   treatise  consisting of 13 books written by the  Greek mathematician   Euclid  in  Alexandria   circa  300 BC. It comprises a collection of definitions, postulates ( axioms ), propositions ( theorems  and  constructions ), and  mathematical proofs  of the propositions. The thirteen books cover  Euclidean geometry  and the ancient Greek version of elementary  number theory . With the exception of  Autolycus'   On the Moving Sphere , the  Elements  is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatises [ 1 ]  and it is the oldest extant axiomatic deductive treatment of  mathematics . [ 2 ]  It has proven instrumental in the development of  logic  and modern  science .   Euclid's  Elements  is the most successful [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  and influential [ 5 ]  textbook ever written. Being first set in type in  Venice  in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the  printing press  and is estimated to be second only to the  Bible  in the number of editions published, [ 5 ]  with the number reaching well over one thousand. [ 6 ]  It was used as the basic text on geometry throughout the Western world for about 2,000 years. For centuries, when the  quadrivium  was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid's  Elements  was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through school books, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read. [ 2 ]           Contents       1   History     1.1   A difficult text       2   Outline of Elements     2.1   First principles   2.2   Parallel postulate   2.3   Contents of the books       3   Missing axioms   4   Apocrypha   5   Editions     5.1   Translations   5.2   Currently in print       6   Notes   7   References   8   External links               [ edit ]   History          The frontispiece of an  Adelard of Bath  Latin translation of Euclid's  Elements , c. 13091316; the oldest surviving Latin translation of the  Elements  is a 12th century work by Adelard, which translates to Latin from the Arabic. [ 7 ]       Euclid  was a  Greek  mathematician who wrote  Elements  in Alexandria during the  Hellenistic period  (around 300 BC). Scholars believe that the  Elements  is largely a collection of theorems proved by other mathematicians supplemented by some original work.  Proclus , a Greek mathematician who lived several centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary of the  Elements : ""Euclid, who put together the Elements, collecting many of  Eudoxus ' theorems, perfecting many of  Theaetetus ', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors"".   Although known to, for instance,  Cicero , there is no extant record of the text having been translated into Latin prior to  Boethius  in the fifth or sixth century. [ 7 ]  The Arabs received the  Elements  from the Byzantines in approximately 760; this version, by a pupil of Euclid called  Proclo , was translated into  Arabic  under  Harun al Rashid  circa 800 AD. [ 7 ]  The first printed edition appeared in 1482 (based on  Giovanni Campano's  1260 edition), and since then it has been translated into many languages and published in about a thousand different editions. In 1570,  John Dee  provided a widely respected ""Mathematical Preface"", along with copious notes and supplementary material, to the first English edition by  Henry Billingsley .   Copies of the Greek text still exist, some of which can be found in the  Vatican Library  and the  Bodleian Library  in Oxford. The manuscripts available are of variable quality, and invariably incomplete. By careful analysis of the translations and originals, hypotheses have been drawn about the contents of the original text (copies of which are no longer available).   Ancient texts which refer to the  Elements  itself and to other mathematical theories that were current at the time it was written are also important in this process. Such analyses are conducted by  J. L. Heiberg  and Sir  Thomas Little Heath  in their editions of the text.   Also of importance are the  scholia , or annotations to the text. These additions, which often distinguished themselves from the main text (depending on the manuscript), gradually accumulated over time as opinions varied upon what was worthy of explanation or elucidation.     [ edit ]   A difficult text   Although we now consider the  Elements  to be an elementary text on geometry, that was not always the case. It is said that King  Ptolemy  asked for a way in geometry that was shorter than the Elements. Euclid answered that ""there is no  royal road  to geometry.""  [ 8 ]  More recently, Sir  Thomas Little Heath  wrote, in his introduction to the 1932 Everyman's Library volume of  Euclid :     The simple truth is that it was not written for schoolboys or schoolgirls, but for the grown man who would have the necessary knowledge and judgment to appreciate the highly contentious matters which have to be grappled with in any attempt to set out the essentials of Euclidean geometry as a strictly  logical system ..."". [ 9 ]     The first difficult passage of Book I is referred to as the  pons asinorum , which is Latin for ""Bridge of Asses"" (traditionally, it is hard to get  asses  to cross a bridge). [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Outline of  Elements          A proof from Euclid's  Elements  that, given a line segment, an equilateral triangle exists that includes the segment as one of its sides. The proof is by construction: an equilateral triangle  is made by drawing circles  and  centered on the points  and , and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.       The  Elements  is still considered a masterpiece in the application of  logic  to  mathematics . In historical context, it has proven enormously influential in many areas of  science . Scientists  Nicolaus Copernicus ,  Johannes Kepler ,  Galileo Galilei , and Sir  Isaac Newton  were all influenced by the  Elements , and applied their knowledge of it to their work. Mathematicians and philosophers, such as  Bertrand Russell ,  Alfred North Whitehead , and  Baruch Spinoza , have attempted to create their own foundational ""Elements"" for their respective disciplines, by adopting the axiomatized deductive structures that Euclid's work introduced.   The success of the  Elements  is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are his. However, Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the  Elements , encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The  Elements  still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.   Although  Elements  is primarily a geometric work, it also includes results that today would be classified as  number theory . A construction used in any of Euclid's proofs required a proof that it is actually possible. This avoids the problems the Pythagoreans encountered with irrationals, since their fallacious proofs usually required a statement such as ""Find the greatest common measure of ..."" [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   First principles   Euclid's Book 1 begins with 23 definitions  such as  point ,  line , and  surface   followed by five  postulates  and five ""common notions"" (both of which are today called  axioms ). These are the foundation of all that follows.   Postulates:     A straight line segment can be drawn by joining any two points.   A straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.   Given a straight line segment, a circle can be drawn using the segment as radius and one endpoint as center.   All right angles are equal.   If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.     Common notions:     Things which equal the same thing are equal to one another. ( Euclidean property  of  equality )   If equals are added to equals, then the sums are equal. (Addition property of equality)   If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal. (Subtraction property of equality)   Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another. ( Reflexive property  of equality)   The whole is greater than the part.     These basic principles reflect the interest of Euclid, along with his contemporary Greek and Hellenistic mathematicians, in constructive geometry. The first three postulates basically describe the  constructions  one can carry out with a  compass  and an unmarked  straightedge . A marked  ruler , used in  neusis construction , is forbidden in Euclid construction.     [ edit ]   Parallel postulate       Main article:  Parallel postulate              If the sum of the two interior angles equals 180, the lines are parallel and will never intersect.       The last of Euclid's five postulates warrants special mention. Euclid's fifth postulate implies that when parallel lines are crossed by a transversal then same side interior angles are supplementary. In Euclid's system the converse is also true (see figure). Together these statements may be given in a logically equivalent form known as  Playfair's axiom , named after the Scottish  mathematician   John Playfair . It states:     Exactly one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line  parallel  to the given line in a plane. [ 12 ]     The so-called  parallel postulate  always seemed less obvious than the others. Euclid himself used it only sparingly throughout the rest of the  Elements . Many geometers suspected that it might be provable from the other postulates, but all attempts to do this failed.   By the mid-19th century, it was shown that no such proof exists, because one can construct  non-Euclidean geometries  where the parallel postulate is false, while the other postulates remain true. For this reason, mathematicians say that the parallel postulate is  independent  of the other postulates.   Two alternatives to the parallel postulate are possible in non-Euclidean geometries: in a  hyperbolic geometry  (also called  Lobachevskian  geometry ) an infinite number of parallel lines can be drawn through a point not on a given line, whereas in an  elliptic geometry  (also called  Riemannian geometry ) no parallel lines exist. That other geometries could be logically consistent was one of the most important discoveries in mathematics, with vast implications for science and philosophy. Indeed,  Albert Einstein 's theory of  general relativity  hypothesizes that the real space in which we live is non-Euclidean.     [ edit ]   Contents of the books          A fragment of Euclid's elements found at  Oxyrhynchus , which is dated to circa 100 AD. The diagram accompanies Proposition 5 of Book II of the  Elements .       Books 1 through 4 deal with plane geometry:     Book 1 contains Euclid's 5 axioms (including the  parallel postulate ) and the basic propositions of geometry: the  pons asinorum  (proposition 5) , the  Pythagorean theorem  (Proposition 47), equality of angles and  areas , parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the three cases in which triangles are ""equal"" (have the same area).   Book 2 is commonly called the ""book of geometrical algebra,"" because the material it contains may easily be interpreted in terms of  algebra .   Book 3 deals with circles and their properties:  inscribed  angles,  tangents , the power of a point.   Book 4 constructs the  incircle  and  circumcircle  of a triangle, and constructs  regular polygons  with 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides.     Books 5 through 10 introduce  ratios  and  proportions :     Book 5 is a treatise on proportions of  magnitudes . Proposition 25 has as a special case the  inequality of arithmetic and geometric means .   Book 6 applies proportions to geometry:  Thales' theorem , similar figures.   Book 7 deals strictly with elementary number theory:  divisibility ,  prime numbers ,  Euclid's algorithm  for finding the  greatest common divisor ,  least common multiple . Propositions 30 and 32 together are essentially equivalent to the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic  stating that every positive integer can be written as a product of primes in an essentially unique way, though Euclid would have had trouble stating it in this modern form as he did not use the product of more than 3 numbers.   Book 8 deals with proportions in number theory and  geometric sequences .   Book 9 applies the results of the preceding two books and gives the infinitude of prime numbers (proposition 20), the sum of a  geometric series  (proposition 35), and the construction of even  perfect numbers  (proposition 36).   Book 10 attempts to classify  incommensurable  (in modern language,  irrational ) magnitudes by using the  method of exhaustion , a precursor to  integration .     Books 11 through 13 deal with spatial geometry:     Book 11 generalizes the results of Books 16 to space: perpendicularity, parallelism, volumes of  parallelepipeds .   Book 12 calculates areas and volumes by using the method of exhaustion:  cones ,  pyramids ,  cylinders , and the  sphere .   Book 13 constructs the five regular  Platonic solids  inscribed in a sphere, calculates the ratio of their edges to the radius of the sphere, and proves that there are no further regular solids.       [ edit ]   Missing axioms   The  Elements  tacitly assumes several axioms that it does not explicitly state. For example, in the first construction of Book 1, Euclid used a premise that was neither postulated nor proved: that two circles with centers at the distance of their radius will intersect in two points. Later, in the fourth construction, he used the movement of triangles to prove that if two sides and their angles are equal, then they are congruent; however, he did not postulate or even define movement.   Richard Dedekind  and  David Hilbert  reformulated the axioms of the  Elements , by adding extra axioms such as an axiom of continuity and an axiom of congruence, to make the axioms of Euclidean geometry complete.  Hilbert's axioms  were not first order and so depended implicitly on either set theory or  second order logic , but Tarski later gave  Tarski's axioms , a complete first order set of axioms for Euclidean geometry.   Mathematician and historian  W. W. Rouse Ball  put the criticisms in perspective, remarking that ""the fact that for two thousand years [the  Elements ] was the usual text-book on the subject raises a strong presumption that it is not unsuitable for that purpose."" [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Apocrypha   It was not uncommon in ancient time to attribute to celebrated authors works that were not written by them. It is by these means that the  apocryphal  books XIV and XV of the  Elements  were sometimes included in the collection. [ 14 ]  The spurious Book XIV was likely written by  Hypsicles  on the basis of a treatise by  Apollonius . The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres, with the chief result being that the ratio of the surfaces of the  dodecahedron  and  icosahedron  inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being  .

Alexandria, Egypt Greek mathematician   The Greek mathematician (math expert) Euclid wrote the  Elements,  a thirteen-volume set of textbooks of geometry (the study of points, lines, angles, and surfaces)—the oldest major mathematical work existing in the Western world.     Unknown background   Almost nothing is known of Euclid personally. It is not even known for certain whether he was really a creative mathematician or was simply good at collecting and editing the work of others. Most of the information about Euclid comes from Proclus (411–485 C. E.), a fifth-century Greek scholar. Some believed Euclid was the son of a Greek man who was born in Tyre and lived in Damascus. His mathematical education may have been obtained from students of Plato (c. 427  B.C.E. –347  B.C.E. ) in Athens, Greece, since most of the earlier mathematicians upon whose work the  Elements  is based had studied and taught there.       The  Elements   No earlier writings similar to the  Elements  have survived. One reason is that the  Elements  expanded on all previous writings of this type, so keeping any earlier texts around was thought to be unnecessary. For example, about 600  B.C.E.  the Greek mathematician  Thales (c. 625–c. 546  B.C.E. ) is said to have discovered a number of theorems (statements that can be demonstrated or proved) that appear in the  Elements.  Early mathematics dealt only with concrete problems, such as determining areas and volumes. By Euclid's time, mathematics had become more of an intellectual occupation for philosophers (thinkers, or seekers of wisdom) rather than for only scientists.   The  Elements  consists of thirteen books. Each book contains a number of theorems, from about ten to one hundred, which follow a series of definitions. The usual elementary course in Euclidean geometry is based on ""Book I."" ""Book V"" is one of the finest works in Greek mathematics, a masterful description of the theory of proportions (the relation of one part to another part or the sum of all parts) originally discovered by Eudoxus. ""Book VI"" applies the statements of ""Book V"" to the figures of plane geometry (the study of flat surfaces and the relationships of figures lying within the surfaces). In ""Book VII"" a prime number is defined as that which is measured by a unit alone (a prime number can be divided only by itself and the number 1). ""Book IX"" contains Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers, which is still used in current algebra textbooks.   The  Elements  were translated into Latin and Arabic, but it was not until the first printed edition, published in 1482, that they became important in European education. The first complete English version was printed in 1570. It was during the most active mathematical period in England, about 1700, that Greek mathematics was studied most closely. Euclid's writings were used by        Euclid.   Courtesy of the   Library of Congress .     all major mathematicians, including Isaac Newton (1642–1727). The growing importance of the sciences and mathematics in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries helped Euclid's ideas keep their influence in schools and universities throughout the Western (having to do with nations of Europe and America) world.       Euclid's other works   Some of Euclid's other works are known only because other writers have mentioned them. The book  Data  discusses plane geometry and contains propositions (problems to be demonstrated) in which certain data are  given about a figure and from which other data can be figured out. Euclid's  On Division,  also dealing with plane geometry, is concerned with more general problems of division. A work by Euclid that has survived is  Phaenomena.  This is what today would be called applied mathematics, concerning the geometry of spheres for use in astronomy.   Another surviving work, the  Optics,  corrects the belief held at the time that the sun and other heavenly bodies are actually the size they appear to be to the eye. This work discusses the relationship between what the eye sees of an object and what the object actually is. For example, the eye always sees less than half of a sphere, and as the observer moves closer to the sphere, the part of it that is seen is decreased, although it appears larger.   Another lost work is the  Porisms.  A porism is somewhere between a theorem and a problem; that is, rather than something to be proved or something to be constructed, a porism is concerned with bringing out another feature of something that is already there. To find the center of a circle or to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers are examples of porisms. This work appears to have been more advanced than the  Elements,  and perhaps if it still existed it would give Euclid a higher place in the history of mathematics.

He was active in  Alexandria  during the reign of  Ptolemy I  (323 BC  283 BC). His work  Elements  is the most successful  textbook  in the  history of mathematics . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  In it, the principles of what is now called  Euclidean geometry  were deduced from a small set of  axioms . Euclid also wrote works on  perspective ,  conic sections ,  spherical geometry ,  number theory  and  rigor .

The biographical information that we do have comes largely from commentaries by  Proclus  and  Pappus of Alexandria . Euclid was active at the great  Library of Alexandria  and may have studied at  Plato's Academy  in  Greece . The date and place of Euclid's birth and the date and circumstances of his death are unknown.   Some writers in the  Middle Ages  confused him with  Euclid of Megara , a Greek  Socratic   philosopher  who lived approximately one century earlier. [ 3 ]     The  Elements       Main article:  Euclid's Elements              One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's  Elements , found at  Oxyrhynchus  and dated to circa AD 100. The diagram accompanies Book II, Proposition 5. [ 4 ]       Although many of the results in  Elements  originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later. [ citation needed ]   Although best-known for its geometric results, the  Elements  also includes  number theory . It considers the connection between  perfect numbers  and  Mersenne primes , the infinitude of  prime numbers ,  Euclid's lemma  on factorization (which leads to the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic  on uniqueness of  prime factorizations ), and the  Euclidean algorithm  for finding the  greatest common divisor  of two numbers.   The geometrical system described in the  Elements  was long known simply as  geometry , and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as  Euclidean geometry  to distinguish it from other so-called  Non-Euclidean geometries  that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.       Other works          Euclid, as imagined by  Raphael  in this detail from  The School of Athens . No likeness or description of Euclid's physical appearance made during his lifetime survived antiquity. Therefore, Euclid's depiction in works of art depends on the artist's imagination.       In addition to the  Elements , at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day. They follow the same logical structure as  Elements , with definitions and proved propositions.     Data  deals with the nature and implications of ""given"" information in geometrical problems; the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the  Elements .   On Divisions of Figures , which survives only partially in  Arabic  translation, concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given  ratios . It is similar to a third century AD work by  Heron of Alexandria .   Catoptrics , which concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors. The attribution to Euclid is doubtful. Its author may have been  Theon of Alexandria .   Phenomena , a treatise on  spherical astronomy , survives in Greek; it is quite similar to  On the Moving Sphere  by  Autolycus of Pitane , who flourished around 310 BC.   Optics  is the earliest surviving Greek treatise on perspective. In its definitions Euclid follows the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by discrete rays which emanate from the eye. One important definition is the fourth: ""Things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal."" In the 36         Statue of Euclid in the  Oxford University Museum of Natural History      propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. Proposition 45 is interesting, proving that for any two unequal magnitudes, there is a point from which the two appear equal.  Pappus  believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's  Optics , along with his  Phaenomena , in the  Little Astronomy , a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the  Syntaxis  ( Almagest ) of  Claudius Ptolemy .     Other works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.     Conics  was a work on  conic sections  that was later extended by  Apollonius of Perga  into his famous work on the subject. It is likely that the first four books of Apollonius's work come directly from Euclid. According to Pappus, ""Apollonius, having completed Euclid's four books of conics and added four others, handed down eight volumes of conics."" The Conics of Apollonius quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid's work was already lost.   Porisms  might have been an outgrowth of Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is controversial.   Pseudaria , or  Book of Fallacies , was an elementary text about errors in  reasoning .   Surface Loci  concerned either  loci  (sets of points) on surfaces or loci which were themselves surfaces; under the latter interpretation, it has been hypothesized that the work might have dealt with  quadric surfaces .   Several works on  mechanics  are attributed to Euclid by Arabic sources.  On the Heavy and the Light  contains, in nine definitions and five propositions, Aristotelian notions of moving bodies and the concept of specific gravity.  On the Balance  treats the theory of the lever in a similarly Euclidean manner, containing one definition, two axioms, and four propositions. A third fragment, on the circles described by the ends of a moving lever, contains four propositions. These three works complement each other in such a way that it has been suggested that they are remnants of a single treatise on mechanics written by Euclid.

He was active in  Alexandria  during the reign of  Ptolemy I  (323 BC  283 BC). His work  Elements  is the most successful  textbook  in the  history of mathematics . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  In it, the principles of what is now called  Euclidean geometry  were deduced from a small set of  axioms . Euclid also wrote works on  perspective ,  conic sections ,  spherical geometry ,  number theory  and  rigor .

The biographical information that we do have comes largely from commentaries by  Proclus  and  Pappus of Alexandria . Euclid was active at the great  Library of Alexandria  and may have studied at  Plato's Academy  in  Greece . The date and place of Euclid's birth and the date and circumstances of his death are unknown.   Some writers in the  Middle Ages  confused him with  Euclid of Megara , a Greek  Socratic   philosopher  who lived approximately one century earlier. [ 3 ]     The  Elements       Main article:  Euclid's Elements              One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's  Elements , found at  Oxyrhynchus  and dated to circa AD 100. The diagram accompanies Book II, Proposition 5. [ 4 ]       Although many of the results in  Elements  originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later. [ citation needed ]   Although best-known for its geometric results, the  Elements  also includes  number theory . It considers the connection between  perfect numbers  and  Mersenne primes , the infinitude of  prime numbers ,  Euclid's lemma  on factorization (which leads to the  fundamental theorem of arithmetic  on uniqueness of  prime factorizations ), and the  Euclidean algorithm  for finding the  greatest common divisor  of two numbers.   The geometrical system described in the  Elements  was long known simply as  geometry , and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as  Euclidean geometry  to distinguish it from other so-called  Non-Euclidean geometries  that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.       Other works          Euclid, as imagined by  Raphael  in this detail from  The School of Athens . No likeness or description of Euclid's physical appearance made during his lifetime survived antiquity. Therefore, Euclid's depiction in works of art depends on the artist's imagination.       In addition to the  Elements , at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day. They follow the same logical structure as  Elements , with definitions and proved propositions.     Data  deals with the nature and implications of ""given"" information in geometrical problems; the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the  Elements .   On Divisions of Figures , which survives only partially in  Arabic  translation, concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given  ratios . It is similar to a third century AD work by  Heron of Alexandria .   Catoptrics , which concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors. The attribution to Euclid is doubtful. Its author may have been  Theon of Alexandria .   Phenomena , a treatise on  spherical astronomy , survives in Greek; it is quite similar to  On the Moving Sphere  by  Autolycus of Pitane , who flourished around 310 BC.   Optics  is the earliest surviving Greek treatise on perspective. In its definitions Euclid follows the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by discrete rays which emanate from the eye. One important definition is the fourth: ""Things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal."" In the 36         Statue of Euclid in the  Oxford University Museum of Natural History      propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. Proposition 45 is interesting, proving that for any two unequal magnitudes, there is a point from which the two appear equal.  Pappus  believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's  Optics , along with his  Phaenomena , in the  Little Astronomy , a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the  Syntaxis  ( Almagest ) of  Claudius Ptolemy .     Other works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.     Conics  was a work on  conic sections  that was later extended by  Apollonius of Perga  into his famous work on the subject. It is likely that the first four books of Apollonius's work come directly from Euclid. According to Pappus, ""Apollonius, having completed Euclid's four books of conics and added four others, handed down eight volumes of conics."" The Conics of Apollonius quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid's work was already lost.   Porisms  might have been an outgrowth of Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is controversial.   Pseudaria , or  Book of Fallacies , was an elementary text about errors in  reasoning .   Surface Loci  concerned either  loci  (sets of points) on surfaces or loci which were themselves surfaces; under the latter interpretation, it has been hypothesized that the work might have dealt with  quadric surfaces .   Several works on  mechanics  are attributed to Euclid by Arabic sources.  On the Heavy and the Light  contains, in nine definitions and five propositions, Aristotelian notions of moving bodies and the concept of specific gravity.  On the Balance  treats the theory of the lever in a similarly Euclidean manner, containing one definition, two axioms, and four propositions. A third fragment, on the circles described by the ends of a moving lever, contains four propositions. These three works complement each other in such a way that it has been suggested that they are remnants of a single treatise on mechanics written by Euclid.

clueweb09-enwp01-47-22054	"                     Parallel postulate          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Parallelism axiom )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 If the sum of the interior angles  and  is less than 180, the two straight lines, produced indefinitely, meet on that side.       In  geometry , the  parallel postulate , also called  Euclid 's fifth postulate  because it is the fifth postulate in  Euclid's  Elements , is a distinctive  axiom  in what is now called  Euclidean geometry . It states that:     If a  line segment  intersects two straight  lines  forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two  right angles , then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.     Euclidean geometry  is the study of geometry that satisfies all of Euclid's axioms,  including  the parallel postulate. A geometry where the parallel postulate cannot hold is known as a  non-euclidean geometry . Geometry that is  independent  of Euclid's fifth postulate (i.e., only assumes the first four postulates) is known as  absolute geometry  (or, in other places known as neutral geometry).

Euclid did not postulate the  converse  of his fifth postulate, which is one way to distinguish Euclidean geometry from  elliptic geometry . The Elements contains the proof of an equivalent statement (Book I, Proposition 17):  Any two  angles  of a  triangle  are together less than two  right angles .  The proof depends on an earlier proposition:  In a triangle ABC, the  exterior angle  at C is greater than either of the  interior angles  A or B . This in turn depends on Euclid's unstated assumption that two straight lines meet in only one point, a statement not true of elliptic geometry.   In other words, the converse of the fifth postulate follows from Euclid's axioms minus the fifth postulate, plus an axiom stating that two distinct non-parallel straight lines meet in only one point.     [ edit ]   Logically equivalent properties   Euclid's parallel postulate is equivalent to Playfair's axiom, named after the Scottish  mathematician   John Playfair , which states:     At most one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line  parallel  to the given line in a plane. [ 1 ]     Many other equivalent statements to the parallel postulate or to Playfair's axiom have been suggested, some of them appearing at first to be unrelated to parallelism, and some seeming so  self-evident  that they were  unconsciously  assumed by people who claimed to have proven the parallel postulate from Euclid's other postulates.     The sum of the  angles  in every  triangle  is 180.   There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180.   The sum of the angles is the same for every triangle.   There exists a pair of  similar , but not  congruent , triangles.   Every triangle can be  circumscribed .   If three angles of a  quadrilateral  are  right angles , then the fourth angle is also a right angle.   There exists a quadrilateral of which all angles are right angles.   There exists a pair of straight lines that are at constant  distance  from each other.   Two lines that are parallel to the same line are also parallel to each other.   Given two parallel lines, any line that intersects one of them also intersects the other.   In a  right-angled triangle , the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides ( Pythagoras' Theorem ).   There is no upper limit to the  area  of a triangle.  [1]     However, the alternatives which employ the word ""parallel"" cease appearing so simple when one is obliged to explain which of the three common definitions of ""parallel"" is meant - constant separation, never meeting or same angles where crossed by a third line - since the equivalence of these three is itself one of the unconsciously obvious assumptions equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate.     [ edit ]   History   For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. The main reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that the fifth postulate isn't self-evident unlike the other postulates. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it. [ 2 ]   Ibn al-Haytham  (Alhazen) (965-1039), an  Iraqi mathematician , made the first attempt at proving the parallel postulate using a  proof by contradiction , [ 3 ]  where he introduced the concept of  motion  and  transformation  into geometry. [ 4 ]  He formulated the  Lambert quadrilateral , which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the ""Ibn al-HaythamLambert quadrilateral"", [ 5 ]  and his attempted proof also shows similarities to  Playfair's axiom . [ 6 ]   Omar Khayym  (1050-1123) made the first attempt at formulating a non-Euclidean  postulate  as an alternative to the parallel postulate, [ 7 ]  and he was the first to consider the cases of  elliptical geometry  and  hyperbolic geometry , though he excluded the latter. [ 8 ]  The  Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral  was also first considered by Omar Khayyam in the late 11th century in Book I of  Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid . [ 5 ]  Unlike many commentators on Euclid before and after him (including  Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri ), Khayyam was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such but to derive it from an equivalent postulate: ""Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge."" [ 9 ]  He recognized that three possibilities arose from omitting Euclid's Fifth; if two perpendiculars to one line cross another line, judicious choice of the last can make the internal angles where it meets the two perpendiculars equal (it is then parallel to the first line). If those equal internal angles are right angles, we get Euclid's Fifth; otherwise, they must be either acute or obtuse. He persuaded himself that the acute and obtuse cases lead to contradiction, but had made a tacit assumption equivalent to the fifth to get there.   Nasir al-Din al-Tusi  (1201-1274), in his  Al-risala al-shafiya'an al-shakk fi'l-khutut al-mutawaziya  ( Discussion Which Removes Doubt about Parallel Lines ) (1250), wrote detailed critiques of the parallel postulate and on Khayym's attempted proof a century earlier. Nasir al-Din attempted to derive a proof by contradiction of the parallel postulate. [ 10 ]  He was also one of the first to consider the cases of elliptical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, though he ruled out both of them. [ 8 ]          Euclidean, elliptical and hyperbolic geometry. The Parallel Postulate is satisfied only for models of Euclidean geometry.       Nasir al-Din's son, Sadr al-Din (sometimes known as ""Pseudo-Tusi""), wrote a book on the subject in 1298, based on Nasir al-Din's later thoughts, which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. ""He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the  Elements ."" [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  His work was published in  Rome  in 1594 and was studied by European geometers. This work marked the starting point for Saccheri's work on the subject. [ 10 ]   Giordano Vitale  (1633-1711), in his book  Euclide restituo  (1680, 1686), used the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant.  Girolamo Saccheri  (1667-1733) pursued the same line of reasoning more thoroughly, correctly obtaining absurdity from the obtuse case (proceeding, like Euclid, from the implicit assumption that lines can be extended indefinitely and have infinite length), but failing to debunk the acute case (although he managed to wrongly persuade himself that he had).   Where Khayym and Saccheri had attempted to prove Euclid's fifth by disproving the only possible alternatives, the nineteenth century finally saw mathematicians exploring those alternatives and discovering the  logically consistent  geometries which result. In 1829,  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky  published an account of acute geometry in an obscure Russian journal (later re-published in 1840 in German). In 1831,  Jnos Bolyai  included, in a book by his father, an appendix describing acute geometry, which, doubtlessly, he had developed independently of Lobachevsky.  Carl Friedrich Gauss  had actually studied the problem before that, but he did not publish any of his results. However, upon hearing of Boylai's results in a letter from Bolyai's father,  Farkas Bolyai , he stated:     ""If I commenced by saying that I am unable to praise this work, you would certainly be surprised for a moment. But I cannot say otherwise. To praise it would be to praise myself. Indeed the whole contents of the work, the path taken by your son, the results to which he is led, coincide almost entirely with my meditations, which have occupied my mind partly for the last thirty or thirty-five years."" [ 12 ]     The resulting geometries were later developed by  Lobachevsky ,  Riemann  and  Poincar  into  hyperbolic geometry  (the acute case) and  spherical geometry  (the obtuse case). The  independence  of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by  Eugenio Beltrami  in 1868.     [ edit ]   Criticism   Attempts to logically prove this postulate, rather than the eighth axiom, were criticized by  Schopenhauer , as described in  Schopenhauer's criticism of the proofs of the Parallel Postulate .

clueweb09-en0000-75-11396	"    Not much is known about Euclid's life.  All that can really be said is that he received his mathematical training at Athens from the pupils of Plato,  and that he taught and founded a school in Alexandria.  One thing we do know for sure about Euclid is that his books, ""The Elements"", are the most successful in mathematical history.  In fifteen books he defines modern day geometry.  His textbooks were in use until the 20th century!    The Arabs of the time also thought highly of Euclid.  In Arabic the name of Euclid is pronounced Uclides, which is equivalent to ""key of Geometry"".  Euclid is geometry, now and forever.      RETURN TO GREEK MATHEMATICS HOME PAGE    "
clueweb09-enwp01-84-21898	"                     Short-term memory          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Short-term memory  (sometimes referred to as ""primary  memory "" or ""active memory"") refers to the capacity for holding a small amount of  information  in  mind  in an active, readily available state for a short period of time. The duration of short-term memory (when rehearsal is prevented) is assumed to be in the order of seconds. Estimates of the capacity of short-term memory vary  from about 3 or 4 elements (i.e., words, digits, or letters) to about 9 elements. A commonly-cited capacity is  72  elements. In contrast,  long-term memory  indefinitely stores a seemingly unlimited amount of information.           Contents       1   Existence of a separate store   2   Broadbent's filter theory   3   Relationship to working memory   4   Duration of short-term memory   5   Capacity of short-term memory     5.1   Chunking       6   See also   7   References     7.1   Notes   7.2   Bibliography       8   External links               [ edit ]   Existence of a separate store   A classical model of memory developed in the 1960s assumed that all memories pass from a short-term to a long-term store after a small period of time. This model is referred to as the ""modal model"" and has been most famously detailed by  Atkinson  and  Shiffrin . [ 1 ]  The exact mechanisms by which this transfer takes place, whether all or only some memories are retained permanently, and indeed the existence of a genuine distinction between the two stores, remain controversial topics among experts.   One form of evidence, cited in favor of the separate existence of a short-term store comes from  anterograde amnesia , the inability to learn new facts and episodes. Patients with this form of amnesia, typically caused by damage to the  hippocampus , have intact ability to retain small amounts of information over short time scales (up to 30 seconds) but are dramatically impaired in their ability to form longer-term memories (a famous example is  patient HM ). This is interpreted as showing that the short-term store is spared from amnesia.   Other evidence comes from experimental studies showing that some manipulations (e.g., a distractor task, such as repeatedly subtracting a single-digit number from a larger number following learning) impair memory for the 3 to 5 most recently learned words of a list (presumably still held in short-term memory), while leaving recall for words from earlier in the list (presumably stored in long-term memory) unaffected; other manipulations (e.g., semantic similarity of the words) affect only memory for earlier list words, [ 2 ]  but do not affect memory for the last few words in a list. These results show that different factors affect short term recall (disruption of rehearsal) and long-term recall (semantic similarity). Together, these findings show that long-term memory and short-term memory can vary independently of each other.   Not all researchers agree that short-term and long-term memory are separate systems. Some theorists propose that memory is unitary over all time scales, from milliseconds to years [ 3 ] . Support for the unitary memory hypothesis comes from the fact that it has been difficult to demarcate a clear boundary between short-term and long-term memory. For instance, Tarnow shows that the recall probability vs. latency curve is a straight line from 6 to 600 seconds, with the probability of failure to recall only saturating after 600 seconds  [ 4 ] . If there were really two different memory stores operating in this time frame, one could expect a discontinuity in this curve. Other research has shown that the detailed pattern of recall errors looks remarkably similar for recall of a list immediately after learning (presumably from short-term memory) and recall after 24 hours (necessarily from long-term memory) [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Broadbent's filter theory   Broadbent's theories of  selective attention  and  short-term memory  were developed as digital computers were beginning to become available to the academic community, and were among the first to use computer analogies to make a serious contribution to the analysis of human cognition. They were combined to form what became known as the ""single channel hypothesis"". His Filter Model proposed that the physical characteristics (e.g., pitch, loudness) of an auditorily presented message were used to focus attention to only a single message. Broadbent's Filter model is referred to as an  early selection  model because irrelevant messages are filtered out before the stimulus information is processed for meaning. These and other theories were brought together in his 1958 book ""Perception and Communication"" which remains one of the classic texts of cognitive psychology [ 6 ] .   Accounts for a theoretical filter device, which is located in , between the incoming sensory register, and the short-term memory storage. His theory is based upon the  multi-storage paradigm  of  William James (1890) and later the  Atkinson & Shiffrin's 'multi-store' memory model  (1968). This filter functions together with a buffer, and enables the subject to handle two kinds of stimuli, presented at the same time. One of the inputs is allowed through the filter, while the other is waiting in in the buffer for later processing. The filter prevents overloading of the limited capacity mechanism beyond the filter, which is the  short-term memory [ 7 ] . It is based on the famous cocktail party problem of the British scientist  Colin Cherry , who is trying to explain how we are able to focus our attention towards the  stimuli  which we find most interesting. [ 8 ] Broadbent comes up with the theory based on data from an experiment where three pairs of different digits are presented simultaneously, three digits in one ear and three in the other. Most participants recalled the digits ear by ear, rather than pair by pair. Thus, if 496 were presented to one ear and 852 to the other, the recall would be 496852 rather than 489562.     [ edit ]   Relationship to working memory   The relationship between short-term memory and  working memory  is differently described by various theorists, but it is generally acknowledged that the two concepts are distinct. Working memory is a theoretical framework that refers to structures and processes used for temporarily storing and manipulating information. As such, working memory might also be referred to as working attention. Short-term memory generally refers in a theory-neutral manner to the short term storage of information. Thus while there are short-term memory components to working memory models, the concept of short-term memory is distinct from these more hypothetical concepts. Within  Baddeley 's influential 1986 model of working memory there are two short-term storage mechanisms: the  phonological loop  and the  visuospatial sketchpad . Most of the research referred to here involves the phonological loop, because most of the work done on short-term memory has used verbal material. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in research on  visual short term memory [ 9 ] , and also increasing work on spatial short term memory [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Duration of short-term memory   The most important characteristic of a short-term store is, clearly, that it is short-term  that is, it retains information for a limited amount of time only. Once information makes it past our sensory buffers, it passes into our short term memory, a second system for retaining information on our memories for brief periods of time. Most definitions of short-term memory limit the duration of storage to less than a minute; no more than about 30 seconds, and in some models as little as 2 seconds. Memory that exceeds short-term memory duration limits is regarded as long-term memory.   The limited duration of short-term memory immediately suggests that its contents spontaneously decay over time. The decay assumption is part of many theories of short-term memory, most notably  Baddeley's model of working memory . The decay assumption is usually paired with the idea of rapid  covert rehearsal : In order to overcome the limitation of short-term memory, and retain information for longer, information must be periodically repeated, or rehearsed  either by articulating it out loud, or by mentally simulating such articulation. In this way, the information will re-enter the short-term store and be retained for a further period.   Several researchers, however, dispute that spontaneous decay plays any significant role in forgetting over the short term  [ 11 ] [ 12 ] , and the evidence is far from conclusive [ 13 ] .   Authors doubting that decay causes forgetting from short-term memory often offer as an alternative some form of interference: When several elements (such as digits, words, or pictures) are held in short term memory simultaneously, their representations compete with each other for recall, or degrade each other. Thereby, new content gradually pushes out older content, unless the older content is actively protected against interference by rehearsal or by directing attention to it [ 14 ] .     [ edit ]   Capacity of short-term memory   Whatever the cause or causes of forgetting over the short term may be, there is consensus that it severely limits the amount of new information that we can retain over brief periods of time. This limit is referred to as the finite capacity of short-term memory. The capacity of short-term memory is often called ""memory span"", in reference to a common procedure of measuring it: The experimenter presents lists of items (e.g., digits or words) of increasing length; the tested person's span is determined as the longest list length that she or he can recall correctly in the given order on at least half of all trials.   Prior to the creation of current memory models,  George Miller  argued that human short-term memory has a forward  memory span  of approximately seven items plus or minus two. [ 15 ]  More recent research has shown that this  magical number seven  is roughly accurate for college students recalling lists of digits, but memory span varies widely with populations tested and with material. For example, the ability to recall words in order depends on a number of characteristics of these words: fewer words can be recalled when the words have longer spoken duration; this is known as the  word-length effect , [ 16 ]  or when their speech sounds are similar to each other; this is called the  phonological similarity effect . [ 17 ]  More words can be recalled when the words are highly familiar and/or occur frequently in the language; [ 18 ]  recall performance is also better when all of the words in a list are taken from a single semantic category (such as sports) than when the words are taken from different categories. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Chunking   Chunking is the process in which we can expand our ability to remember things in short term. Chunking is also a process by which a person organize material into meaningful groups.Though the average person may only retain about 72 different units in his or her short term memory,  chunking  can greatly increase a person's recall ability. Through putting each unit into a meaningful word or phrase, a person's recall ability can skyrocket through practice. For example, in recalling a phone number, the person usually chunks the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 814), then a three-digit chunk (123) and lastly a four-digit chunk (4567). This method of remembering phone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits. In one testing session, an All-American cross-country runner was able to recall a string of 79 digits after hearing them only once by chunking them into different running times (e.g. the first four numbers were 1518, a three-mile time.)

clueweb09-enwp01-80-23256	"                     Short-term memory          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Short-term memory  (sometimes referred to as ""primary memory"" or ""active memory"") refers to the capacity for holding a small amount of  information  in  mind  in an active, readily available state for a short period of time. The duration of short-term memory (when rehearsal is prevented) is assumed to be in the order of seconds. Estimates of the capacity of short-term memory vary  from about 3 or 4 elements (i.e., words, digits, or letters) to about 9 elements. A commonly-cited capacity is  72  elements. In contrast,  long-term memory  indefinitely stores a seemingly unlimited amount of information.           Contents       1   Existence of a separate store   2   Broadbent's filter theory   3   Relationship to working memory   4   Duration of short-term memory   5   Capacity of short-term memory     5.1   Chunking       6   See also   7   References     7.1   Notes   7.2   Bibliography       8   External links               [ edit ]   Existence of a separate store   A classical model of memory developed in the 1960s assumed that all memories pass from a short-term to a long-term store after a small period of time. This model is referred to as the ""modal model"" and has been most famously detailed by  Atkinson  and  Shiffrin . [ 1 ]  The exact mechanisms by which this transfer takes place, whether all or only some memories are retained permanantly, and indeed the existence of a genuine distinction between the two stores, remain controversial topics among experts.   One form of evidence, cited in favor of the separate existence of a short-term store comes from  anterograde amnesia , the inability to learn new facts and episodes. Patients with this form of amnesia, typically caused by damage to the  hippocampus , have intact ability to retain small amounts of information over short time scales (up to 30 seconds) but are dramatically impaired in their ability to form longer-term memories (a famous example is  patient HM ). This is interpreted as showing that the short-term store is spared from amnesia.   Other evidence comes from experimental studies showing that some manipulations (e.g., a distractor task, such as repeatedly subtracting a single-digit number from a larger number following learning) impair memory for the 3 to 5 most recently learned words of a list (presumably still held in short-term memory), while leaving recall for words from earlier in the list (presumably stored in long-term memory) unaffected; other manipulations (e.g., semantic similarity of the words) affect only memory for earlier list words, [ 2 ]  but do not affect memory for the last few words in a list. These results show that different factors affect short term recall (disruption of rehearsal) and long-term recall (semantic similarity). Together, these findings show that long-term memory and short-term memory can vary independently of each other.   Not all researchers agree that short-term and long-term memory are separate systems. Some theorists propose that memory is unitary over all time scales, from milliseconds to years [ 3 ] . Support for the unitary memory hypothesis comes from the fact that it has been difficult to demarcate a clear boundary between short-term and long-term memory. For instance, Tarnow shows that the recall probability vs. latency curve is a straight line from 6 to 600 seconds, with the probability of failure to recall only saturating after 600 seconds  [ 4 ] . If there were really two different memory stores operating in this time frame, one could expect a discontinuity in this curve. Other research has shown that the detailed pattern of recall errors looks remarkably similar for recall of a list immediately after learning (presumably from short-term memory) and recall after 24 hours (necessarily from long-term memory) [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Broadbent's filter theory   Broadbent's theories of  selective attention  and  short-term memory  were developed as digital computers were beginning to become available to the academic community, and were among the first to use computer analogies to make a serious contribution to the analysis of human cognition. They were combined to form what became known as the ""single channel hypothesis"". His Filter Model proposed that the physical characteristics (e.g., pitch, loudness) of an auditorily presented message were used to focus attention to only a single message. Broadbent's Filter model is referred to as an  early selection  model because irrelevant messages are filtered out before the stimulus information is processed for meaning. These and other theories were brought together in his 1958 book ""Perception and Communication"" which remains one of the classic texts of cognitive psychology [ 6 ] .   Accounts for a theoretical filter device, which is located in , between the incoming sensory register, and the short-term memory storage. His theory is based upon the  multi-storage paradigm  of  William James (1890) and later the  Atkinson & Shiffrin's 'multi-store' memory model  (1968). This filter functions together with a buffer, and enables the subject to handle two kinds of stimuli, presented at the same time. One of the inputs is allowed through the filter, while the other is waiting in in the buffer for later processing. The filter prevents overloading of the limited capacity mechanism beyond the filter, which is the  short-term memory [ 7 ] . It is based on the famous cocktail party problem of the British scientist  Colin Cherry , who is trying to explain how we are able to focus our attention towards the  stimuli  which we find most interesting. [ 8 ] Broadbent comes up with the theory based on data from an experiment where three pairs of different digits are presented simultaneously, three digits in one ear and three in the other. Most participants recalled the digits ear by ear, rather than pair by pair. Thus, if 496 were presented to one ear and 852 to the other, the recall would be 496852 rather than 489562.     [ edit ]   Relationship to working memory   The relationship between short-term memory and  working memory  is differently described by various theorists, but it is generally acknowledged that the two concepts are distinct. Working memory is a theoretical framework that refers to structures and processes used for temporarily storing and manipulating information. As such, working memory might also be referred to as working attention. Short-term memory generally refers in a theory-neutral manner to the short term storage of information. Thus while there are short-term memory components to working memory models, the concept of short-term memory is distinct from these more hypothetical concepts. Within  Baddeley 's influential 1986 model of working memory there are two short-term storage mechanisms: the  phonological loop  and the  visuospatial sketchpad . Most of the research referred to here involves the phonological loop, because most of the work done on short-term memory has used verbal material. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in research on  visual short term memory [ 9 ] , and also increasing work on spatial short term memory [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Duration of short-term memory   The most important characteristic of a short-term store is, clearly, that it is short-term  that is, it retains information for a limited amount of time only. Once information makes it past our sensory buffers, it passes into our short term memory, a second system for retaining information on our memories for brief periods of time. Most definitions of short-term memory limit the duration of storage to less than a minute; no more than about 30 seconds, and in some models as little as 2 seconds. Memory that exceeds short-term memory duration limits is regarded as long-term memory.   The limited duration of short-term memory immediately suggests that its contents spontaneously decay over time. The decay assumption is part of many theories of short-term memory, most notably  Baddeley's model of working memory . The decay assumption is usually paired with the idea of rapid  covert rehearsal : In order to overcome the limitation of short-term memory, and retain information for longer, information must be periodically repeated, or rehearsed  either by articulating it out loud, or by mentally simulating such articulation. In this way, the information will re-enter the short-term store and be retained for a further period.   Several researchers, however, dispute that spontaneous decay plays any significant role in forgetting over the short term  [ 11 ] [ 12 ] , and the evidence is far from conclusive [ 13 ] .   Authors doubting that decay causes forgetting from short-term memory often offer as an alternative some form of interference: When several elements (such as digits, words, or pictures) are held in short term memory simultaneously, their representations compete with each other for recall, or degrade each other. Thereby, new content gradually pushes out older content, unless the older content is actively protected against interference by rehearsal or by directing attention to it [ 14 ] .     [ edit ]   Capacity of short-term memory   Whatever the cause or causes of forgetting over the short term may be, there is consensus that it severely limits the amount of new information that we can retain over brief periods of time. This limit is referred to as the finite capacity of short-term memory. The capacity of short-term memory is often called ""memory span"", in reference to a common procedure of measuring it: The experimenter presents lists of items (e.g., digits or words) of increasing length; the tested person's span is determined as the longest list length that she or he can recall correctly in the given order on at least half of all trials.   Prior to the creation of current memory models,  George Miller  argued that human short-term memory has a forward  memory span  of approximately seven items plus or minus two. [ 15 ]  More recent research has shown that this  magical number seven  is roughly accurate for college students recalling lists of digits, but memory span varies widely with populations tested and with material. For example, the ability to recall words in order depends on a number of characteristics of these words: fewer words can be recalled when the words have longer spoken duration; this is known as the  word-length effect , [ 16 ]  or when their speech sounds are similar to each other; this is called the  phonological similarity effect . [ 17 ]  More words can be recalled when the words are highly familiar and/or occur frequently in the language; [ 18 ]  recall performance is also better when all of the words in a list are taken from a single semantic category (such as sports) than when the words are taken from different categories. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Chunking   Chunking is the process in which we can expand our ability to remember things in short term. Chunking is also a process by which a person organize material into meaningful groups.Though the average person may only retain about 72 different units in his or her short term memory,  chunking  can greatly increase a person's recall ability. Through putting each unit into a meaningful word or phrase, a person's recall ability can skyrocket through practice. For example, in recalling a phone number, the person usually chunks the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 814), then a three-digit chunk (123) and lastly a four-digit chunk (4567). This method of remembering phone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits. In one testing session, an All-American cross-country runner was able to recall a string of 79 digits after hearing them only once by chunking them into different running times (e.g. the first four numbers were 1518, a three-mile time.)

clueweb09-en0000-27-01612	"  Euclid :   Euclid (fl. c. 300 BC, Alexandria), the most prominent mathematician of Greco-Roman antiquity, best known for his treatise on geometry, the Elements.    Life and work. Of Euclid's life it is known only that he taught at and founded a school at Alexandria in the time of Ptolemy I Soter, who reigned from 323 to 285/283 BC. Medieval translators and editors often confused him with the philosopher Eucleides of Megara, a contemporary of Plato about a century before, and therefore called him Megarensis. Writing in the 5th century AD, the Greek philosopher Proclus told the story of Euclid's reply to Ptolemy, who asked whether there was any shorter way in geometry than that of the Elements--""There is no royal road to geometry."" Another anecdote relates that a student, probably in Alexandria, after learning the very first proposition in geometry, wanted to know what he would get by learning these things, whereupon Euclid called his slave and said, ""Give him threepence since he must needs make gain by what he learns.""    Euclid compiled his Elements from a number of works of earlier men. Among these are Hippocrates of Chios (5th century BC), not to be confused with the physician Hippocrates of Cos (flourished 400 BC). The latest compiler before Euclid was Theudius, whose textbook was used in the Academy and was probably the one used by Aristotle. The older elements were at once superseded by Euclid's and then forgotten. For his subject matter Euclid doubtless drew upon all his predecessors, but it is clear that the whole design of his work was his own. He evidently altered the arrangement of the books, redistributed propositions among them and invented new proofs if the new order made the earlier proofs inapplicable. Thus, while Book X was mainly the work of the Pythagorean Theaetetus (flourished 369 BC), the proofs of several theorems in this book had to be changed in order to adapt them to the new definition of proportion developed by Eudoxus (q.v.). According to Proclus, Euclid incorporated into his work many discoveries of Eudoxus and Theaetetus. Most probably Books V and XII are the work of Eudoxus, X and XIII of Theaetetus. Book V expounds the very influential theory of proportion that is applicable to commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes alike (those whose ratios can be expressed as the quotient of two integers and those that cannot).  The main theorems of Book XII state that circles are to one another as the squares of their diameters and that spheres are to each other as the cubes of their diameters. These theorems are certainly the work of Eudoxus, who proved them with his ""method of exhaustion,"" by which he continuously subdivided a known magnitude until it approached the properties of an unknown. Book X deals with irrationals of different classes. Apart from some new proofs and additions, the contents of Book X are the work of Theaetetus; so is most of Book XIII, in which are described the five regular solids, earlier identified by the Pythagoreans. Euclid seems to have incorporated a finished treatise of Theaetetus on the regular solids into his Elements.  Book VII, dealing with the foundations of arithmetic, is a self-consistent treatise, written most probably before 400 BC.   Excerpt from the Encyclopedia Britannica without permission.    "
