What is a Septic System   A ""septic system,"" also referred to as a private, on-site waste disposal system, receives waste water and solids from a building's plumbing facilities (bathrooms, kitchens, shower, laundry), treats, and then disposes of the effluent from this waste, by permitting it to absorb into soils at the property. ""Treatment"" is accomplished by bacterial action in the ""septic"" or ""treatment"" tank and it is mostly accomplished by bacteria in the soil around and below the effluent absorption system, or ""drain field."" This bacterial action is needed to reduce the level of pathogens in the effluent discharges from the waste system into the soil. The principal components of a private on-site waste disposal system usually include the following:       piping connecting the building to the treatment tank   a septic or treatment tank which retains solid waste   piping connecting and conducting clarified effluent from the treatment tank to a distribution box   a distribution box connecting the effluent line from the tank to the absorption system or ""drain field""   an absorption system which permits effluent to drain to soils below   a bio-mat or bio-mass of pathogen-digesting bacteria which forms in soil below the absorption system.     Many variations on this general scheme are used, depending on local climate, soil conditions, available space, economy, and available materials. Special equipment and systems may be designed for problem or difficult sites such as rocky or wet ground, permafrost, or wet tropical marshlands.

SAFETY WARNINGS - Septic Tank Safety Warnings for Septic Inspectors, Septic Pumpers, and Homeowners   This chapter is maintained at  Septic System, Septic Tank, &  Cesspool Safety Warnings for Septic Inspectors, Septic Pumpers, and Homeowners  but text is repeated here for readers who scroll down rather than linking to the separate chapter.   Providing inspection and diagnosis of on-site waste disposal systems is an extremely valuable public service which helps protect people from expensive unanticipated septic system repair costs and helps protect public health by assuring sanitary disposal of sewage and gray water waste from buildings. More importantly though, such inspections may detect and warn about serious safety hazards at some properties. The strong warnings issued below intend to reduce septic system safety hazards for inspectors and property owners/occupants, but it is not the author's intention to dissuade inspectors from providing this valuable service. But danger lurks at cesspools, open covers, tanks or tank covers in poor condition, and from high levels of methane gas. These risk collapse, falling, asphyxiation, and other potentially  fatal hazards  as well as risks of unsanitary conditions.     Don't work alone:  Falling into a septic tank or even leaning over a septic tank can be fatal. Do not work on or at septic tanks alone - workers can become suddenly overcome by methane gas.   Do not ever go into a septic tank  unless you are specially trained and are wearing the special equipment and gear for that purpose, including self-contained breathing apparatus.   Don't enter the septic tank : Never go into a septic tank to retrieve someone who has fallen in and was overcome by toxic gases without a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). if a SCBA is not available, call for emergency services and put a fan at the top of the tank to blow in fresh air.   Don't lean over the septic tank openings  Do not lean over or stick your head into the septic tank to examine its interior - you could fall in to the tank or become overcome by gases and fall into the tank, an event which is likely to be fatal.   Don't ignite flames  Do not light a flame at or near the tank - methane gas is explosive. At one tank pumpout my client described the explosion and burns received by the pumping contractor when he stood by the tank and lit a cigarette.   Site must be ventilated : Decomposing wastes in the septic tank produce toxic gases (such as methane) which can kill a human in a matter of minutes. When working on a tank be sure the area is well ventilated.   Rope off & Mark Dangerous Sites : If your inspection discover that there are dangerous conditions, such as an unsafe tank cover, tank collapse, or a home-made septic tank or cesspool (which are at increased risk of sudden collapse) such areas should be roped off and clearly marked as dangerous to prevent access until proper evaluation and repairs can be made.   Safe covers : be sure that the tank and its access ports have sound and secure covers that do not risk collapse and which cannot be removed by children.   Septic & Cesspool Collapse Hazards : Old steel tanks, thin, rusting steel or rotting home-made wood tank covers, site-built tanks and cesspools, and recently-pumped cesspools are at particular risk of collapse. Falling into a septic tank or cesspool is likely to lead to rapid asphyxiation from methane and in cases of collapse, there is risk of becoming buried. The author has consulted in cases involving such fatalities (homeowner fell into a site-built cesspool), and at one site inspection, walking near an overgrown area the author himself stepped through a rusting steel septic tank top, surviving only by throwing himself into a nearby clump of brambles!  Beware of       flimsy, rusted, old-steel, home-made, or missing septic tank/drywell/cesspool covers    abandoned systems which may not have been filled-in    collapsed, or collapsing septic tanks or cesspools    possible presence of multiple components at a property, abandoned or in-use        Unsanitary conditions : Be alert for unsanitary conditions such as surface effluent or sewage backups into buildings, events which risk serious viral and bacterial hazards and which indoors, may require professional cleaning. Be alert for personal sanitation hazards when working around septic systems, such as open cuts or failure to wash properly after working on systems.   Damage to Septic Components : Avoid damaging septic system components or the building: Improper septic testing procedures, such as flooding a dosing-system, can damage the system. Also, remember to check for leaks into or under the building being tested when running water into the building fixtures and drains. Don't leave water running unattended - at risk of flooding the building.      Septic Systems Online Book    Septic System Safety Warnings for Home Owners and Home Buyers    Septic system concerns for a building owner start with safety. Here are some red flags:     Signs of collapse-possible fatal hazards:  include depressions or ""soil subsidence"" anywhere on or around the property. Any suspect area should be roped-off and absolutely no one should walk over or even close to such a spot until it has been investigated by a professional.   Old or abandoned systems:  such as site-built cesspools or drywells were often made with a thin steel or wood cover which with age can collapse. If the history of the site or visual observation suggests that there are or were old systems at the property, professional investigation is warranted. Improper ""abandonment"" (failing to fill-in a pit) can lead to sudden collapses. Signs that there may be old systems at a property might come from anecdotal evidence (ask a neighbor, ask the local septic installing or service companies), or visual evidence such as seeing abandoned waste pipes at basement or crawl space walls or floors. Don't assume that an old house which is now connected to the public sewer didn't previously have an on-site waste disposal system.   Septic service by untrained workers:  such as aerating, agitating, or pumping out an old site-built cesspool, can lead to sudden system collapse. Prevent access over or near any such systems.   Unsanitary conditions  such as discharge of sewage effluent to the yard surface, to a nearby well or stream, or previous septic backups into a building deserve professional attention. Indoors special cleaning may be needed to remove bacteria or other pathogens.    Septic testing by inexpert ""inspectors""  who may not follow an adequate procedure increases the risk of a costly surprise.   Uninformed homeowners may not notice a danger or malfunction .Homeowners  should review the  safety warnings listed above . The information here is general in nature. Since conditions and requirements vary widely at individual sites, the you should obtain qualified expert advice pertaining to the specific system about which you have questions, and should not rely on this general text for costly diagnostic/repair/replacement decisions. In other words, I'll try to give you some helpful information. In exchange, don't expect me to pay for your new septic system.     Septic Systems Online Book   Septic Inspector Qualifications/Licensing    If you perform septic inspections you are obligated to do so with proper information, training, procedures, and in some communities a license is required. Some states (e.g. CA, CT, NJ, MA) have specific certification requirements for inspectors of septic systems, as well as specific regulations regarding the performance of the inspection itself. Be sure to obtain information pertinent to your own state, usually from the state health department or state department of environmental protection. For example, Massachusetts septic inspectors will want to look at the links and the Title 5 regulations at our page on   the Massachusetts Septic Testing Law . Other links to septic system installation and inspection regulatory agencies are at our  ""Local, State, U.S. Federal Government, & International Agencies   & Resources for Septic Systems Wastewater Treatment"" page.    Septic System Inspection Authorities    INSPECTION AUTHORITY: some municipalities and states (EG. Pennsylvania) provide septic inspection and testing certification. However a generalist inspector such as an ASHI professional, in the course of a home inspection, is permitted to observe and report visual evidence of defects, probable, or possible defects, just as any contractor might observe and report when coming to a property for any reason. For municipalities requiring certification of septic test providers, home inspectors should consult with local officials for further advice.Note: some authorities, such as New Jersey Administrative Code 7:9-3.17 (b)5 require septic system evaluations to be performed only by a licensed professional engineer, licensed health officer, licensed sanitary engineer, or trained technician under supervision of the septic system inspector as defined in the pertinent code. However our review of these codes finds them probably unenforceable since in some instances the codes contradict themselves (see quote below) or the code agencies provide homeowner pamphlets calling for annual inspections which are made by the homeowner him or her self. ""All testing of operating systems which requires a hydraulic loading which is in excess of the design flow shall be performed under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer."" (New Jersey EPA, Sub 12, 7:9A-12.7 System Testing."") Some codes also require that the details of the septic evaluation procedure itself be included in the report. [Information courtesy of Ed Fitzgerald, ASHI.]  The next chapters discuss ways in which septic system components fail, and with the inspection of the individual septic system components.

This chapter discusses detailed ""how to"" steps instructing the investigator in how to inspect specific septic components for signs of failure. The following section will discuss types and causes of septic failure and will provide criteria that define ""failure.""   Before digging up your septic tank or calling a septic pumper, if you think the septic system is failed because of drain blockage or drains backing up into the building, you should to see   ""Diagnosing Clogged Drains:  Is it a blocked drain or the septic system? - A First Step for Homeowners"". If you link to that text, please return here using your browser's ""BACK"" button.    Onsite Waste Disposal System Failure Criteria   Massachusetts Title 5 lists specific failure criteria and serves as a good model for septic inspections anywhere.     Backup anywhere in the system    Discharge of effluent to the surface, stream, etc. regardless of whether or not septic dye is observed    Static effluent level or floating scum over the top of the baffles in the septic tank [added by DF]    Static effluent level above outlet in the D-box    System has to be pumped more than 4x/year    Metal septic tanks (municipality dependent; note that in special site conditions small metal tanks may be the ""only"" solution and may be approved by local officials. An owner/buyer must be informed of the implications of such installations.)    Soil Absorption System (or cesspool, etc) is at a depth exposing it to the maximum groundwater level     Septic Systems Online Book   Inspecting Outside Waste Piping   Outside waste piping conducts sewage (black water and gray water) from the building to the treatment tank or ""septic tank,"" and from the treatment tank to the distribution box. These lines should be of solid, non-perforated material and need to be protected from mechanical damage (such as by vehicles). Piping extending from the distribution box into drain fields is normally perforated, though solid lines might be used if effluent is being processed by more specialized devices such as seepage pits, galleys, or a sand-bed system.    House to tank   This line may become blocked by waste, damaged by collapse of a section, or invaded by roots. Detection of these conditions is fairly easy by routing a snake or power snake from the building drain to the septic tank. An experienced power snake operator can often tell by ""feel"" that a drain line is collapsed, partially collapsed, or invaded by roots. While you may make a temporary ""repair"" of such a condition by drain-cleaning, if the line is broken or root-invaded, you should expect to have to excavate and replace it soon.    Tank to Distribution Box   The same failures can occur on this line as from house to tank. Opening the D-box can also show whether or not effluent is being directed uniformly into each of the leach lines. A tipped D-box can overload one line and cause early failure of the absorption system. If this is happening, flow adjustment end-caps (eccentric  holes) can be installed in the distribution box on the inlet end of each of the drain lines, permitting adjustment of effluent delivery into each line, perhaps relieving the problem line and redistributing effluent into the others.    Drain field piping   In a conventional ""drain field"" of perforated pipes buried in gravel-filled trenches, a drain line may be invaded by tree roots. This is why experts advise keeping tree and shrub plantings away from drain fields. Vehicle traffic can also collapse this or any outdoor waste piping, which is why experts advise against ever driving over a drainfield or over any other septic system components.

The purpose of the treatment tank or ""septic tank"" is to contain solid waste and to permit the beginning of bacterial action to process sewage into a combination of clarified effluent, settled sludge, or floating scum in the tank. An intact, un-damaged septic tank is normally always filled with these materials. However the inspector performing a ""visual"" check of the septic system needs to be alert for some important findings:      Subsidence at the tank location - may risk dangerous, potentially fatal collapse   Evidence of recent work   Evidence of backup or effluent breakout at the surface in the tank area       Only by pumping and visual inspection can actual tank capacity and condition be completely determined. Probing in the area of a tank, without excavation, is not recommended as the probe may damage a steel or fiberglass tank. When a tank is uncovered for pumping additional critical details may be observed before the pumping operation      Condition and safety of the tank and access covers   Liquid and waste level in the tank - evidence of waste passing over the baffles - a flooded system, an indicator of system failure   damage to the tank baffles      When the tank is opened and to be cleaned or pumped out additional information is available:      Thickness of scum and sludge levels: Septic tank maximum scum and sludge buildup prior to pump out, and instructions for measuring the floating scum layer thickness and settled sludge layer thickness in a septic tank are available in a separate chapter at  Septic Tank Pumping Guide   Back-flow of effluent into the tank during pumpdown - an indicator of flooded leach fields   Additional evidence of damage to the tank baffles   Evidence of damage to the tank itself - cracks, leaks     Septic Systems Online Book   Steel septic tanks    Steel tanks typically last 20-25 years, then rust, and collapse. Before this time steel baffles may rust off (damaging the drain field with sludge) or the tank top may become rusty and unsafe. Since steel tank tops can be replaced while leaving the old tank in place, the condition of the top itself is not a reliable indicator of tank condition.     Rusting steel tank covers can cause death!  Rusted covers can collapse. I have reports of children and adults who have died from this hazard, as recently as December 1997. In 2000 I consulted in a fatality involving an adult falling into a cesspool. At a building inspection I myself stepped through a hidden, rusted-through steel septic tank cover. Falling into a septic tank, drywell, or cesspool is quickly fatal, either from being buried by falling soils and debris, or by asphyxiation. Septic gases are highly toxic and can kill in just minutes of exposure. Even leaning over an empty (just pumped) tank has led to collapse and fatality of a septic pumper.     Steel tank baffles:  rust out and fall off, permitting solids to enter the soil absorption system    Steel tank bottoms rust out  permitting effluent to leak into soils around the tank, possibly giving a large void in tank at time of testing, thus subverting a loading or dye test.    Concrete septic tanks   Concrete tanks at an existing septic installation are usually viable, but might have damaged baffles or cracks that permit seepage of groundwater in or septic effluent out around the tank. Occasionally we've seen tanks made of poor-quality concrete (insufficient portland cement) which eroded badly. If the tank outlet or absorption system have been blocked, examination of the tank interior may show that effluent is or has been above the top of the baffles (see ""baffles"" below) thus indicating a system failure discussed next.    Concrete tanks can crack  or sections may separate causing leaks with the result of not only improper disposal of effluent (wrong location) but also subverting an attempt at a septic loading and dye test since when the system is un-used the tank liquid levels drop abnormally. The inspector may detect this condition only if there is a tank inspection port which is readily and safely accessible for before, during, and after inspection when running a loading and dye test.   Septic Systems Online Book   Home made or ""site built tanks- [TBD]    Site built systems, in my experience, are often under-sized and worse, dangerous. There is a serious risk of collapse of old rotting wood covers, collapsing concrete block dry-laid tank or ""cesspool"" walls, etc. Other types of tanks and home-made onsite systems are described below at   Septic Tank Type, Capacity, Material Details    Baffles: Inspecting the Condition of Septic Tank Baffles   Baffles in a septic tank are provided to keep solids and floating scum and grease inside the tank. Baffles are provided at both the inlet to the tank (from the building) and the outlet from the tank (to the absorption system).     Broken baffles or high sludge levels can cause solids to flow out of the tank and into the absorption system. The result is reduced absorption into surrounding soil and eventual failure of the system. Floating scum thickness and settled solids thickness can be measured through access ports into the tank or cesspool. Finding solids at or covering the outlets or damaged baffles should result in report of a very questionable adsorption system and possible major repair cost.    Concrete tank baffles:  may erode from chemicals, detergents, poor concrete mix, water flowing over top of baffles, or may be broken by improper pumping procedure  "

They keep pathway weeds from        your garden soil, prevent soil compaction, provide good drainage and serve as        a barrier to pests such as slugs and snails.                By raising the soil level, raised beds also reduce back strain when bending        over to tend the bed. Raised beds are  available in a variety of different materials, or they can be made with relative ease.                                                               buy        a ready-made raised bed, or raised bed components                 Note:  To see our full collection of raised beds,  click here .

Lumber:   Use            cedar 2 x 6 for the sides, and 4 x 4 for the corner posts. If you have            wood wider than 2 x 6"", it's fine to use but the overall height of            the bed should be 12"" or less. If cedar is not available, ask your            lumber dealer for locally available weather resistant wood.                            Fastenings:  Use 3.5galvanized 'spiral' nails. You'll need        32 - 40 nails for this project. (3"" galvanized screws can used in        place of nails - they will hold better but are a little more expensive.)                            Size:          The          bed can be made any size you like, but consider:          Width:  4'  should be a maximum width, so it's easy        to reach the middle of the bed.         Length:   The            bed shown   here is 3' x 6'. Raised beds longer              than 6' will require additional stakes in the middle of the two long sides              to keep them from bowing under the weight of the soil.                                  Is treated lumber safe?   Treated          lumber is often used for outdoor projects. Chemicals used to preserve          lumber include organic compounds such as pentachlorophenol, creosote and          coal tars. Other preservatives contain chromated copper arsenate (CCA),          ammonical copper arsenate and acid copper chromate.   There            is growing concern about the dangers of arsenic leaching into the ground            or rubbing off on people's hands from CCA-treated wood.                     U ntil the safety              of treated wood is proven conclusively, we recommend you use a naturally              rot-resistant wood like red cedar, black locust or redwood.                Under most circumstances, these woods will last                  10 - 20 years when used for raised beds. Recycled composite plastic lumber (see below) is another              alternative, and is now available in a variety of sizes and colors.                                                                 construction:                           1.  Cut the 4x 4 to four 18lengths. Sharpen the ends with a handsaw or hatchet.        (This does not have to be pretty - only the worms will see.)                            2.  Assemble        the two short sides first, on a firm, flat surface. Lay two of the sharpened        corner pieces down, set two of the   2 x 6's        on top and line up the edges. Pre-drill the nail holes to avoid splitting        the wood. Be sure the drill bit you use is just a bit thinner than the nails.                                          3.  Stand one of the assembled sides up on its top edge, so the sharpened ends        of the corner posts are pointing up. Set one long piece in place and nail        the one end to the corner post. Now your construction will stand on its        own (upside down) and be easier to finish.                                        4.         Nail the remaining long pieces to the one short side. Set the other short        side in place and finish the job. (If your bed is longer than 6"", you'll                        Flip it over and you're ready to install.                                                                                    raised        bed installation / tips:                                 Double-dig        the bed area.  Turn over the soil to a depth of 16 Leave soil piled up in the center,          away from the sides.            Set            bed in place and tap down corners.  If              the bed has built-in stakes, as in the 'build-your-own' model described              above, drive one corner down a few inches, then go on to the others and              do the same. Repeat this process until bed is at ground level. If you              try to drive one corner all the way down before going on to the others,              you put too much twist on the structure and may split out one of the stakes.         Level          the bed.  Use a level for this task. This            may seem overly meticulous, but after several waterings the soil will            settle to level, and youl want the bed to be the same. Set a stiff board            (2x4) on top of the bed sides, across the span, and set your level on            this board. Tap down the sides as needed till you get a level reading. Be            sure to check for level both along the length and across the width of            your bed.          Burrowing          pests?           If your garden has burrowing pests such as moles, a layer of 1"" poultry            netting (chicken wire) can be laid across the bottom, before soil is added.            The mesh should continue at least 3"" up along the insides  of the bed and be stapled            in place. If you plan to grow root crops, such as potatoes or carrots, you may want to set the chicken wire lower in the ground by digging deeper when you are setting up the bed.               Spread          soil out evenly.              Add any planned soil amendments, such as peat, compost or lime, and spread          the soil evenly across the bed.  Water the bed with an even, fine spray. This will settle the soil;                add more soil to ""top off"". (Over time the soil will settle                an inch or two more.) Rake the bed once more to even out the soil and youe ready to plant.                                   Avoid stepping on the bed.   Once the soil                      is added and the bed is planted, make it a policy to never step on the                      bed. Stepping on the bed will compact the soil, reduce aeration and impact                      root growth. Pets should also be trained to stay off the raised beds.                                 Pathway width.  It helps when                        pathways between raised beds are wide enough for a small wheelbarrow. For grass pathways, make sure they                        are at least wide enough for a weedeater or a small mower. (In our raised bad garden the pathways are 21"" wide.)                                         Mulch the pathways between beds.  Weeding pathways is a nuisance which you can avoid by putting a double layer of perforated landscape cloth over the pathway, and  cover this with a 2- 3"" layer of bark mulch . When laying down the landscape cloth, allow it to come up 1"" against the bottom board of the bed, and staple this to the bed. This will not be visible because the mulch will cover it.                                Some weeds will still appear on your pathways regardless of the mulch. Wait until it rains before pulling them out, or you may rip the landscape cloth. The weeds will come out easily if the ground is wet.                                                                                               Raised        bed supplies:  (to see all our raised beds and supplies,  click here )                                         Composters - choose from 8 different styles         The best ingredient            to put in raised beds is your own compost.

SPACING THE FENCE POSTS                   As a rule, you should set fence posts about 6' to 8' apart. The spacing of the posts depends on the type of fence you build, the terrain, the purpose of the fence and other such factors.                     Set the corner or end post first. Then stretch a line from each corner or end post to align all the posts in between.                     Drive a stake every 6' to 8' at the exact position where the post hole is to be dug (Fig. 1).                     Take time to measure and position the posts accurately. The appearance and the structural strength of your fence depends a great deal on the positioning of the fence posts.                                   STEP 2               FIG. 2                    FIG. 3  - Use a level to make sure each post is in an exact, upright position.                    FIG. 4  - Build a mound around each post to eliminate standing water.                    FIG. 5  - Brace all corner posts in both directions to help them carry weight.                    FIG. 6  - The heads of posts should be rounded, capped or slanted to shed water.             SETTING THE FENCE POSTS                   Set all wood fence posts with about 1/3 of their total length buried in the ground. This is especially important on corner posts and any posts that will carry heavy weight or withstand high wind pressure.                     Use a regular post hole digger to dig the post holes. Dig the holes straight to the proper depth at each stake marker.                     You can anchor the posts more firmly by making the holes slightly larger at the bottom than at the top (Fig. 2). Place a large stone or two shovels full of gravel in the bottom of each hole. This provides drainage to avoid excessive moisture at the base of each post.                     Use a wood preservative to treat the section of the post that will be underground. Allow the post to stand overnight in the preservative so it can become well-saturated.                     You can pack the posts with either dirt or concrete. In either case, place two or three shovels full of gravel in the bottom of each hole before the post is placed into position.                     Be sure the posts are in an exact, upright position (Fig. 3). You can check the alignment of each post with a regular level. You can also check the alignment of the posts in one direction by sighting from one end of the row of posts to the other.                     Brace each post with stakes after it is properly aligned (Fig. 3). Keep the stakes in position until the concrete (if used) has thoroughly set. Remove the nails holding the braces and readjust the post until it is in accurate alignment.                     When the post is properly aligned, tamp it thoroughly to pack the dirt (if used) around the base of the post. Be sure you do not alter the alignment of the post during the tamping process.                     When the post is firmly in position, build a mound around it to help eliminate water standing at the post base (Fig. 4). Slope the concrete slightly away from the post and round it off with a trowel. Tamp the concrete lightly to eliminate any air bubbles left in the mixture that can act as water pockets.                     Provide extra bracing at all corners (Fig. 5). A corner post must carry the weight of fence stretched in two directions, so it should be set in both directions.                     Allow the posts to stand several days and settle firmly in position before adding the fence.                     The heads of posts should be rounded, capped or slanted to help eliminate accumulating water, which can cause rotting (Fig. 6). This is well-worth the effort since it allows the posts to last.                                   STEP 3               FIG. 7  - There are three ways to attach top rails.                    FIG. 8                    FIG. 9 -  Measure from the top rail to align each bottom rail on each post.             ADDING RAILS TO FENCE POSTS                   Attach a top and bottom rail to the fence posts (Fig. 7). There are three basic ways to do this.                     The center illustration shows the top rail being nailed to the top of the post. This is an ideal installation for many types of fencing structures. The top rail can always be joined to another rail in the center of a post this way.                     If the rail is added on the body of the post rather than at the top, attach it with a groove, a wood block or a metal bracket.                     You can attach the bottom rail to the post by either of the two outside illustrations.                     Fig. 8 illustrates several other ways to attach a rail to a fence post. Study these illustrations carefully. The type of joint you use to attach the fence supports to the post depends primarily on the type of fence you are building.                     The lap joint is one of the easiest to use. The grooved joint does basically the same job, but the rail is grooved into the post rather than being nailed to the post surface.                     The butt joint is a little more difficult to make but is often better. The mortised joint is even neater than the butt joint, but you must cut a mortise into the post for this joint.                     The slotted joint is commonly used on decorative fences. Treat all slotted joints with preservative to prevent rotting in the grooved areas.                     Take time to measure from the top rail to be sure the bottom rail on each is in perfect alignment (Fig. 9). After you have measured one post, cut a measuring stick to prevent having to make an actual measurement on each post. The stick can be used to apply the same measurement to each post.                                    STEP 4               FIG. 10  - Fences like these provide a barrier but offer little privacy.                    FIG. 11  - Barriers like these can enhance the appearance of your yard.                    FIG. 12  - These fences are primarily usedto provide privacy.                    FIG. 13  - These four easy-to-build styles of fence have the same basic construction.                    FIG. 14  - Picket fences can be styled in many ways.

FIG. 17  - This board fence is easy to build.              SELECTING THE FENCE STYLE                   There are literally hundreds of variations in fence styles and construction materials. There is pre-assembled wood fencing sections as well as fencing materials made from recycled milk jugs. The type of fence you use depends primarily on the purpose.                     Fences like the type shown in Fig. 10 are used primarily for barriers. They are easy to build and provide an adequate barrier. However, they are usually not very decorative and they provide very little, if any, privacy.                     Fences like those illustrated in Fig. 11 provide barriers and are more attractive than an ordinary fence. With a little shrubbery or plants, such fences can provide very attractive barriers along property lines.                     Fences such as those illustrated in Fig. 12 are primarily privacy screens. They can be built as tall as needed out of many different materials. Their primary purpose is privacy.                     Consider your needs when selecting the style of your fence. If you want a simple barrier, a wire fence or a simple style fence such as illustrated in Fig. 10 will work fine.                     For a barrier that enhances the appearance, consider styles similar to those illustrated in Fig. 11.                     For added privacy, consider the styles illustrated in Fig. 12.                     Regardless of the type of fence you plan to build, be sure you know exactly where your property line is located. If you are uncertain about the location of the line, check into it or work out an agreement on the fence location with your neighbor.                     Also, check any local ordinances applying to fences before beginning construction. Call the building department of your local city hall or ask for the local government office that regulates construction to be sure you abide by city codes.                     Try to keep the bottom rail of any fence at least 2"" above the ground. This helps eliminate the problem of decay and makes it easier to trim grass around the base of the fence.                     Fig. 13 illustrates four basic styles of easy-to-build fence. Each style has the same basic top, center and bottom rail construction. However, the fences look entirely different with the various rail treatments.                     Study the designs in Fig. 13 carefully. Decide which of these styles you prefer, or use a little imagination and create your own fencing design to apply to the basic rail fencing structure.                     Picket fences are very popular and easy to build. With a little ingenuity you can create attractive picket designs. Study the designs in Fig. 14. Use the designs shown in Fig. 14 or your own designs to create a distinctive picket fence.                     Make sure that all the pickets are spaced by inserting a loose picket between the picket previously nailed into position and the picket to be nailed. Use this easy method throughout the entire fencing construction.                     A basket weave fence is often used on a sloping terrain (Fig. 16). This style of fence allows you to raise or lower each post.                     Use a good-quality board to build a basket weave fence. Boards full of knots may break easily when placed under the stress of basket weaving.                     A simple board fence is easy to build and can be quite attractive (Fig. 17). You can place the boards on one side or alternate them from side to side.                     The board fence provides both a barrier and privacy. It can be built as tall as needed and then stained, painted or left natural.                     You can design a siding fence to match the siding on your home of this style. In fact, you can use the same siding that was used on the home to build the fence.                     The siding fence can be covered on one side or both. Then, you can paint it to match or harmonize with the paint on your home.                     These are only a few of the many styles of fencing available. Fences are easy to build, and the materials are readily available.                                       DISCLAIMER: Check your state and local codes before starting any project.

You're out in the fresh air, the project goes quickly, and it gives you a chance to gab with your neighbors. Our basic design sets the boards inside the posts, so both sides look equally good, which your neighbors will appreciate especially if the fence is near the property line. Add lattice to the top of our basic design, and you get a fence that's downright elegant.    Build It Right    In most communities, you don't need a permit to build a fence that's off the property line and 6 feet high or less. But check your local building codes to be sure. Likewise, talk to your neighbors before anything is set (literally) in concrete. You might save yourself a lot of grief.   Softwoods such as redwood, cedar and cypress are best for fences because they resist rot. The Uniform Building Code specifies using either foundation-grade redwood or pressure-treated Douglas fir–larch, in both cases grade No. 2 or better. First-rate, rot-resistant fence wood can be hard to come by, but it's easy to find pressure-treated lumber (also called CCA wood), which has had rot-resisting chemicals forced into it under pressure. Make sure that any wood that touches the ground has a .40 retention rating, which indicates that the chemical treatment is strong enough to protect wood in constant contact with soil or concrete.             Step by Step     1. Lay out the fence.  Locate the ends of the fence and use a hand sledge to drive sturdy stakes or pipes where the end posts will be. Then stretch a mason's line between the stakes. If your fence is 30 feet or more, drive additional stakes every 15 feet or so, aligned with the end stakes. Otherwise, the wind could blow your mason's line and you could end up with a bowed fence. Stretch the mason's line from stake to stake, 3 feet or so above the ground, wrapping it around each stake in the same direction. When you're done, the line should be straight and run along the same face of each stake.           2. Mark and dig the post holes.  With a tape measure and felt-tip marker, measure and mark post locations on the mason's line. For our fence, we spaced posts every 6 feet. Use a plumb bob to plumb these marks down to earth. Mark the post centers on the ground with spray paint or scrap-wood stakes. When you've set the post locations, dig the post holes as shown in the animation, making each hole 2 feet deep and 1 foot wide. (For more on this, see How to Dig a Post Hole.) Note that hand diggers can handle roots up to a half-inch or so, and power diggers can munch through bigger roots and small rocks. But keep a pick and shovel handy you'll need them when the inevitable big rock or root bars your way. Always wear safety glasses when breaking up rock or using a power digger.           3. Set the posts.  Add 6 inches of gravel to each hole and place a 4-by-4 post loosely inside it. (If you're using pressure-treated posts, be sure to place an uncut end in the hole; it's loaded with preservative and will last longer.) Seat each post into the gravel an inch or so, then plumb it with a carpenter's level so that the post face is at least 1/4 inch away from the mason's line above. Then, using one face of the post as a guide, drive a foundation stake diagonally into the dirt near the top of the hole. Hammer an 8d double-headed nail through the stake into the post. Check plumb again, drive a second foundation stake in at a right angle to the first, and nail it to the post. (There are many ways to plumb posts, but we like foundation stakes because they allow you to do the job single-handedly.) Work carefully to ensure that each post is 6 feet apart on center from its neighbors, or board spacing could be a problem.   When you've correctly spaced and plumbed all the posts, fill the holes to within a couple of inches of the top with fence post mix, which already contains cement and aggregate all you have to do is add water. (That's easily done in a wheelbarrow: pour in a bag of fence post mix and add water gradually, stirring with a hoe till you get the right consistency.) Tamp the concrete well with a stick or rod, so that it fills evenly around the post. Let the concrete cure overnight, then remove the double-headed nails from the posts and pull out the foundation stakes. Top off the holes with concrete, this time an inch or two above the ground, sloping the outer rim downward from the post so that water will drain away from the wood. Plain concrete at the base of a post can be pretty ugly: aggregate pressed into the wet concrete looks much better.           4. Trim the post tops.  When all the posts are securely set, stretch a chalk line across them and place a line level at its center. Adjust the line to trim all the posts level at about 1/4 inch below the top of the shortest post. Remove the line level, and snap the chalk line to mark the posts. Cut off the posts with a circular saw using the scrap-wood jig shown to guide the cut.    A Tip to Prevent Splits    To prevent wood from splitting when you nail into it, drill pilot holes using a drill bit that's slightly more than half the thickness of the nail shank you're using. For 16d nails, use a 1/8-inch bit; for 8d nails, use a 3/32-inch bit. This is just a rule of thumb, however. The type of wood you're using and how close to the edge you're drilling ultimately determines whether the wood will split. If your workpiece splits even after you've drilled pilot holes, increase your drill bit size incrementally until you find one that keeps the wood intact.           5. Add the rails.  For the basic fence, nail 2-by-4 top rails into place with 16d galvanized box nails, predrilling to prevent splitting. To minimize the number of joints in the top rails, use 12-foot or 14-foot 2-by-4s. Where the pieces meet atop a post, align them so their ends center over the posts, preferably at a 45-degree angle to protect the end grain and minimize weathering.   Next, mark and cut the lower rails. These rails will last longer if they're at least 6 inches above the ground. Level the rails with the longest level you have, and use a combination square to mark rail locations on the posts. Again, predrill nail holes and toenail the rails to the posts with two 16d box nails at each joint. To keep rails from wandering as you toenail them, clamp a scrap-wood stop block to the post as shown.    6. Add the inner frames and boards.  The boards run vertically between posts and rails within a frame of 1-by-1s, as shown in the upper detail drawing. These frames act as stops for the fence boards so they don't wander when you nail them in.   Add one upper stop first. Measure and cut it to fit between the posts, and predrill nail holes in it every 6 inches. Set your combination square to measure 5/8 inch in from one edge of the upper rail, and then use the square to position the upper stop. Nail the stop into place and use a nailset to sink the nail heads. Next, measure, cut and nail the side stops onto the posts, also 5/8 inch in from the same edge as the upper stop. Finish with the bottom stop.   Next, measure and cut your 1-by-6 fence boards to fit between the upper and lower rails. Lay them across sawhorses, mark them with the combination square, and then cut them with a circular saw or a miter saw. If you want the edges of the boards to meet, just plumb the first one and start nailing them into place, checking plumb periodically. If, on the other hand, you want uniform spaces between boards, mark the spacing in pencil on the bottom rail first, so you can make adjustments before you start to nail. Often, the final board in a fence section will need to be cut to fit widthwise. For this, a table saw is best. Toenail the boards into the rails not the 1-by-1s with 8d finishing nails. (For toenailing, predrill holes at a 45-degree angle.) . With the boards in place, add the remaining 1-by-1 stops to finish the fence.           7. Lattice variation.  This design varies in two ways from the basic fence above: it has a middle rail and a section of lattice between the middle and top rail. Toenail the middle rail before you nail the top rail; clamping a scrap-wood stop block onto the post will keep the middle rail from migrating as you nail it. Follow with the top rail and then the bottom. Since each lattice panel has a frame of 1-by-1 stops on either side to hold it in, you'll need an additional set of 1-by-1s. Because lattice strips are thin and easily split, nail them with 4d nails rather than the 8d nails you're using for the boards. (You can save some money by cutting four 1-foot lattice panels from a single 4-by-8-foot panel.) The lattice is especially beautiful with trumpet creeper or jasmine intertwined through it.

In addition to providing value to your home it increases your security and privacy. You'll find it's not a difficult job and I will show you the easy method of building your fence.                                                                           Building a wood fence can be a fun and rewarding project. In addition to providing value to your home it increases your security and privacy. You'll find it's not a difficult job and I will show you the easy method of building your fence.    Materials Needed:    Treatment preservative  Concrete  4x4 posts 8 feet in length.  2x4 for railing in either 8 or 16 feet in length  1x6 or 1x8 fence boards (your preference)  3 1/2"" galvanized nails  2 1/2"" flat head galvanized nails  Hardware for gate (hinges and latch)    Before you get started you must first figure out your  fence  line. This will help you calculate the materials needed to build your fence. When determining your fence line the best thing to do is talk to your neighbors. If you're in disagreement you can look for the property survey markers or if all else fails have your property surveyed. It's best to keep the entire fence on your property. Once you know the fence line mark it with a string line. Using stakes hammered into the ground run the line 2 feet past each end of the fence line. Secure the string tightly to the stakes.    Next you need to treat your posts by following the manufacturers recommendations. I would suggest treatment at least 8 inches above ground level. You can also purchase posts that are pre-treated from your lumber store if you wish.    Measure your post holes 8 feet apart. I wouldn't recommend any further apart as through time your fence may sag or lean. Dig the holes about 28 inches deep. Make sure all posts are of equal distance apart. It's now time to prepare your concrete for setting the posts. Mix your concrete with 1 part cement, 2 parts sand and 3 parts gravel. Add water and mix to a thick consistency but at the same time wet enough to pour all the way around the posts. Fill each hole 6 inches deep. Now it's time to place the posts in every hole. Use a level to make sure each post is plumb and barely touching the string. Finish filling each hole to about 2 inches below ground level. Double check each post making sure it's plumb.     After the posts have set it's time to add the railings. Make sure to set the bottom rail 8 inches above ground and be careful to have both ends the same height from the ground. Fasten the top rails by measuring from the bottom rail up to the desired position. Finally attach the middle rail central between the bottom and top rails.     Before you nail the boards to the railings you might want to consider staining or painting them first as it is easier than doing this after they've been fastened. If you decide to go this route you should also stain or paint the posts and rails prior to attaching the boards. Using a spacer to maintain equal gaps you can begin nailing the boards to the rails, using 2 of the 2 1/2 inch nails hammered on each rail. Use a level to make sure the boards are vertically plumb.    Now that your fence is up you probably want a gate. First you need to determine the size of the gate. I would recommend a gate no less than 3 feet wide. You should build a frame with the 2x4's overlapping and attach a middle rail for durability and strength. To allow room for the hinges and latch make sure the gate frame is built allowing 1 inch narrower between the gate posts. Next attach the fence boards and finally install the hinges and latch.    That's all there is to it. Now it's time to take a break and enjoy the beautiful fence you've just built.      ArticleSource:  ArticlesAlley.com            About the author     Jerry Holt is a writer for the website Do It Yourself Today.

My son-in-law and daughter said they     would be glad to install it for me....then I find out he has NO idea of how to do it (he     DOES know how to operate the post hole digger!).  So I took a chance that I might     find some help on ""the NET"".  I never imagined there was such a helpful     site out there!   The information I printed out would almost enable a blind person to     put a fence up.   This is great! Thank you so much!!!!!  I think we will be fine     now.  I thank you and my Rottweiler baby, Greta thanks you too.      ~Pauline Doudrick       *Thanks Pauline, Glad we could help!

Keep in mind some areas may require a specific distance     offset from the fence line.      Mark the center of holes with paint or a stake.      Posts are normally spaced 10' maximum.  If you want to put privacy slats in     chain link consider 8' spacing for     Dig holes 6"" diameter by 30 to 36"" deep (or     below frost line in your area). Don't make holes too shallow.  For larger diameter     posts dig the diameter of  the holes about 3 times the diameter of the post.      Restretch string and check holes for accuracy by     placing a post in the hole and plumbing in all directions.  If the hole needs     'shaved' or moved, do it now.  If holes are shallow because you hit an object you     can't remove,  'bell' the hole at the bottom.  That is to enlarge the bottom     bigger than the top diameter.  This will compensate for holes as shallow as 18""     deep.  If necessary move the hole to miss the obstruction.  This will change     your post spacing.  However, there is no harm in the case of line posts.  If you     must move it more than a couple of feet, consider installing an extra post midway on the     enlarged space.  Occasionally posts can be welded on plates and actually bolted to     rock, when they are shallower than 12-18"".      Mix concrete with water using pre-mixed bag.  Go     easy on the water.  Mix should look like thick gray mud, not like Mom's watered-down     chili.  If it doesn't pile up on the shovel, it's too thin; add more mix to dry it     up.  If you are mixing from scratch using aggregate like gravel, limestone or sea     shells, concrete sand and portland cement, mix 3 to 4 parts (shovels) of aggregate to 2     parts sand and 1 part cement.      Mark post grade mark.  End, corner and gate     posts should be marked at the height of the fence plus 1 inch;  49"" for a 4'     fence, 61"" for a 5' fence, etc.  Mark intermediate or line posts at height of     the fence minus 3 inches; 45"" for 4' fence, 57"" for 5' fence, etc.  When     you add your line post cap and top rail, the height will be proper.  These     measurements represent how much of the post is out of the ground.  In no case set the     posts below these marks (unless you are willing to dig to bury the fence).  You can     set them higher to allow for short span dips in the ground. Remember, if in doubt: It     is easy to cut a post off; it's not so easy to make it longer.      Have your helper (best friend or wife) hold the post     perfectly plumb in the hole.  Fill  the concrete carefully around the post to     3"" below the ground (my wife does the shoveling).  Adjust height of post to the     grade mark or higher.  Backfill dirt around the post level to the ground.  Step     on it to pack and plumb post as needed.  That's one down.  Repeat for all posts     in a particular line of fence from end post to end post.  Adjust heights of all posts     so they are as straight across the top as you view the entire line.  Do not push one     to low as described above.  Most lots are not graded perfectly level, just attempt to     make smooth transitions from one post to the next.  You don't want the top to rise     and fall from post to post, unless absolutely necessary.  Keep grade marks tight to     ground, if you want the fence to contain a dog.  If you want a space under the fence,     leave the post up higher intentionally.  In fact, if you desire 2 inch space under,     mark your grade marks 2 inch longer than described previously.      Install gate posts with the exact opening size as     recommended by gate supplier or manufacturer.  The opening size is the distance     between the two gate posts.  If possible make the tops of gate posts level to each     other by placing a post across the tops of the posts and checking with a level.  If     the ground slopes off sharply under the gate, set the gate posts to grade.  It won't     look proper to make them level.      Let concrete get hard for atleast a few days before     contin         Install Fittings                    Place tension bands on end and corner posts.      Put  'quantity = height minus one' tension bands     per hookup; minimum of three.      A  hookup  is each connection to an end or     corner post.      The tension bands are offset.  The offset goes     on the same side as the chain link fabric will be installed.  This is normally the     outside of the enclosed area.      Place one brace band per hookup over the tension     bands.  This fitting requires one rail end cup, one bolt and nut.      The rail end cup is offset also.  This offset     can be up or down on an end post.  On a corner, since two sets of brace bands and     rail end cups must share the same space, the bottom rail end cup is to be offset up and     the bottom rail end cup is to be offset down.  This enables the two cups to be level     to each other, so your top rail can be inserted into the cups and be level to each other.      Put all bolts in with theuts on the inside of the     enclosed area, opposite the chain link and tension band offset. That way someone outside     the finished fence can't remove the nuts.      Place caps on posts.  The ends and corners are     simple. They only go on one way (my wife puts those on).  The loop caps, as they are     called, are offset, if you look at them carefully.  The offset side faces the outside     of the enclosure; the same side as the chain link will be installed.      Do not put bolts in tension bands at this time.      Save gate hinges for later also.          Install Top Rail                Slide top rail through loop caps on line posts     starting at one end.      Some top rail has a 'swedged' end, which tapers down     so it will fit into another piece of rail.  Fit the non-swedged end into the rail end     cup at the end or corner post.      Add sections of rail, sliding each non-swedged end     into a swedged end.  Be certain to push rails toward your beginning point to 'seat'     them all the way into each other.  Push firmly. If the top rail has no swedged end     then you need a  'sleeve'  that acts as a coupling.      Add rail to next end or corner post      Cut excess rail off with hack saw or pipe cutter.      Mark the cut-off point carefully so the rail will fit snugly into the rail end cup,     by using the installed rail end cup, and marking the rail at the back of the cup.  It     is important to have a tight fit.  Any slack in your entire length of rail will allow     the chain link, when stretched tight, to pull the end posts in towards each other.      Install top rail in all stretches of fence.          Stretch Chain Link         Weaving The Chain Link Fabric           Starting at one end of a line of fence, roll chain     link out on the outside of the enclosed area or the side you previously have chosen.      Roll out another roll, if more is needed to reach the     next end post.  Chain link is stretched in one continuous length of woven chain link     from end post to end post.      'Weave'  chain link rolls together.  This     can be a little tricky, if never done before.  This requires some explanation.       Each weave is continuous from the top to     the bottom along the vertical or height of the roll.  If you follow the strand,     starting at the top, you will see that it zig-zags back and forth to the bottom.  It     starts and ends with either a 'knuckle' or a 'twisted'       To remove a weave, unbend the end of the weave     'knuckle' straight.  Unbend the adjacent weave that is knuckled to it.  If it     has a twisted end, simply untwist the two weaves until they can be separated.       Follow the weave to the other end as it     zig-zags back and forth and untwist or unknuckle the opposite end.  Be certain you     follow carefully, so you undo the proper weave.       At the top of the fence or the bottom, spin the     weave in a counter-clockwise direction, as if to unscrew it from the roll.  Most     newly manufactured chain link spins out counter-clockwise, whereas some chain link     manufactured years ago spins out clockwise.  Continue spinning and you will see the     other end unweaving from it's adjacent weaves.  If you are having difficulty, you may     have disconnected the wrong weaves at the opposite end,  you may have not bent the     other end straight enough and it keeps snagging as you try to spin it or the chain link is     stretched to tight along the ground; give yourself some slack.      The procedure for weaving to rolls together is just     the oppositeexcept it can be tricky getting started.      To start weaving : Chain link forms squares or     diamonds.  They are called diamonds. You must match two sections or rolls together     before you start weaving, in such a way that one roll has a full diamond and the other     roll has a half diamond, so when you add a weave, you will end up with a full diamond and     two ends to knuckle or twist together.      Spin the single weave into the first full diamond on     the full diamond roll.  Spin it through the next full diamond of the other roll.      Continue spinning and make certain that the weave end goes through each full diamond     on each roll in each revolution.      If you have trouble: Your chain link is too tight;     give some slack,  you missed a diamond somewhere or you may have mismatched rolls     that came from different manufacturer's or the rolls have different mesh sizes.      Count the number of full diamonds in each roll.  They should be the same.      Hopefully you have successfully woven the two rolls     together.  Twist or re-knuckle the ends together.  If you have no counter weave     to fasten to, you started with either two half diamonds on each roll or two full diamonds     on each roll.  Take it apart and try again.  Sometimes you have to flip the one     roll over (most have a half diamond at one end and a full diamond at the other) or remove     a weave from one roll to create a starting half or full diamond.               Stretching The Fabric          After rolling out the chain link and weaving the     rolls together, 'hookup' one end. Space the tension bands evenly as illustrated above     (figure F51). Make sure the nuts are on the inside of the fence so they can not be removed     from outside the enclosure.     If you have a sharp incline approaching a terminal     post, the fabric must be cut on the end. This is called a 'bias cut'. See  details  on how to make a bias cut     in chain link fabric.     Pull the chain link tight by hand to the other end.     You may stand the chain link and lean it against the posts or leave it on the ground and     lean it up as you stretch the fabric later. Generally the later is easier and better on     long stretches.      Hookup stretch tools as illustrated (figure F51).     Make sure the come-a-long hook faces away from the fabric or it will get caught in the     diamonds.      Tighten the come-a-long slowly. Check that the fabric     is not getting caught on posts, tree roots or other obstacles. If you haven't already done     so, lean the      ' Dress ' the fabric as you tighten it. ' Dressing '     involves straightening the fabric diamonds so they run true. Some spots will be higher     than others as you sight down the top. Lift the fabric in the low spots. This must be done     before the fabric gets too tight. Once it is tight, little can be done to straighten the     fabric. Some fabric dresses easily, some does not. If the fabric does not dress up     properly, you can always loosen the come-a-long and try again.      The fabric is tight enough when you can't squeeze the     diamonds together with one hand. Do not over stretch or post damage will occur. The top of     the fence should 'snap' back to the posts when pulled out a little.      Hand stretch the small section left at the     come-a-long. Cut the excess fabric off. Slide the tension bar into the mesh and make your     last hookup. Once all bolts are in place, remove the stretching tools.           Tie Off The Fabric         Install tie wires onto top rail first to establish     the height of the fence. Space tie wires no more bsp;than 2' apart.      Tie line posts last. Use the same number per post as     tension bands. This quantity is a minimum (1 per foot).      The fabric top diamond should be centered on the top     rail. It can be lowered or raised slightly if desired.     Click  HERE      for an animation of how to tie a tie wire.         Install Gates               Install female hinges on gates. Space them the     maximum distance apart as possible.      Hold gate in opening and mark the location of male     hinges. Point the hinge on the bottom up and the one on top down.      Install bottom hinge and tighten only until it is     just snug (you may have to move it). Once again, the nuts belong inside the fence     enclosure.      Install top hinge. Do not tighten.      Place gate on bottom hinge and lower top male hinge     into female hinge.      If the space under the gate is acceptable. Tighten     top male hinge just snug.      Test swing the gate to see if it will miss the     ground. Adjust as needed.      Tighten All hinge bolts. Do not over tighten. When     the bolts begin to bend....stop.      Install the latch (nuts inside).      In the case of a double swing gate, install the gate     closest to the ground first, unless the ground is perfectly level. Hang second gate level     to the first.      Install double gate drop rod/latch assembly.      Install center stop for double swing gate. Close the     double gate, making certain the two leaves are lined up (straight). Mark the ground where     the center stop needs to be installed by pushing the drop rod into the ground. Open the     gate and pound a piece of 1 5/8"" O.D. pipe flush to the ground. Proceed slowly,     checking the gate to make certain you are driving the pipe straight. There are special     fittings available to use for more sophisticated center stops. If  the center stop is     in a concrete drive, simply drill a hole in the concrete larger than the drop rod diameter     and do not use a pipe. Always make a much larger hole (or pipe size) than the diameter of     the drop rod to allow for gate sag, posts shifting, ice and other factors.       Good luck with your project!

These tips can save you time, money and effort. Read all suggestions carefully before beginning the job.                                SPACING THE FENCE POSTS           As a rule, you should set fence posts about 6' to 8' apart. The spacing of the posts         depends on the type of fence you build, the terrain, the purpose of the fence, and other         such factors.         Set the corner or end post first. Then stretch a line from each corner or end post to         align all the posts in between.         Drive a stake every 6' to 8' at the exact position where the post hole is to be dug         (Fig. 1).         Take time to measure and position the posts accurately. The appearance and the         structural strength of your fence depends a great deal on the positioning of the fence         posts.                                                                           SETTING THE FENCE POSTS           Set all wood fence posts with about 1/3 of their total length buried in the ground. This         is especially important on corner posts and any posts that will carry heavy weight or         withstand high wind pressure.         Use a regular post hole digger to dig the post holes. Dig the holes straight to the         proper depth at each stake marker.         You can anchor the posts more firmly by making the holes slightly larger at the bottom         than at the top (Fig. 2). Place a large stone or two shovels full of gravel in the bottom         of each hole. This provides drainage to avoid excessive moisture at the base of each post.         Use a wood preservative to treat the section of the post that will be underground. Allow         the post to stand overnight in the preservative so it can become well-saturated.         You can pack the posts with either dirt or concrete. In either case, place two or three         shovels full of gravel in the bottom of each hole before the post is placed into position.         Be sure the posts are in an exact, upright position (Fig. 3). You can check the         alignment of each post with a regular level. You can also check the alignment of the posts         in one direction by sighting from one end of the row of posts to the other.         Brace each post with stakes after it is properly aligned (Fig. 3). Keep the stakes in         position until the concrete (if used) has thoroughly set. Remove the nails holding the         braces and readjust the post until it is in accurate alignment.         When the post is properly aligned, tamp it thoroughly to pack the dirt (if used) around         the base of the post. Be sure you do not alter the alignment of the post during the         tamping process.         When the post is firmly in position, build a mound around it to help eliminate water         standing at the post base (Fig. 4). Slope the concrete slightly away from the post and         round it off with a trowel. Tamp the concrete lightly to eliminate any air bubbles left in         the mixture that can act as water pockets.         Provide extra bracing at all corners (Fig. 5). A corner post must carry the weight of         fence stretched in two directions, so it should be set in both directions.         Allow the posts to stand several days and settle firmly in position before adding the         fence.         The heads of posts should be rounded, capped or slanted to help eliminate accumulating         water, which can cause rotting. This is well-worth the effort since it allows the posts to         last.                                                                           ADDING RAILS TO FENCE POSTS           Attach a top and bottom rail to the fence posts (Fig. 7). There are three basic ways to         do this.         The center illustration shows the top rail being nailed to the top of the post. This is         an ideal installation for many types of fencing structures. The top rail can always be         joined to another rail in the center of a post this way.         If the rail is added on the body of the post rather than at the top, attach it with a         groove, a wood block or a metal bracket.         You can attach the bottom rail to the post by either of the two outside illustrations.         Fig. 8 illustrates several other ways to attach a rail to a fence post. Study these         illustrations carefully. The type of joint you use to attach the fence supports to the         post depends primarily on the type of fence you are building.         The lap joint is one of the easiest to use. The grooved joint does basically the same         job, but the rail is grooved into the post rather than being nailed to the post surface.         The butt joint is a little more difficult to make but is often better. The mortised         joint is even neater than the butt joint, but you must cut a mortise into the post for         this joint.         The slotted joint is commonly used on decorative fences. Treat all slotted joints with         preservative to prevent rotting in the grooved areas.         Take time to measure from the top rail to be sure the bottom rail on each is in perfect         alignment (Fig. 9). After you have measured one post, cut a measuring stick to prevent         having to make an actual measurement on each post. The stick can be used to apply the same         measurement to each post.                                                                                                   SELECTING THE FENCE STYLE           There are literally hundreds of variations in fence styles and construction materials.         There is pre-assembled wood fencing sections as well as fencing materials made from         recycled milk jugs. The type of fence you use depends primarily on the purpose.         Fences like the type shown in Fig. 10 are used primarily for barriers. They are easy to         build and provide an adequate barrier. However, they are usually not very decorative and         they provide very little, if any, privacy.         Fences like those illustrated in Fig. 11 provide barriers and are more attractive than         an ordinary fence. With a little shrubbery or plants, such fences can provide very         attractive barriers along property lines.         Fences such as those illustrated in Fig. 12 are primarily privacy screens. They can be         built as tall as needed out of many different materials. Their primary purpose is privacy.         Consider your needs when selecting the style of your fence. If you want a simple         barrier, a wire fence or a simple style fence such as illustrated in Fig. 10, will work         fine.         For a barrier that enhances the appearance, consider styles similar to those illustrated         in Fig. 11.         For added privacy, consider the styles illustrated in Fig. 12.         Regardless of the type of fence you plan to build, be sure you know exactly where your         property line is located. If you are uncertain about the location of the line, check into         it or work out an agreement on the fence location with your neighbor.         Also, check any local ordinances applying to fences before beginning construction. Call         the building department of your local city hall or ask for the local government office         that regulates construction to be sure you abide by city codes.         Try to keep the bottom rail of any fence at least 2"" above the ground. This helps         eliminate the problem of decay and makes it easier to trim grass around the base of the         fence.         Fig. 13 illustrates four basic styles of easy-to-build fence. Each style has the same         basic top, center and bottom rail construction. However, the fences look entirely         different with the various rail treatments.         Study the designs in Fig. 13 carefully. Decide which of these styles you prefer, or use         a little imagination and create your own fencing design to apply to the basic rail fencing         structure.         Picket fences are very popular and easy to build. With a little ingenuity you can create         attractive picket designs. Study the designs in Fig. 14. Use the designs shown in Fig. 14         or your own designs to create a distinctive picket fence.         Make sure that all the pickets are spaced by inserting a loose picket between the picket         previously nailed into position and the picket to be nailed. Use this easy method         throughout the entire fencing construction.         A basket weave fence is often used on a sloping terrain (Fig. 16). This style of fence         allows you to raise or lower each post.         Use a good-quality board to build a basket weave fence. Boards full of knots may break         easily when placed under the stress of basket weaving.         A simple board fence is easy to build and can be quite attractive (Fig. 17). You can         place the boards on one side or alternate them from side to side.         The board fence provides both a barrier and privacy. It can be built as tall as needed         and then stained, painted or left natural.         You can design a siding fence to match the siding on your home of this style. In fact,         you can use the same siding that was used on the home to build the fence.         The siding fence can be covered on one side or both. Then, you can paint it to match or         harmonize with the paint on your home.          These are only a few of the many styles of fencing available. Fences are easy to build,         and the materials are readily available.
