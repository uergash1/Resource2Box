Inaugurated in 1997, Yahoo! Mail serves over 260 million users. [ 2 ]  Currently, Yahoo! offers two versions of Yahoo! Mail: an  Outlook -like  Ajax  interface powered by Yahoo!'s  Zimbra  introduced in 2007, as well as the traditional static-web-page ""Yahoo! Mail Classic,"" which continues the availability of the simpler 1997-2006 interface for the brand's considerable installed base of users. In early 2008, Yahoo! started offering unlimited mail storage even to its non-paying users, in response to heated competition in the free-webmail market segment.

Mail began with  JoJo Healy ,  Yahoo! 's resident  investment banker  since November 1996, who has dealt with every Yahoo! acquisition since it was created. ""No one knows your business like your employees,"" he said. According to him, the main question was always to consider whether to ""build, buy or rent."" The answer really depended on the growth of competitors and the current position of the company. The main reason to buy things was to gain speed to market.   The growth in the number of  Internet  users eventually boosted the  e-mail  technology, but also created a very competitive environment where the winner was the first company to launch a successful e-mail service and attract potential users. E-mail became one of the most important features of a Web company as it would mean regular visits from e-mail users to the website.   When Hotmail and Mirabilis (the creator of the instant messenger  ICQ ) were looking to be bought, Yahoo! was the first company to which both made offers. Yahoo!, however, passed on both companies as they were too expensive for Yahoo! at that time. In the end, Microsoft ended up buying  Hotmail  for  $ 400 million and  AOL  bought  Mirabilis  for $288 million.   Later there was also to be another battle to acquire the online communications company  Four11 . Yahoo! made a deal with the company for co-branded white pages. Marvin Gavin, who worked at Four11 as director of international business development said, ""We always had a bias about being acquired by Yahoo! They were more entrepreneurial than Microsoft. We had a great cultural fit  it made a lot of sense."" The real point in acquiring Four11 was that in March 1997, the company had launched  Rocketmail , a webmail system that could be offered to users. In the end, Yahoo! concluded a deal with Four11 for $96 million. Yahoo! announced the acquisition [ 4 ]  on  October 8 ,  1997 , very close to the time that Yahoo! Mail was launched. [ 1 ]  Yahoo! Mail resulted from an acquisition rather than internal platform development because, as Healy said, ""Hotmail was growing at thousands and thousands users per week. We did an analysis. For us to build, it would have taken four to six months, and by then, so many users would have taken an e-mail account. The speed of the market was critical.""   The transition to Yahoo! Mail was not easy for many Rocketmail users at first. Yahoo! released various  help pages  to try and help these users. [ 5 ]  Soon after, on  March 21 ,  2002 , Yahoo! cut free software client access and introduced the $29.99 per year Mail Forwarding Service. [ 6 ]  Mary Osako, a Yahoo! Spokeswoman, told CNET, ""For-pay services on Yahoo!, originally launched in February 1999, have experienced great acceptance from our base of active registered users, and we expect this adoption to continue to grow.""   During the summer of 2002, the Yahoo! network was gradually redesigned. On  July 2 , Yahoo.com was redesigned and it was announced that other services like Yahoo! Mail would enter the same process. [ 7 ]  Along with this new design, new features were to be implemented, including new navigation tools, such as drop-down menus in  DHTML  and different category tabs, and a new user-customizable color scheme.   In November of the same year, Yahoo! launched another paid service:  Yahoo! Mail Plus . [ 8 ]  Yahoo! Mail Plus offered a number of new features, including:     25 megabytes of e-mail storage   10 megabyte message size limit   Ability to send up to 10 attachments per e-mail   POP Access and Forwarding   Archiving of e-mail messages to a hard drive for offline access   Ability to send messages from Yahoo! Mail using other e-mail domains   200 blocked addresses and 50 filters to help screen unsolicited e-mails   No promotional taglines in messages   No account expiration.         The launch of Yahoo! Mail Plus is part of Yahoo!'s strategic initiative to offer premium services that deliver innovative, reliable and relevant services to consumers"", said Geoff Ralston, senior vice president, Yahoo! Network Services, and creator of the original Yahoo! Mail technology in 1997. ""In just five years, Yahoo! Mail has grown from one million to tens of millions of users, illustrating how consumers have made e-mail an essential part of their daily lives. Through Yahoo! Mail Plus, Yahoo! continues to demonstrate leadership and innovation by offering consumers the industry's most complete and powerful e-mail solution.      [ 8 ]     On  April 1 ,  2004 , Google announced a free  webmail  with 1 gigabyte of storage. Though  Gmail , Google's e-mail service, offered a large amount of storage, its invitation-only accounts kept the other webmail services at the forefront. Most of the major webmail providers like Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, and AOL followed Google's lead and increased their mailbox storage considerably. Yahoo! was the first provider to announce 100 MB of storage for basic accounts and 2 GB of storage for premium users. [ 9 ]  Determined not to lose customers, Yahoo! Mail then countered Hotmail and Google by increasing the storage quota of its free email accounts to 1 GB, and eventually removing a storage limit altogether and allowing unlimited storage.   On  July 9 ,  2004 , Yahoo! acquired  Oddpost , a strong webmail offering that simulated a desktop email client like Microsoft Outlook. Oddpost had new innovative features such as drag-and-drop support, right-click menus, RSS feeds, and a preview pane, but it also had incredible speed, using e-mail caching to shorten response time, and many of these features were incorporated into an updated Yahoo! Mail service. [ 10 ]   On  August 30 ,  2007 , Walter Mossberg wrote in the  Wall Street Journal  that Yahoo! will be releasing the new version over the next few weeks. [1]     [ edit ]   New Yahoo! Mail          Y! Mail Final Version              Mail Beta and Messenger integration.              Calendar event in Mail              Mail RSS feed reader              Login screen       The New Yahoo! Mail has a revised interface which contains mostly  Ajax  ( JavaScript  and  XML ). It is very similar to a heavy mail client like Outlook (Drag and drop capabilities, Mail search, tabs). The new Yahoo! Mail comes with an integrated Messenger; as a result, users are able to chat with Yahoo! Messenger and Windows Live Messenger contacts while reading their email.   As of  August 26 ,  2007 , the new Yahoo! Mail came out of Beta period. The development of what has now become the new interface, started since July 2004, although it is possible other prototypes were in development before then. It is currently compatible with  Internet Explorer 7 ,  Firefox  and  Safari  as well as  Camino  and other  Gecko  based browsers. (As part of Yahoo!'s plan to eventually upgrade all of their sites to be compatible with Firefox [ 11 ] ). Although it is usable under  Opera , there are slight visual problems regarding the layout.   In September 2005 Yahoo! began beta testing a significantly enhanced version of their e-mail service, based on  Ajax  scripting acquired from  Oddpost , along with new philosophical approaches to email, including the Oddpost design philosophy (which Google made heavy use of in Gmail):   Given that the All-New Yahoo! Mail is based on Oddpost, it features the same underlying code base, including the implementation of this design concept to minimize the amount of data sent during an email session by creating a JavaScript UI engine on the client side and sending ""Datapacks"" instead of reloading the whole interface on every click like a traditional webmail service [2]  (e.g. traditional Yahoo! Mail). This makes the service much faster than its counterparts.   However, unlike Oddpost, All-New Yahoo! Mail runs on a variety of OS's and browsers, and runs perfectly under  Internet Explorer 7  and  Firefox . On February 13, 2008, Yahoo! announced on the  Yahoo! Mail blog  that it would begin supporting version 3 of the Mac OS X default browser  Safari , as well as the Mac versions of  Firefox .   The  look and feel  of the new version is designed to mimic a  desktop   e-mail client , and it offers unlimited storage space, tabbed emails,  RSS  feeds, drag-and-drop capabilities, advanced keyboard shortcuts, advanced search, integration with Yahoo!  Calendar  and  Messenger ,  Domain Keys , address auto-complete and more.   The All-New Yahoo! Mail also has a mascot called Liam, who is basically a little boy, who is shown in the ""Help"" panel as well as in the loading screen. Liam is ""mail"" spelled backward.     [ edit ]   Introduction   Wide-scale beta release of the new version was introduced in late 2006. In November 2006, the Mail Beta team announced plans of integrating  Yahoo! Messenger  functionality with the Mail Beta interface.  [ 12 ]  This service was deployed in March, 2007.   Public and critical reaction to the new product has been positive, [ 13 ]  although a number of users have encountered speed issues, which can render the client very difficult to use, especially on older hardware. Each update to the Beta has included significant speed improvements, and the Mail Beta team is still focused on improving speed issues. For example, the earlier versions of Mail Beta featured a loading screen every time you access mail. However, with various updates Mail Beta now appears immediately (no loading screen).   On  August 26 ,  2007 , Yahoo! Mail left beta and now the two versions which exist are known as Yahoo! Mail (the default interface) and Yahoo! Mail Classic (an updated version of the current interface). The announcement was made on the  Yahoo! Mail blog  by John Kremer, Vice President, Yahoo! Mail and the major improvements relate to intelligent shortcuts,  SMS  Messaging, and improved search.   The final version was released on October 9, 2007.     [ edit ]   Features   Some of the new or improved features included in the New Yahoo! Mail are:     Yahoo! Calendar integration   Yahoo! Messenger integration   Windows Live Messenger integration   SMS Messaging in certain countries   Keyboard shortcuts   Unlimited storage   Improved search facilities     In addition, an  Easter egg  was added called a  Subject-O-Matique . This hidden feature displays a random message in the subject line when the subject button is clicked. The messages range from cultural references (""I AM the  walrus "") to sarcastic (""If you don't tell lies, at least you don't have to remember what you have said."") to unusual and outlandish (""the art of driving a giant, nuclear powered duck"").   On December 15, 2008, Yahoo! Mail introduces features to make it more social. [ 14 ] [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Open source   In late 2006, Yahoo launched an API for Yahoo! Mail Plus. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Yahoo! Mail Classic          Screenshot of the 'Classic' version of Yahoo! Mail.       Mail Classic  is, since the launch of the new Yahoo! Mail, an optional secondary User Interface for Yahoo! Mail. Although the AJAX interface is the default one, Classic is available for users who are unable to, or prefer to use the legacy style interface.     [ edit ]   Features   Starting in May 2007, Yahoo! started to roll out to its users an ""unlimited"" amount of email storage. [ 17 ]   Yahoo! Mail has the following features:     [ edit ]   Free version     Unlimited Mail Storage.   10 MB attachments (20 MB for the Plus version)   Protection against spam and viruses. ( See:  DomainKeys )   Advertising is displayed on the screen while working with the e-mail account.   POP3 support, Mail Forwarding facility, and  SMTP  support in some countries (but not in the US).   Accounts not logged into for four months get deactivated (The account can be retrieved but all stored data such as email is lost).   Early in 2006, Yahoo! Mail introduced aliases to its repertoire of features. Users could now add a (single) alias username containing a dot character for a pre-existing account.   The Chinese version of Yahoo! Mail  offers 3.5 GB quota and 20 MB attachments.  [3]   Some users get features added if they are long time users.   Latest beta of Yahoo! Zimbra desktop allows for all Yahoo! users to use the software     Users can get around the  Web browser  access restriction by using software that simulates a POP3 server to which the e-mail application connects.  YPOPs!  and  FreePOPs  are examples of  free software  applications that allow  e-mail clients  access to webmail (including Yahoo! Mail) services through POP3.     [ edit ]   Business   Yahoo! Business E-mail is a combination of all their e-mail services with 10 distinct accounts each with the same features of the  plus version  and personalized domain name and e-mail address. Accounts can be managed by an administrator. There is $25 set-up fee and $9.99 monthly fee to use this service. Unfortunately yahoo is apparently still working out how to allow their business mail clients to access their email accounts from certain mobile smart phones and pdas. According to yahoo's website, for now, you can access your Business Email only from a BlackBerry. Yahoo says it plans to make business email compatible with more devices in the future.     Unlimited Mail Storage   10 E-mail quota.   Additionally, a user can pay $35 per year to have up to five custom e-mail addresses and a  domain name .   Yahoo! mail underlines addresses and phone numbers in email and allows the user to add them to the address book.       [ edit ]   Ymail and Rocketmail   Yahoo! Mail Vice President  John Kremer  on  June 19 , 2008 announced the tripling of the size of its free  online e-mail  service with the launching of 2 domains as options for its 266 million users of ""@yahoo.com"" addresses: the new, simpler e-mail addresses ending in ymail.com and rocketmail.com. Rocketmail has a ""hip retro feel"" since it is a resurrected email address of a 1997 Yahoo service. [ 18 ]  E-mail under the ymail and rocketmail will offer all the same features as the Yahoo domain, with an unlimited amount of storage capacity, with ability to instant message from within their e-mail inbox and spam and virus protection. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Spam policy   Like most free Webmail providers, Yahoo! Mail is often used by  spammers  to provide a ""remove me"" email address. More often than not, these addresses are used for the express purpose of verifying the recipient's address--thus opening the door for more spam. However, Yahoo! does not tolerate this practice. It terminates accounts connected with spam-related activities without warning, and spammers lose access to any other Yahoo! services connected with their ID. [4] [5]   In February 2006, Yahoo! also announced their decision (along with AOL) to give some organizations the option to ""certify"" mail, by paying up to one cent for each outgoing message, allowing the mail in question to bypass Yahoo's and AOL's inbound spam filters.  [6]     [ edit ]   Filters   In 2002, in order to prevent abuse, Yahoo! Mail had filters that changed certain words (that could trigger unwanted  Javascript  events) and word fragments into other words. "" Mocha "" was changed to "" espresso "", ""expression"" became ""statement"", and perhaps most damaging, ""eval"" (short for ""evaluation"") became ""review"". The widespread unintended effects of this can be seen by using search engines to find such  nonsensical  terms as ""prreviewent""(prevalent), ""reviewuation""(evaluation) and "" medireview ""(medieval).   When asked about these changes, Yahoo! explained that the changed words were common terms used in  Web scripting , and were blacklisted to prevent  hackers  from sending damaging commands via the program's  HTML  function.   As of  February 7 ,  2006 , the Yahoo! Mail filters no longer substitute certain words for others. Although the change may have occurred prior to this date, Yahoo! Mail now prefixes an ""_"" ( underscore ) to certain suspicious words and word fragments.   Sending a test email from a non-Yahoo! Mail account to a Yahoo! Mail account with the words ""Mocha"", ""eval"", ""Javascript"", and ""expression"" in a sentence resulted in the Yahoo! Mail filters prefixing an ""_"" (underscore) to those words, resulting in ""_Mocha"", ""_eval"", ""_Javascript"" and ""_expression"". This prefixing removes the threat of the words acting as commands via the program's HTML function by rendering them as non-commands or unrecognizable commands. As of  June 9 ,  2006 , only the terms ""expression"" and ""javascript"" were prefixed with an underscore (""_"").   There is also offered a spam filter called SpamGuard and an ability to set up custom filters. One problem that can be encountered is that the spam filter is applied before any custom filters you create. This results in some emails which you may wish to have directed to your Inbox or some other folder to be sent to your Bulk folder instead.     [ edit ]   Greylisting   Incoming mail to Yahoo! addresses can be subjected to  deferred  delivery as part of Yahoo!'s incoming  spam  controls. This can delay delivery of mail sent to Yahoo! addresses without the sender or recipients being aware of it. The deferral is typically of short duration, but may extend to several hours. Yahoo! does not specifically document this policy in detail, although some information is available. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Controversy     [ edit ]   Interference with  Gmail  Conversations   Messages replied or forwarded from local Yahoo! Mail accounts split up conversations in Gmail, because their subjects contain parameters in the local language, instead of ""Re"" or ""Fwd:"".     [ edit ]   User name bans   On  February 20 ,  2006 , it was revealed that Yahoo! Mail was banning the word "" Allah "" in e-mail user names, both separate and as part of a user name such as  linda.callahan . [ 23 ]  Shortly after the news of the ""Allah"" ban became widespread in media, it was lifted on  February 23 ,  2006 . Along with this action, Yahoo! also made the following statement: [ 24 ]       We continuously evaluate abuse patterns in registration usernames to help prevent spam, fraud and other inappropriate behavior. A small number of people registered for IDs using specific terms with the sole purpose of promoting hate, and then used those IDs to post content that was harmful or threatening to others, thus violating Yahoo!'s Terms of Service.   'Allah' was one word being used for these purposes, with instances tied to defamatory language. We took steps to help protect our users by prohibiting use of the term in Yahoo! usernames. We recently re-evaluated the term 'Allah' and users can now register for IDs with this word because it is no longer a significant target for abuse. We regularly evaluate this type of activity and will continue to make adjustments to our registration process to help foster a positive customer experience.         [ edit ]   Search function failure   Since the beginning of 2008, many users have experienced a failure of the search function in which it either fails to retrieve any messages, or (occasionally) just a small subset. Despite Yahoo being informed of this by many users for many months [ citation needed ] , they have failed to fix it.

Search          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Yahoo search )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the Yahoo! Search Engine.  For the corporation, see  Yahoo! . For other uses, see  Yahoo! (disambiguation) .     Yahoo! Search             Yahoo! Search       URL   search.yahoo.com       Type of site   Search Engine       Available  language (s)   Multilingual       Owner   Yahoo!       Created by   Yahoo!       Yahoo! Search  is a  web search engine , owned by  Yahoo!, Inc.  and is currently the second largest search engine on the web, after its competitor Google.  [ 1 ]   Originally  Yahoo! Search  started as a web directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In the late 1990s,  Yahoo!  evolved into a full-fledged portal with a search interface and, by 2007, a limited version of  selection-based search .   Yahoo! Search, originally referred to as  Yahoo! provided Search interface , would send queries to a searchable index of pages supplemented with its directory of sites. The results were presented to the user under the Yahoo! brand. Originally, none of the actual web crawling and storage/retrieval of data was done by Yahoo! itself. In 2001 the searchable index was powered by  Inktomi  and later was powered by  Google  until 2004, when Yahoo! Search became independent. Yahoo! Search major competitors are:  Google Search ,  Live Search  and  Ask Search .           Contents       1   Search technology acquisition   2   Yahoo!

In  2002 , they bought  Inktomi , a ""behind the scenes"" or OEM search engine provider, whose results are shown on other companies' websites and powered Yahoo! in its earlier days. In 2003, they purchased  Overture Services, Inc. , which owned the  AlltheWeb  and  AltaVista  search engines. Initially, even though Yahoo! owned multiple search engines, they didn't use them on the main yahoo.com website, but kept using  Google's search engine  for its results.   Starting in  2003 , Yahoo! Search became its own  web crawler -based search engine, with a reinvented crawler called  Yahoo! Slurp . Yahoo! Search combined the capabilities of all the search engine companies they had acquired, with its existing research, and put them into a single search engine. The new search engine results were included in all of Yahoo!'s sites that had a web search function. Yahoo! also started to sell the search engine results to other companies, to show on their own web sites. Their relationship with Google was terminated at that time, with the former partners becoming each other's main competitors.   In  October 2007 , Yahoo! Search was updated with a more modern appearance in line with the redesigned Yahoo! home page. In addition,  Search Assist  was added; which provides real-time query suggestions and related concepts as they are typed.   In  July 2008 , Yahoo! Search announced the introduction of a new service called ""Build Your Own Search Service,"" or BOSS. This service opens the doors for developers to use Yahoo!'s system for indexing information and images and create their own custom search engine. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Yahoo! Search blog & announcements   The team at Yahoo! Search frequently blogs about search announcements, features, updates and enhancements. The Yahoo! Search Blog, as stated provides  A look inside the world of search from the people at Yahoo!. [ 3 ]  This includes index updates named  Weather Updates  and their  Yahoo! Search Assist  feature.     [ edit ]   International presence   Yahoo! Search also provides their search interface in at least 38 international markets and a variety of available languages. [ 4 ]  Yahoo! has a presence in Europe, Asia and across the Emerging Markets.     [ edit ]   Search results   Yahoo! Search indexes and caches the common HTML page formats, as well as several of the more popular file-types, such as  PDF ,  Excel spreadsheets ,  PowerPoint ,  Word documents , RSS/XML and plain text files. For some of these supported file-types, Yahoo! Search provides  cached  links on their search results allowing for viewing of these file-types in standard HTML.   Using the Advanced Search interface or Preferences settings, Yahoo! Search allows the customization of search results and enabling of certain settings such as: SafeSearch, Language Selection, Number of results, Domain restrictions, etc. [ 5 ]   For a Basic and starter guide to Yahoo! Search, they also provide a  Search Basics  tutorial. [ 6 ]   In the first week of May 2008, Yahoo! launched a new search mash up called  Yahoo! Glue , which is in beta testing. Currently it is only available on the Yahoo! India Search Page.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Selection-based search   On  June 20 ,  2007 , Yahoo! introduced a  selection-based search  feature called Yahoo! Shortcuts. When activated this selection-based search feature enables users to invoke search using only their mouse and receive search suggestions in floating windows while remaining on Yahoo! properties such as Yahoo! Mail. This feature is only active on Yahoo web pages or pages within the  Yahoo! Publisher Network . Yahoo! Shortcuts requires the content-owner to modify the underlying HTML of his or her webpage to call out the specific keywords to be enhanced. The technology for context-aware selection-based search on Yahoo pages was first developed by Reiner Kraft. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   SearchScan          SearchScan in action.       On  May 11 ,  2008 , Yahoo! introduced SearchScan. If enabled this  add-on /feature will enhance Yahoo! Search by automatically alerting users of  viruses ,  spyware  and  spammy  websites. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Search verticals   Yahoo! Search provides the ability to search across numerous vertical properties outside just the Web at large. These include Images, Videos, Local, Shopping, Yahoo! Answers, Audio, Directory, Jobs, News, Mobile, Travel and various other services as listed on their  About Yahoo! Search  page.

clueweb09-enwp02-05-01050	"                     Yahoo! Search          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the Yahoo! Search Engine.  For the corporation, see  Yahoo! . For other uses, see  Yahoo! (disambiguation) .     Yahoo! Search             Yahoo! Search       URL   search.yahoo.com       Type of site   Search Engine       Available  language (s)   Multilingual       Owner   Yahoo!       Created by   Yahoo!       Yahoo! Search  is a  web search engine , owned by  Yahoo!, Inc.  and is currently the second largest search engine on the web, after its competitor Google.  [ 1 ]   Originally  Yahoo! Search  started as a web directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In the late 1990s,  Yahoo!  evolved into a full-fledged portal with a search interface and, by 2007, a limited version of  selection-based search .   Yahoo! Search, originally referred to as  Yahoo! provided Search interface , would send queries to a searchable index of pages supplemented with its directory of sites. The results were presented to the user under the Yahoo! brand. Originally, none of the actual web crawling and storage/retrieval of data was done by Yahoo! itself. In 2001 the searchable index was powered by  Inktomi  and later was powered by  Google  until 2004, when Yahoo! Search became independent. Yahoo! Search major competitors are:  Google Search ,  Live Search  and  Ask Search .           Contents       1   Search technology acquisition   2   Yahoo!

In  2002 , they bought  Inktomi , a ""behind the scenes"" or OEM search engine provider, whose results are shown on other companies' websites and powered Yahoo! in its earlier days. In 2003, they purchased  Overture Services, Inc. , which owned the  AlltheWeb  and  AltaVista  search engines. Initially, even though Yahoo! owned multiple search engines, they didn't use them on the main yahoo.com website, but kept using  Google's search engine  for its results.   Starting in  2003 , Yahoo! Search became its own  web crawler -based search engine, with a reinvented crawler called  Yahoo! Slurp . Yahoo! Search combined the capabilities of all the search engine companies they had acquired, with its existing research, and put them into a single search engine. The new search engine results were included in all of Yahoo!'s sites that had a web search function. Yahoo! also started to sell the search engine results to other companies, to show on their own web sites. Their relationship with Google was terminated at that time, with the former partners becoming each other's main competitors.   In  October 2007 , Yahoo! Search was updated with a more modern appearance in line with the redesigned Yahoo! home page. In addition,  Search Assist  was added; which provides real-time query suggestions and related concepts as they are typed.   In  July 2008 , Yahoo! Search announced the introduction of a new service called ""Build Your Own Search Service,"" or BOSS. This service opens the doors for developers to use Yahoo!'s system for indexing information and images and create their own custom search engine. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Yahoo! Search blog & announcements   The team at Yahoo! Search frequently blogs about search announcements, features, updates and enhancements. The Yahoo! Search Blog, as stated provides  A look inside the world of search from the people at Yahoo!. [ 3 ]  This includes index updates named  Weather Updates  and their  Yahoo! Search Assist  feature.     [ edit ]   International presence   Yahoo! Search also provides their search interface in at least 38 international markets and a variety of available languages. [ 4 ]  Yahoo! has a presence in Europe, Asia and across the Emerging Markets.     [ edit ]   Search results   Yahoo! Search indexes and caches the common HTML page formats, as well as several of the more popular file-types, such as  PDF ,  Excel spreadsheets ,  PowerPoint ,  Word documents , RSS/XML and plain text files. For some of these supported file-types, Yahoo! Search provides  cached  links on their search results allowing for viewing of these file-types in standard HTML.   Using the Advanced Search interface or Preferences settings, Yahoo! Search allows the customization of search results and enabling of certain settings such as: SafeSearch, Language Selection, Number of results, Domain restrictions, etc. [ 5 ]   For a Basic and starter guide to Yahoo! Search, they also provide a  Search Basics  tutorial. [ 6 ]   In the first week of May 2008, Yahoo! launched a new search mash up called  Yahoo! Glue , which is in beta testing. Currently it is only available on the Yahoo! India Search Page.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Selection-based search   On  June 20 ,  2007 , Yahoo! introduced a  selection-based search  feature called Yahoo! Shortcuts. When activated this selection-based search feature enables users to invoke search using only their mouse and receive search suggestions in floating windows while remaining on Yahoo! properties such as Yahoo! Mail. This feature is only active on Yahoo web pages or pages within the  Yahoo! Publisher Network . Yahoo! Shortcuts requires the content-owner to modify the underlying HTML of his or her webpage to call out the specific keywords to be enhanced. The technology for context-aware selection-based search on Yahoo pages was first developed by Reiner Kraft. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   SearchScan          SearchScan in action.       On  May 11 ,  2008 , Yahoo! introduced SearchScan. If enabled this  add-on /feature will enhance Yahoo! Search by automatically alerting users of  viruses ,  spyware  and  spammy  websites. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Search verticals   Yahoo! Search provides the ability to search across numerous vertical properties outside just the Web at large. These include Images, Videos, Local, Shopping, Yahoo! Answers, Audio, Directory, Jobs, News, Mobile, Travel and various other services as listed on their  About Yahoo! Search  page.

Launched   February 26 ,  2008       Yahoo! Buzz  is a community-based news article website, much like  Digg , that combines the features of  social bookmarking  and  syndication  through a user interface that allows editorial control. Users can be allowed to publish their own news stories, and link to their own or another person's site that links to a full story of the information, therefore driving traffic to that person's website and creating a larger market for sites that research and publish their own news articles and stories, such as  CNN  or smaller, privately owned websites.   Yahoo!  created the service in hopes that it would drive larger traffic to their site and would give them an advantage over larger online media companies such as  Google  or  MSN , which are Yahoo!'s largest competitors in terms of  search engines  that provide services and web features to its customers. Unlike other social networking sites, Buzz allows the publisher to modify the submission. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   See also     Yahoo!
