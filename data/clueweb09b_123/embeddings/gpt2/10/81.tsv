Although there are a number of different types of credentials for paralegals, and, therefore, variations in the lengths and types of coursework which one must successfully complete in order to receive his or her credentials, they all have the common purpose of educating the individual to take on an important role in the legal field.  This education gaining the knowledge necessary to do the job, and the skills necessary in order to be able to put it into practical use.  Both aspects of one's education are equally important.      Basic paralegal training generally consists of an overview of the legal system as a whole, specialized areas of practice, and the skills which are applicable to this line of work.  Don't make the mistake of letting this brief description give you the idea that there is anything vague or minimal about paralegal training, however, because the coursework is very complete, and quite intense.  It is also one of the most interesting and enjoyable types of coursework that you can possibly put your time into studying!    After you have completed basic paralegal coursework, you will have learned nearly everything that there is to know about the American courts and justice system.  This includes the history of this system, how it evolved into the way it is today, and details surrounding how the courts and justice system operates both in terms of the laws and the roles of legal representation.  You will also learn the fascinating details about codes, procedure, both the criminal and civil arenas, and how all of these things are applicable to the workings of the courts and justice system as a whole.      During your paralegal training you will also become very well acquainted with specialized areas of law.  Business, family, corporate, tax, family, and other specialties are covered in detail.  Not only will you learn what these areas are about, but you will also be taught everything you will need to do on an everyday basis if you elect to work in any of these areas.  You will not simply learn about the area you may wish to enter, you will be equally prepared for them all.    As working in the paralegal field requires one to be more than competent in a number of essential skills, you will enhance the skills you do have and prepare yourself with the others.  Working with computer programs, math, written and verbal communication skills, are all basic parts of a paralegal's everyday work life.  You will need to know how to conduct interviews, use spreadsheets, operate data bases, and other essentials;  all of these skills and many more will be addressed in your coursework.    Whichever method you choose to begin your studies, whichever specific type of credentials you wish to work toward, the period of time it will take for you to earn your credentials, or the individual school that you elect to study from, you can be completely assured that after you have successfully completed your training you will be well-informed and well-prepared to begin your exciting new career as a paralegal!                                                                                                                                                          Social bookmarking     Use our one click automatic submission service to bookmark this page     with your favorite social bookmarking services!

clueweb09-enwp00-65-13006	"                     Fair Credit Reporting Act          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  FCRA )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  Fair Credit Reporting Act  (FCRA) is an  American  federal  law  (codified at  15 U.S.C.    1681  et seq.) that regulates the collection, dissemination, and use of consumer credit information. ( Full Statute  (PDF).)] Along with the  Fair Debt Collection Practices Act  (FDCPA), it forms the base of consumer credit rights in the United States. It was originally passed in 1970, [ 1 ]  and is enforced by the US  Federal Trade Commission .           Contents       1   Consumer reporting agencies   2   Information furnishers   3   Users of the information for credit, insurance, or employment purposes   4   Likelihood of errors on a credit report   5   Civil liability for willful or negligent violations of the FCRA   6   Which companies are regulated by the FCRA?   7   See also   8   External links   9   References               [ edit ]   Consumer reporting agencies   Consumer reporting agencies  (CRAs) are entities that collect and disseminate information about consumers to be used for credit evaluation and certain other purposes. Credit bureaus, a type of consumer reporting agency, hold a consumer's  credit report  in their databases. CRAs have a number of responsibilities under FCRA, including the following:     Provide a consumer with information about him or her in the agency's files and to take steps to verify the accuracy of information disputed by a consumer. Under the  Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act  (FACTA), an amendment to the FCRA passed in 2003, consumers are able to receive one free credit report a year. [ 2 ]  The free report can be requested by telephone, mail, or through the government-authorized website,  annualcreditreport.com . [ 3 ]   If negative information is removed as a result of a consumer's dispute, it may not be reinserted without notifying the consumer within five days, in writing.   CRAs may not retain negative information for an excessive period. The FCRA describes how long negative information, such as late payments,  bankruptcies ,  tax liens  or  judgments  may stay on a consumer's credit report  typically seven years from the date of the delinquency. The exceptions:  bankruptcies  (10 years) and  tax liens  (seven years from the time they are paid).     The three big CRAs   Experian ,  TransUnion , and  Equifax   do not interact with information furnishers directly as a result of consumer disputes. They use a system called  E-Oscar . In some areas of the country, however, there are other credit bureaus. For example, in Texas, if a consumer tries to dispute information with Equifax directly, they must go through CSC Credit Services which is linked to the Equifax database.     [ edit ]   Information furnishers   An information furnisher, as defined by the FCRA, is a company that provides information to consumer reporting agencies. Typically, these are  creditors , with which a consumer has some sort of credit agreement ( credit card  companies,  auto  finance companies and  mortgage banking  institutions, to name a few). However, other examples of information furnishers are collection agencies (third-party collectors), state or municipal  courts  reporting a  judgment  of some kind, past and present employers and bonders. Under the FCRA, these information furnishers may only report to a consumer's credit report under the following guidelines:     They must provide complete and accurate information to the  credit reporting agencies .   The duty to  investigate  disputed information from consumers falls on them, and they must correct an error, or explain why the credit report is correct within 90 days of receipt of notice of a dispute.   They must inform consumers about negative information which has been or is about to be placed on a consumer's credit report within 30 days.     (This notice doesn't have to be sent as a separate notice, but may be placed on a consumer's monthly statement. If sent as part as the monthly statement, it needs to be conspicuous, but need not be in bold type. Required wording (developed by the US Federal Treasury Department):   Notice before negative information is reported :  We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.   Notice after negative information is reported :  We have told a credit bureau about a late payment, missed payment or other default on your account. This information may be reflected in your credit report. )     [ edit ]   Users of the information for credit, insurance, or employment purposes   Users of the information for  credit ,  insurance , or employment purposes (including  background checks ) have the following responsibilities under the FCRA:     They must notify the consumer when an adverse action is taken on the basis of such reports.   Users must identify the company that provided the report, so that the accuracy and completeness of the report may be verified or contested by the consumer.       [ edit ]   Likelihood of errors on a credit report   Some fraction of consumer credit reports contain errors. A study released by the U.S.  Public Interest Research Group  in June 2004 found that 79% of the consumer credit reports surveyed contained some kind of error or mistake. [ 4 ]  However, the General Accountability Office released a study disputing US PIRG numbers. [ 5 ]  In 2007, the Consumer Data Industry Association which represents the credit bureaus testified that less than two percent of 52 million credit reports had data deleted because it was in error.  [ 6 ]  Many consumers frequently invoke their rights under the FCRA to review and correct their credit reports.   The  Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act  (""FACTA"") of 2003 has allowed easier access to consumers wishing to view their reports and dispute items.     [ edit ]   Civil liability for willful or negligent violations of the FCRA   Under  616 of the Act, ( 15 U.S.C.    1681n ), a consumer may recover either actual damages or a minimum of $100 and a maximum of $1000 plus punitive damages and reasonable attorney's fees and costs for willful noncompliance with the Act. Under  617 of the Act, ( 15 U.S.C.    1681o ), recovery for a negligent violation is of actual damages, plus attorney's fees. Under  618, a consumer may file suit in state or federal court to enforce the Act, and the statute of limitations is the earlier of 2 years from discovery and 5 years from the violation. ( 15 U.S.C.    1681p .)     [ edit ]   Which companies are regulated by the FCRA?   While putative database companies like  Lexis ,  Westlaw ,  ChoicePoint , and  eFunds  (owner of  ChexSystems ) do  not  create credit reports, they may gather the same types of information and as a result may subject some of their actions to FCRA.   An excerpt of the  1999 FTC advisory opinion  states:     An entity that meets the definitional requirement for a ""consumer reporting agency"" (CRA) in Section 603(f) of the FCRA is covered by the law even if the only information it collects, maintains, and disseminates is obtained from ""public record"" sources.       Section 603(f) defines a ""consumer reporting agency"" as any person ""which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information ... for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties ..."". In turn, Section 603(d) defines a ""consumer report"" as the communication of ""any information"" by a CRA that bears on a consumer's ""credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living"" that is ""used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part"" for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing eligibility for credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, employment purposes, or any other purpose authorized under Section 604.       If the commercial service you describe regularly provides information for the purposes set forth in the definition of consumer report in Section 603(d), the agency is a consumer reporting agency and the information it collects from public record sources and maintains in its computerized files is subject to the FCRA.

Stan Herring P.C. assist clients in correcting their credit report, going through the dispute process, and with claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).    For information about our services and our commitment to our clients, please visit our  Firm Overview  page.    The Fair Credit Reporting Act    The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) was enacted to regulate the collection, dissemination, and use of consumer credit information, as well as outline the dispute process. According to a Consumer Reports article, approximately 70% of the credit reports contain errors.    Because errors in a credit report can severely impact your credit score and your ability to obtain credit, get an auto or home loan, and, in some cases, insurance or your employability, you need to take the appropriate steps to correct any credit report errors. These steps include notifying the credit reporting agency (Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union) of the discrepancy and proof that the report is wrong.    ""In 1970, Congress created the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a law which gives consumers specific rights in dealing with Consumer Reporting Agencies. The Fair Credit Reporting Act protects you by requiring that Consumer Reporting Agencies furnish correct and complete information to businesses for use in evaluating your application for credit, insurance, or a job.""   Consumer Guide to Credit Reporting.    In many cases, there are errors in credit reports for consumers who have successfully completed their bankruptcy. Please visit our  Incorrect Credit Reporting after Bankruptcy  page for more information on this subject.

Causes of Credit Report Errors    There can be many causes of credit reporting errors.

Fair Credit Reporting Act Claims    Before you can file a claim for inaccurate information on your credit report, you must inform the agency or agencies of the error and send proof of the error in the form of a dispute letter. We can assist you in drafting a dispute letter or you can do it yourself. You must send the letter certified mail so you have a record of the letter being mailed.

We help people who have been victimized by identity theft with their credit issues. We are not credit repair attorneys, but we can help you with your credit issues.

Under the  law, individuals, businesses and governments may not violate a persons civil  rights. If they do so anyway, that person has the right to sue the entity that  violated his or her rights to correct the wrong, and for any financial damages  that result. Civil rights lawyers help victims of civil rights violations file  and pursue these lawsuits.   Civil rights law in the United States is most often  associated with laws protecting certain groups of people from discrimination. However,  everyone -- regardless of race, gender, income or other factors -- has civil  rights.                                                                                    WHAT CIVIL RIGHTS ARE IN THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION?                     The U.S. Constitution outlines civil rights that the  government may not interfere with. The Bill of Rights, which are the first ten amendments  to the Constitution, outlines these basic rights, among others:                         Free       speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and freedom of assembly       and association.                       Keep       and use firearms.                       Be       free of unauthorized or unreasonable searches and seizure of property.                       Not be       forced to testify against yourself, not be tried twice for the same crime,       and to have fair compensation if the government takes your property.                       Have a       speedy and public trial by jury if accused of a crime, and be read your       Miranda rights at arrest.                        Have a       trial by jury when sued.                       Be       free of cruel and unusual punishment, and have bail available.                                                               Later Constitutional amendments added the civil rights to:                                           Be       free of enslavement.                       Be       considered a citizen if born in the United States, and be free of       interference in your civil rights by the states.                       Have       the right to vote regardless of color, race or previous status as a slave.                       Have       the right to vote regardless of sex.                       Have       the right to vote regardless of whether you paid a poll tax.                       Have       the right to vote if you are at least 18 years old.                                         There are also implied rights that come from judges interpretation  of the Constitution, such as the right to privacy found in the 1965 Supreme  Court decision in  Griswold v. Connecticut .  Many rights have been provided by courts in this matter.                                                             WHAT ARE SOME OTHER MAJOR FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS?                     Major civil rights legislation passed by Congress includes:                         The       Civil Rights Act of 1964. This landmark bill was intended to help African       Americans become equal citizens, but includes religion, sex and national       origin in the groups it protects from employment discrimination. It prohibits       discrimination by businesses that serve the public; state and local       governments; entities that receive federal money; and employers. It also       authorized the federal government to sue to desegregate public schools,       and required equal application of voter registration requirements.                       The       Voting Rights Act of 1965. This bill ended literacy tests at the polls and       prohibited other devices that could be used to disenfranchise minority       voters.                       The       Equal Pay Act of 1963, which requires employers to give the same pay to       men and women who do the same jobs.                       The       Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in selling, renting or       financing housing on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin,       religion, family status and disability.                       The       Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which protects people over       40 from discrimination based on their age.                       The       Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which requires accommodations for       disabled people in public and at work, and prohibits disability-based       discrimination.                                                                                 DO STATES PROTECT  THEIR CITIZENS CIVIL RIGHTS?                     All states have some form of civil rights legislation, including  civil rights written into state constitutions. Frequently, a state has multiple  laws protecting citizens civil rights. These laws prohibit discrimination in  the same ways that federal anti-discrimination laws do, but often apply to a  broader group of people and organizations. For example, most prohibit  discrimination by state and local governments, which are not included in many  federal civil rights laws.   States can, and sometimes do, give their citizens civil  rights beyond what federal law allows. For example, 17 states prohibit  discrimination based on sexual orientation.                                                              WHAT CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS APPLY TO CRIMINAL CASES?                     If you are accused of a crime, you have the right to:                                                                  Have       your rights read to you. These rights are sometimes called your Miranda       rights, after the court case that made them mandatory.                       Have       non-excessive bail set.                        Have a       grand jury decide whether you should be indicted.                       Be free       of unreasonable searches and seizures of property. That is, law       enforcement must have a warrant.                       Be       free of cruel and unusual punishment. Courts still debate what is       considered cruel and unusual.                       Have a       trial by a jury of fellow citizens.                       Have a       speedy trial in public.                       Not be       compelled to testify against yourself. This is the right to take the       Fifth.                       Not to       be tried twice for the same crime, which is sometimes called double       jeopardy.                       Seek       relief from unlawful imprisonment. You do this with a writ of  habeas corpus .                                                                                                     WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I THINK MY CIVIL RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED?                     If you believe your civil rights were violated, you should  save as much paperwork and other written information as possible thats related  to the incident. If there is a state or federal government agency that can  help, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, you should contact  that agency to discuss your case, and bring the documentation. In some cases,  you can also try complaining directly to the person or organization that  violated your rights. However, this can sometimes lead to illegal retaliation  against you.                                            If you cant find a remedy directly or through an agency,  you should contact a civil rights lawyer. Bring your documentation to show the  civil rights lawyer, and try to answer all of his or her questions as  thoroughly as possible. If the civil rights lawyer agrees to represent you, you  will file a lawsuit against the person or entity that violated your rights. In  a civil rights lawsuit, you can win back any financial losses, reinstatement of  a job or property that was taken and other damages. In a criminal case, winning  a civil rights case can mean freedom even if youve been convicted.                                                                                    PAYMENT                     Civil rights lawyers usually work on contingency. That means  they dont ask for lawyers fees up front; instead, they take a percentage of  clients winnings. You should agree in advance with your civil rights lawyer on  what this percentage will be. If you dont win the case, the civil rights lawyer  doesnt get paid at all. This allows civil rights lawyers to represent  individuals who might not be able to afford to pay a lawyer throughout a long  case.                                            Some civil rights lawyers are public interest lawyers, which  means they work for nonprofit organizations seeking to serve low-income people,  or which seek to advance a point of view. These organizations will not ask for  payment, or ask only for very little payment. However, because they dont have  much money, they must be extremely selective about which cases they take.

Civil Rights Acts       Also found in:  Wikipedia  0.04 sec.         Federal legislation enacted by Congress over the course of a century beginning with the post-Civil War era that implemented and extended the fundamental guarantees of the Constitution to all citizens of the United States, regardless of their race, color, age, or religion.   The Civil Rights Acts of 1866 (14 Stat. 27) and 1870 (16 Stat. 140) were enacted to give newly freed slaves the same rights under federal law as those afforded to non-slaves. Such rights were the rights to sue and be sued, the rights to own real and  Personal Property , and the rights to testify and present evidence in legal proceedings. Serious questions existed, however, as to the constitutionality of the 1866 act and to whether Congress actually had authority to enact such a measure. Subsequent to the passage of the  Fourteenth Amendment  in 1868, Congress reenacted the act pursuant to its power under the amendment to enforce the amendment through appropriate legislation. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was, therefore, superseded by the  Civil Rights  Act of 1870.   In 1875 Congress passed a third Civil Rights Act (18 Stat. 336) in response to the refusal of many whites who owned public establishments, inns, railroads, and other facilities to make them equally available to blacks. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 prohibited  racial discrimination  in such places and guaranteed ""full and equal enjoyment"" of such places.   Violations of this act abounded and criminal prosecutions ensued. A number of convictions were appealed to the  Supreme Court of the United States  which in 1883 declared the act unconstitutional in the  civil rights cases,  109 U.S. 3, 3 S. Ct. 18, 27 L. Ed. 835. The Court reasoned that the social rights that the act safeguarded were not civil rights and, therefore, Congress was powerless to legislate on the social conduct of private individuals. Following this decision, states began enacting  Segregation  into various laws, the most notorious of which were the  Jim Crow Laws . It took more than eighty years before Congress would again attempt to legislate in this area.   The Civil Rights Acts of 1957 represented congressional recognition that the federal government had to bring about an end to racial discrimination. The  civil rights commission  was established and the laws guaranteed qualified voters the right to vote, regardless of their color. In the years 1964 to 1968 Congress enacted extensive and far-reaching legislation affording blacks equal status under the law, ranging from full and free enjoyment of public accommodations and facilities to the prohibition of racial discrimination in employment as well as transactions affecting housing in the United States.   The Civil Rights Act of 1991 granted to victims of unlawful discrimination the right to seek money damages, jury trials, and back pay.
