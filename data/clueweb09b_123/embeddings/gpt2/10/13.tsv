It's important to reserve the equipment well in advance. Be sure to             right down the confirmation number when making reservations over the             phone.               Most rental packages require a             deposit. Many companies now allow customers to start the rental             reservation process on line. Still it's best to call the company and             inquire about equipment availability.

This is a time to explore yourself. Principles             and traditions that are important to you. An opportunity to express             the depth of your love and trust in your husband to be.                             Your wedding takes on special meaning when you surround yourself             with your most precious relationships. Besides the husband to be             you'll want to keep close contact with family and best friends.             Remember that you cannot please everyone. What's most important is             who this most honored occasion is for, the uniting of Bride and             Groom as husband and wife.                             Brides Maids and Groomsmen                            When putting together your choice of brides maids and groomsmen you             may wish your wedding party could be twice it's size. Fear not,             there is way to go about the selection while giving              others  a major part in the wedding program.  Choosing Wedding Party                               So Many Friends and Relatives!                The longer the list the higher the expense.
