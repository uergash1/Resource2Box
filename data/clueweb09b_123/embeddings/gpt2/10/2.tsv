Thomas and James are both upset; Philip appears to want an explanation. On the far right of the painting is the final group of three: Matthew, Jude Thaddeus, and Simon the Zealot. They are engaged in conversation amongst themselves, as if Matthew and Jude are hoping to get some sort of explanation from Simon.   As our eyes move across the painting, shifting from one apostle's reaction to the next, one thing which may become evident is how human the depiction of each figure is. There are no halos or any other marker of holiness - not even any symbols of divinity around Jesus himself. Every person is a human being, reacting in a human way. It is thus the human aspect of the moment which Leonardo Da Vinci was trying to capture and express, not the sacred or divine aspects usually focused on in Christian liturgy.

Thus the reactions of all the disciples are the reactions to hearing that one of them is a traitor to Jesus who would cause the death of their teacher. Each reacts in a different way.   On the far left of the painting are grouped Bartholomew, James the Lesser and Andrew, with Andrew throwing up his hand as if to say ""stop!"" The fact that he is to be betrayed by someone who is eating with him at that time heightens the enormity of the act - in the ancient world, people who break bread together were assumed to have established a bond with each other, one not lightly broken.   The vindictiveness with which Jesus describes the betrayer is, however, very strange. Jesus makes it clear that he knows that the events he is experiencing are predetermined by God: he, the Son of man, goes where it is ""written"" that he must. Isn't the same true of Judas? Doesn't he ""goeth, as it is written of him""? If so, then it's unreasonable for him to be punished so harshly that he would wish that he ""had never been born."" Only an evil deity would punish a person for acting in exactly the way that the deity desired.   Also curious are the reactions of Jesus' disciples: instead of asking who the betrayer would be, each asks in turn if he will be the betrayer. Most normal people wouldn't wonder if they will end up betraying their teacher. Asking this question indicates that they, too, recognize that they are playing roles in some grand drama where the beginning, middle, and end of the script have already been written by God.

For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, ""This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me."" In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, ""This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."" For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of the ceremony directly from the Lord, that is to say, by  revelation .

Location       Main article:  Cenacle       According to tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).

Many separate, but related religious groups of that era shared similar mystic, eschatological, messianic, and ascetic beliefs. ...     Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room that the Last Supper was held in and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.       Bread and wine              The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       In the course of the Last Supper, according to  Paul  and the  Synoptic Gospels  (but not the  Gospel of John ), Jesus divides up some bread, says a prayer (see also  grace ), and hands the pieces to his disciples, saying  this is my body . He then takes a cup of  wine , (known as the  Holy Grail ), offers another prayer, and hands it around, saying  this is my blood of the everlasting 'covenant', which is poured for many  . Finally, according to Paul and Luke, he tells the disciples  do this in memory of me . These words signify the whole point in the final meal. Jesus wants the disciples to remember him, and his ways even in death, because he knows that they will again be reunited in the kingdom of God.

During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official Passover dinner, and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626), although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.

This institute has been regarded by Christians of different denominations as the first  Eucharist  or  Holy Communion . Jesus' behaviour may be derived from a passage in the  Book of Isaiah , where  Isaiah 53:12  refers to a blood sacrifice that  Moses  is described in  Exodus  as having made in order to seal a covenant with God  Exodus 24:8 . Scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' behaviour as him asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).

According to the Canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be Judas. Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man !

It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where  Judas Iscariot  is specifically singled out. This is the very moment poignantly portrayed in  Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper .   The Gospel of Matthew (literally, according to Matthew; Greek, ÎšÎ±Ï„Î¬ ÎœÎ±Î¸Î¸Î±Î¯Î¿Î½ or ÎšÎ±Ï„Î¬ ÎœÎ±Ï„Î¸Î±Î¯Î¿Î½, Kata Maththaion or Kata Matthaion) is a synoptic gospel in the New Testament, one of four canonical gospels. ...

Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.

Sermon   After the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the Canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapter is written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.

God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must 'abide' in him if they are to 'bear fruit'. The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to  love one another  in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the  greatest love  as being the willingness to  lay down  life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.

Paraclete  means ""comforter"", ""counsellor"", or ""advocate"", and is traditionally understood as referring to the  Holy Spirit . When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  filioque clause  which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the  paraclete  was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this  paraclete  that had been promised.

The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Par-take of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.

Last Supper, Detail from the Middle - Painting by Leonardo Da Vinci, 1498 From  Austin Cline , About.com    See More About: leonardo da vinci da vinci code jesus holy grail last supper            Dan Brown's book The Da Vinci Code is about finding the Holy Grail, but Brown's religious ideas are as bad as the orthodoxy he contradicts. Prev Next Gallery Index Image  5  of  7 Last Supper, painting by Leonardo Da Vinci, 1498, Detail from the Middle To Jesus' immediate right are Judas, Peter, and John in another group of three. Judas is in shadow, clutching the bag of silver he was paid for betraying Jesus. He is also reaching for a piece of bread just as Jesus is saying to Thomas and James (seated to Jesus' left) that the betrayer would take a piece of bread from Jesus.   Peter appears very angry here and is holding a knife, both of which may be allusions to how he will react in Gethsemane when Jesus is betrayed and arrested. John, the youngest of the twelve apostles, appears to be swooning at the news.   With the stage set, let's consider the claim made by Dan Brown and followers of his ideas is that there is no cup in Leonardo Da Vinci's  Last Supper . They use this as evidence for the idea that the ""real"" Holy Gail wasn't a cup at all, but Mary Magdalene who was married to Jesus and the mother of his child whose descendants were, among others, the Merovingian Dynasty. This terrible ""secret"" is supposed to be something that Catholic Church officials are willing to kill over.   The problem for this theory is that it's plainly false: Jesus is obviously pointing to a cup with his right hand, even as his left hand is pointing to a piece of bread (the Eucharist). Leonardo Da Vinci worked hard to make his art as realistic as possible so this ' some magnificent, jewel-encrusted chalice used by kings; instead, it's a simple cup that would be used by a simple carpenter (though not of clay, as it probably would have been).    Anyone who has seen  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  will be familiar with what's going on here; Dan Brown, it seems, has chosen poorly.

The Last Supper  ( Convent of Sta. Maria delle Grazie ,  Milan ,  Italy  (1498), by  Leonardo da Vinci ).       In the Christian  Gospels , the  Last Supper  (also called the  Lord's Supper  or  Mystical Supper ) was the last meal  Jesus  shared with his  Twelve Apostles  and  disciples  before  his death . The Last Supper has been the subject of many paintings, perhaps  the most famous  by  Leonardo da Vinci .   According to what  Paul the Apostle  recounted in  1 Corinthians 11:2326 , in the course of the Last Supper, and with specific reference to eating bread and drinking from a cup, Jesus told his disciples, ""Do this in remembrance of me"". Other events and dialogue are recorded in the  Synoptic Gospels  and the  Gospel of John . Many Christians describe this as the ""Institution of the  Eucharist "" (see  Maundy Thursday ).   The vessel which was used to serve the wine is sometimes called the  Holy Chalice , and has been the one of the supposed subjects of  Holy Grail  literature in  Christian mythology .

Paul the Apostle was the first to write of the Last Supper. He wrote:     For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.  ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of this ""from the Lord"", without specifying whether he learned it by a direct revelation, or through intermediaries. All three  Synoptic Gospels [ 1 ] also recount, in similar words, the same event. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Location       Main article:  Cenacle       According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the Passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).   Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6 metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.     [ edit ]   Bread and wine          The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       The Synoptic Gospels and Paul recount that Jesus took some bread, said a prayer (which Matthew and Mark refer to as a ""blessing"", Luke and Paul as a "" giving thanks ""), gave the pieces to his disciples, and told them: ""This is my body."" At the end of the meal, he took a cup (Luke mentions another cup at the start of the meal), probably of  wine , offered a prayer (a ""thanksgiving"" in Matthew and Mark, no direct mention in Luke and Paul, who use the adverb ""likewise""), gave it to his disciples, and spoke words associating it with his blood. Paul and Luke mention an instruction to ""do this in memory of me"". And the Eucharist, which ""is recorded as celebrated by the early Christian community at  Jerusalem  and by St Paul on his visit to Troas ( Acts 20:7 )"", was held to have been instituted by Christ. [ 2 ]   Jesus' action may be linked with  Isaiah 53:12 , which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in  Exodus 24:8 ,  Moses  offered in order to seal a covenant with God: scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).     [ edit ]   Possible relation with Passover meal   During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, [ citation needed ]  but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official  Passover  dinner (which occurs on  Nisan  15), and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626) which places it on  Nisan 14 , although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.     [ edit ]   Betrayal          Depiction of Last Supper in the Cathedral of  Freiburg .       According to the canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be  Judas Iscariot . Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born  ( Mark 14:20-21 ).   It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where Judas is specifically singled out.   Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper  poignantly portrays the individual reactions of the  Twelve Apostles  to the statement by Jesus, ""One of you will betray me"" ( Matthew 26:21 ;  Mark 14:18 ;  John 13:21 ).     [ edit ]   Abandonment   As well as the prediction of betrayal, the four canonical gospels recount that Jesus knew the Apostles (disciples) would  fall away .  Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.     [ edit ]   Sermon   At the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapters were written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.   The account in chapters 14-17 of John includes an extended  metaphor  of  Jesus as the true vine . God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must ""abide"" in him if they are to ""bear fruit"". The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to ""love one another"" in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the ""greatest love"" as being the willingness to ""lay down"" life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.   The sermon goes on to talk of Jesus' sending ""another  paraclete "" ( Greek :    ), a ""Spirit of Truth"" that will ""testify about"" Jesus ( John 14:16 ). Paraclete  comes from the Koine Greek word  (parakltos, ""one who consoles, one who intercedes on our behalf, a comforter or an advocate""). When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  Filioque , which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the paraclete was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this paraclete that had been promised.     [ edit ]   Remembrances       Main article:  Maundy Thursday              The Last Supper from the Heilig-Blut-Altar by  Tilman Riemenschneider  in St-Jakobskirche,  Rothenburg ob der Tauber , Germany.       The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus ""took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.'""  Mark 14:22-24  (cf.  Matthew 26:26-28  and  Luke 22:19-20 ). Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7), and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   These meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the  Mass  in the Catholic Church, and as the  Divine Liturgy  in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name ""Eucharist"" is from the Greek word    (eucharistia) which means ""thanksgiving"".   Each major division of Christianity has formed often different theologies about the exact meaning and purpose of these remembrance ceremonies, but most of them are similar.     [ edit ]   Agape       Main article:  Agape feast               Palma il Vecchio 's the Last Supper.               Jacopo Bassano 's the Last Supper.       Early Christianity  observed a ritual meal known as the "" agape feast "" [ 3 ]  These ""love feasts"" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the  Lord's Day , to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.  Jude , and the apostle Paul referred to these as ""your love-feasts"", by way of warning (about ""who shows up"" to these). Following the meal, as at the Last Supper, the apostle, bishop or priest prayed the words of institution over bread and wine which was shared by all the faithful present. [ citation needed ]  In the later half of the first century, especially after the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, passages from the writings of the apostles were read and preached upon before the blessing of the bread and wine took place. [ citation needed ]   Some supposed revivals of the ""agape meal"" are found in ""fellowship"", or "" potluck "" dinners held at some churches.     [ edit ]   Name           Simon Ushakov 's  icon  of the  Mystical Supper .       In the  Eastern Orthodox Church , the Last Supper is referred to as the  Mystical Supper , because it is the Institution of the  Sacred Mysteries  (Sacrament) of the Body and Blood of Christ. The scene is often depicted above the  Holy Doors  in Orthodox churches, because it is here that the faithful stand to receive  Holy Communion . The name indicates the Orthodox belief that the institution is more than a simple ""memorial meal"", but is the actual mystical union of the faithful with God.   Many Christians speak of the institution of the Eucharist as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the  prophet   Jeremiah , and believe this  prophesy  was fulfilled at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Partake of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is considered to be the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   In another variation of the name of the Eucharistic service - not of the Last Supper itself - is ""The Lord's Supper"". This name is often used by the churches of minimalist traditions, such as those strongly influenced by  Zwingli .   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  commonly refers to the service as ""The Sacrament"". In their services,  LDS  churches typically substitute water for the wine used by Jesus at the Last Supper.

The book has been widely cited as being in the tradition of  Oswald Chambers ' devotional guide decades earlier. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Criticism   A Lutheran perspective is that Warren fails to present the evangelical Christian gospel accurately--failing to accurately represent the nature of  sin , repentance and hell, as well as the blood sacrifice of God's son  Jesus  as the means to be forgiven by God for sins and which allows man to have a relationship with God. [ 6 ]  Warren has been accused of absolving his readers of moral responsibility by making Satan into an all-pervasive godlike figure contrary to both orthodox theology and psychological soundness. [ 7 ]  It has been suggested that when citing Scripture, Warren jumps from one Bible version to another, cherry-picking whichever paraphrase or translation supports whatever point he attempts to convey, [ 8 ]  although the practice of using translations selectively has been defended. [ 9 ]  Warren's statement that ""Whenever God wanted to prepare someone for his purposes, he took forty days"" [ 10 ]  has been criticized as both overly broad and contradicted by Scripture.

The Last Supper has been the subject of many paintings, perhaps  the most famous  by  Leonardo da Vinci .   According to what  Paul the Apostle  recounted in  1 Corinthians 11:2326 , in the course of the Last Supper, and with specific reference to eating bread and drinking from a cup, Jesus told his disciples, ""Do this in remembrance of me"". Other events and dialogue are recorded in the  Synoptic Gospels  and the  Gospel of John . Many Christians describe this as the ""Institution of the  Eucharist "" (see  Maundy Thursday ).   The vessel which was used to serve the wine is sometimes called the  Holy Chalice , and has been the one of the supposed subjects of  Holy Grail  literature in  Christian mythology .

He wrote:     For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.  ( 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 )     Paul states he learned of this ""from the Lord"", without specifying whether he learned it by a direct revelation, or through intermediaries. All three  Synoptic Gospels [ 1 ] also recount, in similar words, the same event. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Main article:  Cenacle   According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The  Room of the Last Supper  on  Mount Zion , just outside of the walls of the  Old City  of  Jerusalem , and is traditionally known as  The Upper Room . This is based on the account in the  Synoptic Gospels  that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to  the city  to meet a  man carrying a jar of water , who would lead them to a house, where they were to ask for the room where  the teacher  has a guest room. This room is specified as being the upper room, and they  prepare the Passover  there. It is not actually specified where  the city  refers to, and it may refer to one of the  suburbs  of Jerusalem, such as Bethany; the traditional location is not based on anything more specific in the Bible, and may easily be wrong. The traditional location is an area that, according to  archaeology , had a large  Essene  community, adding to the points which make several scholars suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).   Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the coenaculum (crusader - twelfth century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of first century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6 metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.     [ edit ]   Bread and wine          The Last Supper (1594) by  Tintoretto .       The Synoptic Gospels and Paul recount that Jesus took some bread, said a prayer (which Matthew and Mark refer to as a ""blessing"", Luke and Paul as a "" giving thanks ""), gave the pieces to his disciples, and told them: ""This is my body."" At the end of the meal, he took a cup (Luke mentions another cup at the start of the meal), probably of  wine , offered a prayer (a ""thanksgiving"" in Matthew and Mark, no direct mention in Luke and Paul, who use the adverb ""likewise""), gave it to his disciples, and spoke words associating it with his blood. Paul and Luke mention an instruction to ""do this in memory of me"". And the Eucharist, which ""is recorded as celebrated by the early Christian community at  Jerusalem  and by St Paul on his visit to Troas ( Acts 20:7 )"", was held to have been instituted by Christ. [ 2 ]   Jesus' action may be linked with  Isaiah 53:12 , which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in  Exodus 24:8 ,  Moses  offered in order to seal a covenant with God: scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it (Brown et al. 626).     [ edit ]   Possible relation with Passover meal   During Jewish Passover meals, the wine was usually consumed during the eating of the bread, [ citation needed ]  but here it occurs after. This may indicate that the event was not the official  Passover  dinner (which occurs on  Nisan  15), and hence more in line with John's chronology (Brown et al. 626) which places it on  Nisan 14 , although the meal could easily have been altered during the Last Supper for symbolic/religious purposes, or simply because the Gospel writers did not have complete knowledge of Jewish practice, as suggested by their chronologies.   If we follow Corinthians cited above or the Synoptic Gospels, it appears that the cup of wine, which is said to be drunk ""after having eaten"", refers to either the third cup of the Passover Seder, which is held during  grace after meals , or the fourth, on which the  Hallel  is recited.     [ edit ]   Betrayal          Depiction of Last Supper in the Cathedral of  Freiburg .       According to the canonical Gospels, during the meal, Jesus revealed that one of  his Apostles  would betray him and that would be  Judas Iscariot . Despite the assertions of each Apostle that it would not be he, Jesus is described as reiterating that it would be one of those who were present, and goes on to say that there shall be  woe to the man who betrays the  Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born  ( Mark 14:20-21 ).   It is only in the  Gospel of Matthew  ( Matthew 26:23-26:25 ) and  The Gospel of John  ( John 13:26-13:27 ) where Judas is specifically singled out.   Leonardo da Vinci 's  The Last Supper  poignantly portrays the individual reactions of the  Twelve Apostles  to the statement by Jesus, ""One of you will betray me"" ( Matthew 26:21 ;  Mark 14:18 ;  John 13:21 ).     [ edit ]   Abandonment   As well as the prediction of betrayal, the four canonical gospels recount that Jesus knew the Apostles (disciples) would  fall away .  Simon Peter  states that he will not abandon Jesus even if the others do, but Jesus tells him that Peter would deny Jesus thrice before the  cock  had crowed twice. Peter is described as continuing to deny it, stating that he would remain true even if it meant death, and the other apostles are described as stating the same about themselves.     [ edit ]   Sermon   At the meal, according to John, Jesus gave an extended  sermon  to his disciples  John 14-16 . This sermon is sometimes referred to as the  farewell discourse  of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian  doctrine , particularly on the subject of  Christology . Amongst the canonical Gospels, John is unusual in the complexity of its Christology (which has led to  questions about its authenticity ), and this sermon portrays one of the most complex Christological descriptions in John. Although ostensibly an address by Jesus to his disciples, some scholars [ citation needed ]  have theorized that the chapters were written with events concerning the later church in mind, particularly that of the 2nd century. Jesus is presented as explaining the relationship between himself and his followers, and seeking to model this relationship on his own relationship with God.   The account in chapters 14-17 of John includes an extended  metaphor  of  Jesus as the true vine . God is described as the vine tender, and his disciples are said to be branches, which must ""abide"" in him if they are to ""bear fruit"". The disciples are warned that barren branches are pruned by the vinedresser. This image has been influential in Christian art and iconography. The disciples are reminded of the love of God for Jesus, and of Jesus for the disciples (especially the  beloved disciple ), and are then instructed to ""love one another"" in the same manner. It goes on to speak of the ""greatest love"" as being the willingness to ""lay down"" life for one's friends, and this passage has since been widely used to affirm the sacrifice of  martyrs  and soldiers in  war , and is thus often seen on war memorials and graves.   The sermon goes on to talk of Jesus' sending ""another  paraclete "" ( Greek :    ), a ""Spirit of Truth"" that will ""testify about"" Jesus ( John 14:16 ). Paraclete  comes from the Koine Greek word  (parakltos, ""one who consoles, one who intercedes on our behalf, a comforter or an advocate""). When the dogmatic definition of the  Trinity  became necessary in the 3rd century, the passage became central to the arguments about the role of the Holy Spirit. Arguments about the  Filioque , which partly caused the  East-West Schism  between the  Roman Catholic Church  and the  Eastern Orthodox Church , centered around this verse. In some sectors of the early  Jesus movement  the paraclete was considered a more human figure, and, in the 2nd century,  Montanus  claimed that he himself was this paraclete that had been promised.     [ edit ]   Remembrances   Main article:  Maundy Thursday          The Last Supper from the Heilig-Blut-Altar by  Tilman Riemenschneider  in St-Jakobskirche,  Rothenburg ob der Tauber , Germany.       The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the  Luminous Mysteries  of the  Rosary , and by most Christians as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the prophet  Jeremiah , fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus ""took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.'""  Mark 14:22-24  (cf.  Matthew 26:26-28  and  Luke 22:19-20 ). Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" (I Corinthians 5:7), and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   These meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the  Mass  in the Catholic Church, and as the  Divine Liturgy  in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name ""Eucharist"" is from the Greek word    (eucharistia) which means ""thanksgiving"".   Each major division of Christianity has formed often different theologies about the exact meaning and purpose of these remembrance ceremonies, but most of them are similar.     [ edit ]   Agape   Main article:  Agape feast           Palma il Vecchio 's the Last Supper.               Jacopo Bassano 's the Last Supper.       Early Christianity  observed a ritual meal known as the "" agape feast "" [ 3 ]  These ""love feasts"" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the  Lord's Day , to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.  Jude , and the apostle Paul referred to these as ""your love-feasts"", by way of warning (about ""who shows up"" to these). Following the meal, as at the Last Supper, the apostle, bishop or priest prayed the words of institution over bread and wine which was shared by all the faithful present. [ citation needed ]  In the later half of the first century, especially after the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, passages from the writings of the apostles were read and preached upon before the blessing of the bread and wine took place. [ citation needed ]   Some supposed revivals of the ""agape meal"" are found in ""fellowship"", or "" potluck "" dinners held at some churches.     [ edit ]   Name           Simon Ushakov 's  icon  of the  Mystical Supper .       In the  Eastern Orthodox Church , the Last Supper is referred to as the  Mystical Supper , because it is the Institution of the  Sacred Mysteries  (Sacrament) of the Body and Blood of Christ. The scene is often depicted above the  Holy Doors  in Orthodox churches, because it is here that the faithful stand to receive  Holy Communion . The name indicates the Orthodox belief that the institution is more than a simple ""memorial meal"", but is the actual mystical union of the faithful with God.   Many Christians speak of the institution of the Eucharist as the ""inauguration of the  New Covenant "", mentioned by the  prophet   Jeremiah , and believe this  prophesy  was fulfilled at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, ""Take, eat; this [bread] is My Body; which is broken for you. Partake of the cup, drink; this [wine] is My Blood, which is shed for many; for the remission of sins"". Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance as a change to the  Passover  ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become ""our Passover, sacrificed for us"" ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ). Partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is considered to be the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.   In another variation of the name of the Eucharistic service - not of the Last Supper itself - is ""The Lord's Supper"". This name is often used by the churches of minimalist traditions, such as those strongly influenced by  Zwingli .   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  commonly refers to the service as ""The Sacrament"". In their services,  LDS  churches typically substitute water for the wine used by Jesus at the Last Supper.

Warren, who's at the center of a growing controversy over his inaugural invitation from the president-elect, said Prop. 8 became more about free speech than anything else. Speaking of free speech, as reported here, the  L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center  strongly criticized Obama  on Thursday for his invitation to Warren to pray with the immense crowd at the opening of the inaugural ceremony. The group also demanded that the Democratic president-elect disinvite Warren from participating.    Obama has said  he doesn't agree with some things Warren says  and vice versa, but Warren invited him to speak in August at the Saddleback Forum. And, Obama adds, disagreeing with someone doesn't mean being disagreeable to each other. That's something his campaign has preached about for two years. Listen to Obama explain it himself on the video.     Warren, who heads the mega-church Saddleback in Lake Forest, says he's got no problem with gays having relationships; just don't call it marriage, he says. Marriage is between one man and one woman and has been for 5,000 years in numerous religions.    Warren also points out that his congregation has donated many millions of dollars to help gays with AIDS, which couldn't possibly be labeled homophobic.

You have to be very, *very* out of touch to be unaware of what a sore spot that is.  People in the LGBT community often hear from far-right religious conservatives that AIDS was a punishment from god for their ""sinful lifestyle.""  I find it rather interesting that Warren keeps statistics on how many of his charity recipients are homosexual.    There is a lot of effort to downplay this issue right now, and to the LGBT community it is a deep frustration.  We view Warren's position as homophobic, and homophobia itself to be another form of racism.  To us, allowing Warren to give this speech would be identical to allowing a Klansman to swear in a president in the 1950s.  Disagree with this position if you choose, but to suggest that there's little symbolic importance to Warren's speech is to completely fail to grasp the way that LGBT activists view the issue.             Posted by:    Schmidty |     December 19, 2008 at 08:56 AM                       It's the height of hypocrisy on both their parts.  This invitation should have been politely declined by Pastor Warren on the grounds that he and Obama have values that are diametrically opposed to one another and would cause dissent rather than goodwill on both sides of the fence.  This mutual decision diminishes the credibility of both men and puts a damper on what would otherwise be a momentous occasion.             Posted by:    DSciulla |     December 19, 2008 at 08:57 AM                       Rick Warren focuses on AIDS in Africa, where the preponderance of cases are among straight people. He ignores AIDS in California and AIDS within the gay community. Jesus healed everybody, Rick.     Further, any pastor who fuses politics with religion in the way Warren does (even though he claims not to, lying is a sin, Rick) is not civil. Warren compared homosexuality to pedophilia. That's civil? He compared abortion to the holocaust? That's civil? Hypocrisy is a sin, Rick. He questioned the faith of progressive Christians and accused us of being Marxists (Godless) tools of the Democratic Party. Questioning my faith is civil? Bearing false witness against a fellow believer is a sin Rick.     What Rick Warren is really about is $elling his books and acquiring fame. And just like his minions on the far-right, he has a gigantic ego. And he knowingly and willingly fuels the flames of the culture war to get what he wants. Beneath the fuzzy beard, is Jerry Falwell in a Hawaiian shirt. It probably won't be long until Rick accuses Elmo of being gay propaganda.

Posted by:    steve rodriguez |     December 19, 2008 at 10:49 AM                       Obama has no reason to help gays & lesbians. Democrats will always have the bulk of the gay vote, & they don't need to do anything to get it, as gays & lesbians know that Republican treatment would be worse.  So, Democrats give lip service to gays & lesbians just to make sure that they go out & vote. After that, Democrats have no incentive to help gays; it would just upset the bulk of Americans.  Obama is a typical Democrat.  Then again, Lincoln was hated in his time, & the Emancipation Proclamation was condemned by most everyone when it was introduced.  Maybe people should think on that sometime--it is a fantasy, no politician will ever help gays & lesbians--but sometimes it's something to think about.

Marriage is between one man and one woman and has been for 5,000 years in numerous religions.""    So what?    How many thousands of years in numerous lands did slavery exist?  Seems there were quite a few slaves and concubines and multiple wives approvingly mentioned in the Bible.  We'd probably still be slaves now if it were up to the Bible.  Yet the Bible [or its self-appointed interpreters and enforcers] is supposed to define marriage for us, too.    Are we living in a theocracy?  Who just got elected President, Barack Obama or Rick Warren?  Does Rick Warren think he has the right to dictate what constitutes civil marriage?             Posted by:    tomk |     December 19, 2008 at 12:03 PM                       Pastor Warren sets a good example of true charity.It's  one thing to deplore aids and insist on government funding  but it is the mark of a true Christian to put up his own  money in a significant way.Equal rights does not equate  to granting homosexual mariage.Pope John Paul showed  us the light when he said to love your homosexual neighbor but condemn homosexual acts.Homosexual  exhibitionism such as so called gay pride parades serve  only to scandalize and poison the minds of vulnerable  and curious young minds.What responsable parent wants his or her teenagers to watch such turpitude?             Posted by:     Praise the Lord  |     December 19, 2008 at 12:22 PM                       Ok, so according to Rick Warren, Gay Marriage is the same as Incest, Polygomy and Pedophilia.   I guess he would also allow rights for all of those unless it is called Marriage.  Religious people should stay out of politics, makes them look stupid.             Posted by:    Taylor |     December 19, 2008 at 01:46 PM                       If Rick Warren had been anti-Black, anti-Hispanic, anti-Asian, anti-Jew, anti-any other minority other than gay, then he would not have been given a place at Obama's inaugural table because it would have been wrong to give such a person a platform in which to give validity to their bigotry.  But since Warren is anti-gay, Obama tries to defend his choice by saying he wants to listen to differing viewpoints.  Bigotry is bigotry, no matter what rhetoric you wrap it in.  If we are to use Obama's failed logic on this issue, then white supremacists should have a chair at Obama's inaugural table (but they won't because we know their positions on social issues are wrong, just as Rick Warren is wrong).  Obama blew it with this one.  It is painfully obvious to anyone with a brain that this is simply pandering to the radical religious whack jobs who have held this country hostage, via the Bush regime, for the last 8 years.  With this most egregious of decisions, Obama has flushed his credibility down the toilet.  This is not change we can believe in.  This is just more of the same garbage that gay people have had to deal with the last 8 years.  And it stinks.  Obama benefitted greatly from gay people's, their friends', and their families' financial donations and their votes (including financial donations and vote from this gay person).  And how are we repaid?  We are thrown under the bus.  The hearts and minds of a huge segment of the U.S. population are lost by such a purely political maneuver, and we cannot be one people/one country because of it.  Here's hoping Obama wises up.  If he wants to fix this country, he's going to need everyone's involvement, and right now, gays, their families, and friends are feeling like their involvement in cleaning up this country is neither wanted nor desired.  Not a good message.  Not a good way to begin Obama's presidency.  Not good at all.  And there's no excuse for it.                 Posted by:    Russ |     December 19, 2008 at 02:31 PM                       Rick Warren will get his in hell with the others who use God as a means for power and profit.    Obama is a fool to invite this demon in.             Posted by:    Sally |     December 19, 2008 at 03:19 PM                       I am disgusted that Obama chose this right wing extreamist to give the invocation. It makes me sick to think that this man and not a mainstream or moderate religous leader is give this honor. I am starting to think Hillary WAS the better choice.             Posted by:    Carlin |     December 19, 2008 at 03:21 PM                       Warren says that   'Marriage is between one man and one woman and has been for 5,000 years in numerous religions.'  And in numerous religions,marriage has not been between one man and one woman.  His weasel words befit a politician rather than a minister.    Marriage is not merely a religious term.  It is a state institution or construct and carries with it many legal benefits.    Marriage, as a matter of law, is not merely a ""privilege"" as I heard Huckabee recently claim.  As a matter of constitutional law, marriage is a right.  Moreover, it is a fundamental right, and any law impinging on that right is subject to strict scrutiny.    That is why prop 8 will ultimately fail.  While there may be a sufficient state interest to define marriage as a union between 2 adult unrelated people, there is no  (non-religious) interest that could possibly be compelling enough to deny 2 gay adults the right to marry.  Conversely, there are compelling reasons to allow them to marry.    There is a reason why in this country we have the rule of law.  The rule of law protects the rights of minorities from majority discrimination and worse.     As  constitutional law scholar, Obama knows this.               Posted by:    Jan |     December 19, 2008 at 09:47 PM                       I, like so many of my gay friends, gave a lot of money to Obama's campaign. We worked tirelessly to get him elected. Now Obama decides to invite Rick Warren, who equates gays to rapists and child molesters; and who excludes gays from being members of his church to do the invocation?  How many of Warren's followers do you think gave as much to the campaign as gays did?  How many of Warren's followers worked as hard to get Obama elected as gays did?  Warren is to gays what a Grand Wizard of the KKK is to African Americans.  Obama has made it perfectly clear with this invitation how he feels about the gay community.      Do you think Obama would have had as much of a landslide if it wasn't for the gay community?  I don't think so.  I hope for his sake that all the evangelicals he is pandering to move over to his camp come reelection time; gays will be voting for a third party candidate from now on. It's been made perfectly clear that the Democrats don't want us. Good luck to Obama with his presidency.  I don't support him any longer. I, like so many fell utterly betrayed.

God Bless you and your ministry.             Posted by:    Patricia Weisz |     December 20, 2008 at 07:32 AM                       It seems strange that a preacher who holds to the bible would be approve of homosexuality in any form or label. I doubt that Rick Warren actually is ""okay"" with it. I think what he really implied is that he is okay with it being legal (just like it's legal to smoke cigarettes). Whether Obama believes that gays should have the same rights as married people, he is trying to distance himself from far left-wing preachers. This does not mean he endorses Warren's beliefs or political opinions. Also, why does who prays at the inauguration have to be a political statement? I generally dislike Obama's politics, but criticizing the man for honoring a religious leader who was respectful towards him seems ridiculous and petty. Of course, in recent years, the gay community has always been known to be loud and obnoxious about EVERY perceived slight. Free publicity, eh? I believe the constant push for attention from gays is backfiring ala prop 8. If you guys actually want to sway people, don't whine about the small stuff. It only serves to energize your opposition.             Posted by:    Brian |     December 20, 2008 at 08:02 AM                       The last place I thought I'd be posting a comment is the LA Times.  However, I'm getting tired of this...    Yes, Warren's views are contrary to certain groups of individuals - and he has certainly vocalized his strong opinions.    But strong opinions are not unique to Warren.      Those that disagree with him have very strong opinions too - and these are also well vocalized.    To me, tolerance is a two way street.  Those that demand tolerance should walk the walk.      In my mind, there is going to be controversy regarding same sex marriage for many years to come.      However, to demand censorship of an individual - because of a single aspect of one's beliefs - seems to me at least - just as intolerant.    Obama has not claimed agreement with all - including his own cabinet members (a marked change from his predecessor who installed ""yes man"" at every corner).      To that end, this innocuous pick should be seen for what it is - a political calculation designed to dampen suspicion and even instill goodwill among his most vocal opponents: the evangelical right.    And make no mistake, the goodwill thus created could - and by all statistics WOULD - outstrip any displeasure and acrimony that the vocal minority in the LGBT community could generate.    In fact, such displeasure would - and will - only prompt a longer and more reflective pause for the right to re-examine their attitudes regarding Obama.  This is part of his calculation and it WILL work - to a greater or lesser degree.      The LGBT constituency is a lock.  Most of this said base exist in States that are very light blue - and are of no real threat.  Their non-support in future would mean little.      The right - on the other hand - could ensure an overwhelming victory in 2012 - only if he plays his cards ""right""...    Obama believes it's a gamble worth taking...(regardless of the noisy outrage that it will prompt - and which will again - promote and project an image that the far more numerous right can live with and possibly support)...    The editorials contained herein and the loud complaints aired over the networks only advance his position amongst those that he is trying to connect with at this time...

Wright preach hate in Jesus' name.  All those liberals out there who voted for Obama should not be surprised then that Obama asked Rick Warren, another preacher of hate in Jesus' name, to pray that Jesus damn all American gays and Jews to hell. Obama is and will always be a divisionist revisionist, just look at his cabinet choices.  Get ready for a bumpy ride.

Posted by:    walter |     December 21, 2008 at 12:45 PM                       Dear Mr President-Elect & his Transition Team,    Considering the promises & circumstances of your campaign, this Inauguration belongs to ALL people. To have Pastor Warren to deliver the Invocation is a fundamental antithesis to what we hope your presidency will be. His advocacy to categorically strip civil rights from a group of citizens will forever mar this historical event. There will be other occasions for dialogue & reconciliation for the contending issues, but this invitation to Pastor Warren is definitely inappropriate for the symbolic re-birth of the great nation, and is clearly disrespectful to your millions of supporters who yearn for a fair & just society.    Sincerely yours,    Pak TAM    Help our voice to be heard!

Rick Warren publicly compares rape of a minor by an adult or sex between a brother and sister with two consenting in love adults of the same sex! He was a general in the war to push prop 8 in California which constitutionalized the exclusion of a certain right for a certain segment of the population which is afforded to the greater part of the population. This is not acceptable in a new America moving in a new direction not full of hate and disdain for anyone unlike ourselves which is what this preacher openly stands for. Obama disassociated with pastor Wright who married him and his wife, whose church he attended happily for a considerably long time - just because Wright had obvious difficulty controlling his painbody, built justifiably mostly if not entirely on being a part of a peoples who suffered through slavery Jim crow separate but almost equal etc to the point that it actually touched his lifetime. Yet Obama invites this preacher Rick Warren to give the inaugural invocation - someone who views with the worst disdain a segment of our population who at no time ever caused any harm to him or his family or friends - simply because they do not stand for the same principles as he does and he doesnt approve of what they do in private which is no different than what he or others he DOES relate to do in their private moments. It is just not fair to allow him this celebratory platform which can not help but express his totality of beliefs including his candy-coated hate for the simple fact that he so openly expresses them elsewhere. And this is not the message the world and us need to hear. Not on such an important occasion for sure! Please reconsider letting Rick Warren speak or pray at your event. The passing of prop 8 was one of the few dark clouds that loomed and wrecked havoc on an otherwise phenomenal choosing of Obama as pres elect. Now that same threat threatens to rain on the opening ceremony of what should be one of the brightest days in American history. Rick Warren also openly admits in the past that anyone who does not believe in his god is well on the path of ultimate doom. In the words of Obama, ""While we have come a long way since the Stonewall riots in 1969, we still have a lot of work to do. Too often, the issue of LGBT rights is exploited by those seeking to divide us. But at its core, this issue is about who we are as Americans. It's about whether this nation is going to live up to its founding promise of equality by treating all its citizens with dignity and respect."" -- Barack Obama, June 1, 2007. How can Rick Warren be allowed this honor with such an acting divisive agenda at hand? There are so many god loving evangelical pastors and such who openly and inwardly express openness and compassion to and for all, seeing each and all of us as gods children. Obama should choose someone else other than Rick Warren. The nation is already sensitive about separation between church and state. As a non-follower of any religion myself , my heart and mind are certainly open to religious peoples who have love, kindness and blessings for all. It is not religion that is scary. What is scary is the teaching of intolerance and acting apon it, done in the name of religion or not. I would be open to meeting and acting friendly towards Warren if he were to treat me with the same respect I would expect of myself towards him, regardless of his personal views. But only to work together on building an understanding and respect for each other. Not to listen to him preach as if he were no part of limiting the rights and freedom of loving individuals who only wish to fully express their love for each other in the same way most others legally do. Rick Warren DOES deserve the dignity and respect he wont himself afford the LGBT community  YES. That does not include just handing him a platform to show himself off for the whole world to see - along with all his past, present and future institutionalized hateful actions beside him. No matter how sugar coated his words may be for the inaugural invocation, elsewhere he is actively and successfully working against respect and dignity for all, even through changes in law and constitution (prop 8. Ca.). Rick Warren as mellow a demeanor he may have is an acting divisive evangelical who wants no part of equal respect, dignity and rights for all individuals  period. He not only gives a bad name to evangelicals - He also gives a bad name to all of us if allowed to cast his darkness of  non-respect and disregard of dignity for all behind his words of inaugural invocation. There are so many god loving evangelical pastors and such who openly and inwardly express openness and compassion to and for all, seeing each and all of us as gods children. Obama should choose someone else other than Rick Warren to reflect the aspect of our society he is looking to showcase through Warren  please. It is offensive to all of us if he is allowed to give the inaugural invocation. As a straight person myself, I sense no separation between the suffering of others and myself. And I have seen many peoples lives affected by prop 8 first hand and find no comfort that their lack of full dignity and respect by people and now by STATE CONSTITUTION does not affect me the same. It still saddens my heart and mind and creates an oppressive environment for all of us. Even Jerry Brown AG of Ca. has now decided prop 8 is unconstitutional. Yet Rick Warren does not care about the constitution and only wishes to further his religiously oriented political agenda by maintaining his stance that any overturning of prop 8 would be a violation of the will of the voters  that is not how law and the constitution work. There are safeguards in place to protect majority rule over minority groups in areas such as assuring rights and freedoms are equal to all. Rick Warren does not reflect anything we as a nation or a world should be proud of other than his sugar-coated general appearance, tone and mannerism. When it comes to specific rights and freedom for all along with the dignity and respect they entail, Rick Warren has little to no regard for the dignity and respect of people who do not think like he does to the point of ACTIVELY limiting their freedoms and rights through INSTITUTIONALIZED HATETRED! Which not only brings great pain and sorrow to the LGBT community, but to their families and friends lives as well. Again, There are so many god loving evangelical pastors and such who openly and inwardly express openness and compassion to and for all, seeing each and all of us as gods children. Obama should choose someone else other than Rick Warren to reflect the aspect of our society you were looking to showcase through Warren  please             Posted by:    james |     December 29, 2008 at 08:22 PM                       Once again religion and politics clash like titans.  When will america be like Jesus instead of thinking they are him and he is theirs.  You all spend so much time trying to convince each other of how holy/or not you are that in the process people are left to die on battle fields across the universe. Jesus was LOVE, unconditional, not religion and I see more of the latter than the former. WAKE UP AMERICA and Mr Obama call on the lord if you will not man.
