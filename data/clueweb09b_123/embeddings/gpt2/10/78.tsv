He painted it on the back wall of the dining hall at the Dominican convent of Sta Maria delle Grazie in Italy. The reason the painting is laid out the way it is is that Leonardo was trying to ""extend the room"", to make it look like Jesus and his apostles were sitting at the end of the dining hall. This painting became an  instant  famous work, for many reasons.         The painting depicts the very moment that Jesus has said to his disciples:    Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.  And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.  And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.  --Matthew 26     The disciples are all reacting in horror to the thought that someone at that table would betray their master.    Fresco vs Tempera  Dan Brown's error in The Da Vinci Code is that he calls the Last Supper a FRESCO. This painting is not a fresco. This is a critical mistake because if the painting had been a fresco, we would still have a superb image to view and examine. It is *because* it is not a fresco that we have all these questions now about what the painting is showing us. In fact, a main reason why the Last Supper painting is so famous is because it is not a fresco - and therefore that it was in essence destroyed immediately after being painted. It's important therefore to understand this issue.    Normally, the way a painting like this would have been done would be a ""fresco"". That means that the plaster is made wet, and then the painting is done on the wet plaster. When the plaster dries, the paint is sort of intermingled with the plaster and it's nice and permanent. However, that type of painting is limited in its colors and can't be retouched. When the plaster dries, you're stuck.   Leonardo wanted to experiment with a new style he had invented - tempera (egg yolk and vinegar) plus oil painting ON dry plaster. That way he could use more colors and redo portions if necessary. The painting took him four years to complete - 1495 to 1498. His patrons were furious at the delay but Leonardo refused to go any more quickly.   Unfortunately, Leonardo's style experiment was a disaster. The paint almost immediately began falling off the plaster. The humidity was causing the paint to separate from the plaster on which it had been painted. Whole pieces of paint fell off the wall. Over the years, the piece has been vandalized and nearly fell apart completely.   A recent 20-year effort tried to stabilize the piece for future viewing. Art experts tried to re-create what they thought the painting must have looked like originally. There is a lot of debate about whether those experts really did ""fix"" the painting, or if they changed its meaning by making changes in color and detail. There's no way to know, really, since the painting had fallen apart so much over the years. Much of what we know about the way this painting was done and the fact that it was NOT a fresco was learned during that repair process. I agree that some websites still claim the painting is a fresco. They are mistaken. You can't trust everything you read on the web :)     The Scene and Design  Leonardo da Vinci was working based on the few known documents which describe this meal. As all artists do, he was trying to convey an impression and message, and took ""artistic license"" with his source material. Just as artists will often rearrange a scene in order to better convey what they are trying to have the viewer feel and think about, so did Leonardo da Vinci rearrange what was *said* about this important event, in order to convey his own thoughts and feelings on the subject. I list a lot of his changes below.   Part of why Leonardo's version was so famous immediately was that he had chosen a very unusual way to portray the scene. Pretty much every painting of the Last Supper up until now had involved Jesus blessing the bread and wine - a nice, serene scene. Judas was always shown off in a corner, sulking, away from the rest of the disciples. This is what the Dominicans thought they were getting. When they instead got this ""violent"" version with the disciples all screaming and yelling, the monks were not exactly pleased. It created a lot of publicity.          Some people are intrigued by the three ""lunettes"" over the painting, not seen in most copies of the painting's image. These are tributes to Leonardo's patron duke. They are in fact the Sforza coat of arms. Leonardo's patron duke was Duke Lodovico Sforza   So the center spot is the arms of the Duke plus his wife Beatrice d'Este. To the left is that of Massimiliano, the first born son. On the right side is Francesco, the second son.     Latin Saying  Some versions of the painting have Latin words beneath it -   Latin Vulgate  26:21 et edentibus illis dixit amen dico vobis quia unus vestrum me traditurus est   King James Version  26:21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.   So it is simply quoting the passage of the Bible that Leonardo was depicting.    If you're curious, the top version of the Last Supper shown on this page was the pre-restoration version, while the second version is the one after restoration.

But are we sure that everything written about Leonardo’s works is true?              The story is gripping and although it is fiction, it does refer to many real events.              Some of these references concern Leonardo and may mislead readers who may think that some or all of the material is factual.                           1. Is it true that a murderer is hidden in the painting of the Last Supper?  2. Did Leonardo invent the Cryptex?                                                                                 1. Is it true that a murderer is hidden in the painting of the Last Supper?             Perhaps not.                                                                                                                            You can see the painting of the Last Supper in Milan, in the convent of S. Maria delle Grazie. The last restoration made it much brighter and “barer” than it was before. So much so that to see it as a whole, it’s easier to look at a printed reproduction.                            Dan Brown referred to it in his novel ""The Da Vinci Code” as proof of the fact that Leonardo wanted to send us a secret message. The apostle to the right of Christ has a somewhat feminine appearance and in the novel is described as Mary Magdalene.                                                                  1.1 Thirteen people at the table                                                                                                                                                                                             1.2 But how many hands are there?                                                                                                                                                             Here we have highlighted only the hands present in the fresco.                             Like many others before him, Dan Brown quoted the legend based on the wrong number of hands. Look carefully and you’ll see that they all belong to their proper owners.                                                                  1.3 A table for thirteen, please!                                                                                                                                                             Here we have highlighted each pair of hands and used a number to identify which of the 13 people they belong to.              1 Bartholomew, 2 James the Less, 3 Andrew, 4 Peter, 5 Judas, 6 John,            7  Jesus , 8 James the Great, 9 Thomas, 10 Philip, 11 Matthew, 12 Thaddeus and 13 Simon the Zealot.                            Where’s the mystery? Didn’t they say there were more hands than people? Look carefully and count again. They’re all there: Thomas has one of his hands immediately below James the Great’s left hand.                                                                     1.4 And what about Peter and John?                                                                                                                                                             In this close-up we see two apostles who seem to be in conversation. Traditionally, these are understood to be Peter talking to John and putting his hand on his shoulder to reassure him.                             Dan Brown implies that, in fact, Peter’s position, with a knife nearby and his hand on John’s neck, seems to mean he is saying something like, “Behave, or you’re dead!” But what if all it means is that Peter is saying, “Excuse me, but could you pass me that piece of bread over there?” What could be more natural than to have a knife in your hand when the table is covered with food?                                                                     1.5 Threatening or reassuring?                                                                                                                                                             Peter is resting one hand on John’s shoulder to reassure him; his other hand, with the knife, is far away and anyway, at a table full of food, you would have a knife.                            Dan Brown suggests that the position is threatening, but by the looks on their faces the apostles don’t seem to be nervous or terrified. On the contrary, they both look quite relaxed.                                                                     1.6 Preparatory studies                                                                                                                                                     Leonardo’s study for the Last Supper - Galleria dell'Accademia, Venice.  Preparation and digital composition of individual sketches.                                               Leonardo made many preparatory studies for his painting of the Last Supper. None of these show any sign of the mysterious and “dangerous” allegories or symbolism conjured up in Brown’s novel. The study of Da Vinci’s manuscripts is fascinating and he emerges as an even greater and more mysterious figure.                              The novel in question has the value of stimulating the curiosity of people who have never before had any interest in Leonardo, but such people must not be misled. The manuscripts are available to anyone who seriously wants to learn more and to study the real mysteries of this genius.                                                                                2 The Cryptex             Did Leonardo have a secret project?                                                                                                                                                                    These pictures represent the Cryptex, as described in the novel. Dan Brown writes that it was Leonardo da Vinci who had the idea of this miniature combination-lock strongbox. Indeed, the illustrated edition of the book includes a page from Leonardo’s manuscripts with a mechanism that appears to be similar to the one used for the Cryptex. The drawing in question is on a page from Manuscript B, folio 33 verso, to be precise. Leonardo’s design has nothing to do with the strongbox featured in the novel and there is no trace of this mechanism in the other Codices. So the author must have invented it. In fact, the drawings on this folio are: a means of wheeled transport, a cannon spindle and various mechanisms relating to a complex system with tip-up boxes of a size much larger than a lockable document box.                                                                                                                 The page shown to readers of the novel is actually page 33v of Manuscript B. The machine described has nothing whatever to do with the Cryptex.                                                  Manuscript B - folio 33 verso.                              Leonardo’s drawings feature a great many more significant and mysterious mechanisms that deserve our attention: we would do well to study them closely. This is what L3 is all about. The fascination with the Cryptex and the confusion it has aroused is an indication of interest in a subject that should be approached with greater seriousness.                                                         The design for the Cryptex is not by Leonardo.                                                                                                                                                                 The Cryptex described by Dan Brown is a little combination-lock strongbox for documents. It consists of a series of 5 rings set into a cylinder with a plug at the end. Each ring has a cut corresponding to a letter inscribed on the outside.                                       If the rings are rotated so that the cuts/grooves are lined up, then the way is clear for the plug to be removed completely, revealing the contents of the hollow cylinder.

And the one after that. And after that. And then, even more.         Above: The Sopranos Last Supper for Vanity Fair magazine Whenever I see popular blog posts and online articles about something in pop culture that references something historical, I always wonder if the ... ahem,  younger  generations know the origin of the original and how many other interpretations had been created prior to the one they tweeted, tagged, posted on 'digg' or shared on facebook. Such is the case with a link someone sent me of fun parodies based on Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. I'd seen the Soprano's Last Supper photo in Vanity Fair and was familiar with the Legos one, since it had been e-mailed to me a ways back. Along with those, the link included just about every pop culture version you could think of -from the Simpsons to Star Wars. Above: The Last Supper made of Legos This got me wondering if the people viewing it were aware that The Last Supper was a subject for many well known artists from the 14th-20th centuries, not just da Vinci. From Albrecht Durer to Rembrandt, Tintoretto to Blake, the subject was interpreted by almost every painter who painted for money for centuries. Common sense would tell you that, given that biblical scenes and stories dominated the art world long before any other subjects.   But I wondered how many people e-mailing that very link also know that the piece has since been interpreted by the likes of such artists as Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol, Damien Hirst and even photographer David LaChapelle, to name a few. Well, if they didn't, you can e-mail them this post. I'm not going to show you the scads of photoshopped and parody versions out there in cyberspace because so many other bloggers have done that already*. Instead of parodies, I wanted to show you other fine art and photographer's interpretations of Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting. Don't groan... you may just learn something.

clueweb09-enwp00-88-21939	"                     Indigenous Australian art          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (November 2007)              Aboriginal hollowed log coffin       Indigenous Australian art  is art produced by  Indigenous Australians , covering works that pre-date  European colonization  as well as  contemporary art  by  Aboriginal Australians  based on traditional culture.   These have been studied in recent decades and gained increased international recognition. [ 1 ]  Aboriginal Art covers a wide medium including painting on leaves, wood carving, rock carving, sculpture,  sandpainting  and ceremonial clothing, as well as artistic decorations found on weaponry and also tools.   Art is one of the key rituals of Aboriginal culture and was and still is, used to mark territory, record history, and tell stories about the  dreamtime . Similar to how Christians have their own story of the creation of the Earth, the Dreamtime is how the Aboriginals believed the world was created.   But the importance of art to traditional Indigenous life is difficult for non-Indigenous people to understand. To quote  Howard Morphy  (1991): ""Art was, and is, a central component of the traditional  Yolngu  way of life, of significance in the political domain, in the relationships between clans, and in the relations between men and women. Art was and remains an important component of the system of restricted knowledge, and at a more metaphysical level is the major means of recreating ancestral events, ensuring continuity with the ancestral past, and communicating with the spirit world. For example, a rock painting of a  Rainbow Serpent  is not just a picture of a 'Rainbow Serpent'. It is a manifestation of the  Rainbow Serpent  - she resides in the painting, and will come out and devour you if you behave inappropriately towards the painting.   To quote Morphy (1991) again: ""Paintings as ancestral designs do not simply represent the ancestral beings by encoding stories... As far as the  Yolngu  are concerned, the designs are an integral part of the ancestral beings themselves... The designs themselves possess or contain the power of the ancestral being.""

For example, the  Yolngu  people of  Arnhem Land  cover their bodies in elaborate and exquisite designs to ceremonies or traditional dances. The preparation can take many hours, and the finest artists will be sought after for this. The designs drawn on the body are traditional designs, often involving fine cross-hatching and lines of dots, which are owned by the  clan  of the person who is being decorated.   Body painting is thought to have been the inspiration for many of the designs now found in Bark Painting.     [ edit ]   Rock painting          Aboriginal rock painting at  Namadgi National Park  featuring a  Kangaroo ,  Dingoes ,  Emus ,  Humans  and an  Echidna  or  Turtle       Indigenous art includes a range of styles of rock painting:     The cross-hatch or  X-ray  art  from the  Arnhem Land  and  Kakadu  regions of the  Northern Territory , in which the  skeletons  and  viscera  of the animals and humans portrayed are drawn inside the outline, as if by  cross section .   Dot-painting  where intricate  patterns ,  totems  and/or stories are created using dots; and   Stencil art, particularly using the motif of a hand print.             Wiradjuri  painting of Baiame, near  Singleton , NSW. Note that his arms extend to the two trees either side.       More simple designs of straight lines, circles and spirals, are also common, and in many cases are thought to be the origins of some forms of contemporary Aboriginal Art.   A particular type of Aboriginal painting, known as the  Bradshaws , appears on caves in the  Kimberley region of Western Australia . They are named after the European pastoralist, Joseph Bradshaw, who first reported them in 1891. To Aboriginal people of the region they are known as Gwion Gwion. Traditional Aboriginal art is composed of organic colours and materials, but modern artists often use synthetic paints when creating aboriginal styles.   Aboriginal rock art has been created for a long period of time, with the oldest examples, in West Australia's Pilbara region, and the Olary district of South Australia, estimated to be up to around 40,000 years old. [ 2 ]  Rock art gives us descriptive information about social activities, material culture, economy, environmental change, myth and religion.     [ edit ]   Bark painting   Main article:  Bark Painting   Bark paintings are paintings made by Australian Indigenous artists on pieces of flattened bark taken from trees such as the  stringybark . The designs seen on authentic bark paintings are traditional designs that are owned by the artist, or his or her ""skin"", or clan, and cannot be painted by other artists. While the designs themselves are ancient, the means of painting them on a piece of flattened bark is a relatively modern phenomenon, although there is some evidence that artists would paint designs on the bark walls and roofs of their shelters.   Bark paintings are now regarded as ""Fine Art"", and the finest bark paintings command high prices accordingly on the international art markets. The very best artists are recognized annually in the  National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award .  Bark painting is also quite popular in some countries.     [ edit ]   Aerial desert ""country"" landscapes   From ancient times, Australian aboriginal culture also produced a genre of  aerial landscape art , often titled simply ""country"". It is a kind of  maplike ,  bird's-eye view  of the desert  landscape , and it is often meant to tell a traditional  Dreaming  story. In the distant past, the common media for such artwork were rock, sand or  body painting ; but the tradition continues today in the form of paintings on canvas (see section  Papunya Tula and ""Dot Painting""  below).     [ edit ]   Rock engravings          Engravings at  Terrey Hills , near Sydney, NSW. The two kangaroos suggest this was used for an  increase ceremony , whilst the  well-endowed  man may be  Baiame . More details are in  Sydney Rock Engravings .       There are several different types of  Rock art  across Australia, the most famous of which is  Murujuga  in  Western Australia , the  Sydney Rock Engravings  around  Sydney  in  New South Wales , and the  Panaramitee  rock art in  Central Australia .   The rock art at Murujuga is said to be the world's largest collection of  petroglyphs  and includes images of extinct animals such as  Thylacine . Activity prior to the last ice age until  colonisation  are recorded.   The  Sydney Rock Art  has its own peculiar style, not found elsewhere in Australia, with beautiful carved animals, humans, and symbolism.     [ edit ]   Stone arrangements   Stone arrangements in Australia range from the 50m-diameter circles of  Victoria , with 1m-high stones firmly embedded in the ground, to the smaller stone arrangements found throughout Australia, such as those near  Yirrkala  which depict accurate images of the  praus  used by  Macassan   Trepang  fishermen.   See  Aboriginal stone arrangements  for more details.     [ edit ]   Carvings and sculpture     Carved shells -  Riji   Mimih  (or Mimi) small man-like carvings of mythological  impish  creatures. Mimihs are so frail that they never venture out on windy days lest they be swept away like leaf litter. If approached by men they will run into a rock crevice, if no crevice is there, the rocks themselves will open up and seal behind the Mimih.   Necklaces and other  jewellery , such as those from the  Tasmanian Aborigines       [ edit ]   Weaving and string-art     Basket weaving- see  Australian Aboriginal fibrecraft       [ edit ]   Iconography and symbols   The imagery of the Aboriginal culture, as can be seen in many of the sacred sites, rock and cave paintings, used few colours as they were often made from what was available locally. Some colours were mined from ochre pits, being used for both painting and ceremonies, with ochre also traded between clans and at one time could only be collected by specific men within the clan. Other pigments were made from clay, wood ash or animal blood. There were variations in the symbolic representation of some rock art and paintings, depending on the tribe or region of Australia that you belong to, which is still evident today in the modern art work of Aboriginal artists. The dotted motifs of much of today's Aboriginal modern design work has become the trademark of the contemporary Aboriginal Art movement. Its iconic status developed from a culture stretching back into the history of an ancient land, evolving and weaving into desert dreamtime stories.   Certain symbols within the Aboriginal modern art movement retain the same meaning across regions, although the meaning of the same symbols may change within the context of the whole painting. When viewed in monochrome other symbols can look similar, such as the circles within circles, sometimes depicted on their own, sparsely or in clustered groups. When this symbol is used and depending on the Aboriginal tribe you belong to, it can vary in meaning from campfire, tree, hill, digging hole, waterhole or spring. Use of the symbol can be clarified further by the use of colour, such as water being depicted in blue or black.   Many paintings by Aboriginal artists, such as those that represent a 'dreamtime story', are shown from an aerial perspective. The narrative follows the lie of the land, as created by ancestral beings in their journey or during creation. The modern day rendition is a reinterpretation of songs, ceremonies, rock art and body art that was the norm for many thousands of years.   Whatever the meaning, interpretations of the icons should be taken in context of the entire painting, the region from which the artist originates, the story behind the painting, the style of the painting, with additional clues being the colours used in some of the more modern works, such as blue circles signifying water.(Source:  Aboriginal Symbols - Indigenous Australia ) [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Religious and cultural aspects of Aboriginal art          Aboriginal art at  Uluru       Traditional Aboriginal art almost always has a mythological undertone relating to the  Dreamtime  of Australian Aborigines. Many modern purists will say if it doesn't contain the spirituality of Aborigines, it is not true Aboriginal art. [ citation needed ]   Wenten Rubuntja , an Aboriginal landscape artist says it's hard to find any art that is devoid of spiritual meaning;     ""Doesn't matter what sort of painting we do in this country, it still belongs to the people, all the people. This is worship, work, culture. It's all  Dreaming . There are two ways of painting. Both ways are important, because that's culture."" - source  The Weekend Australian Magazine , April, 2002            Aboriginal art showing  Barramundi  fish       Story telling and totem representation feature prominently in all forms of Aboriginal artwork. Additionally the female form, particularly the female  womb  in X-ray style features prominently in some famous sites in  Arnhem Land .    [ edit ]   Graffiti and other destructive influences   Many culturally significant sites of Aboriginal rock paintings have been gradually desecrated and destroyed by encroachment of early settlers and modern-day visitors. This includes the destruction of art by clearing and construction work,  erosion  caused by excessive touching of sites, and graffiti. Many sites now belonging to National Parks have to be strictly monitored by rangers, or closed off to the public permanently. Also recently there have been animals which have gathered some of the rocks to use in nests.     [ edit ]   Contemporary Indigenous art     [ edit ]   Modern Aboriginal artists          Art work by Richard Bell       In 1934 Australian painter Rex Batterbee taught Aboriginal artist  Albert Namatjira  western style watercolour landscape painting, along with other Aboriginal artists at the  Hermannsburg  mission in the  Northern Territory . It became a popular style, known as the  Hermannsburg School , and sold out when the paintings were exhibited in Melbourne, Adelaide and other Australian cities. Namatjira became the first Aboriginal Australian citizen, as a result of his fame and popularity with these watercolour paintings.   In 1966, one of  David Malangi 's designs was produced on the Australian one dollar note, originally without his knowledge. The subsequent payment to him by the Reserve Bank marked the first case of Aboriginal copyright in  Australian copyright law .   In 1988 an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander memorial was unveiled at the  National Gallery of Australia  in  Canberra  made from 200 hollow log coffins, which are similar to the type used for mortuary ceremonies in  Arnhem Land . It was made for the bicentenary of Australia's colonisation, and is in remembrance of Aboriginal people who had died protecting their land during conflict with settlers. It was created by 43 artists from  Ramingining  and communities nearby. The path running through the middle of it represents the Glyde River.   In that same year, the new  Parliament House  in Canberra opened with a forecourt featuring a design by  Michael Nelson Tjakamarra , laid as a mosaic.   The late  Rover Thomas  is another well known modern Australian Aboriginal artist. Born in  Western Australia , he represented Australia in the  Venice Biennale  of 1991. He knew and encouraged other now well-known artists to paint, including  Queenie McKenzie  from the East  Kimberley  / Warmun region, as well as having a strong influence on the works of  Paddy Bedford  and  Freddy Timms .   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the work of  Emily Kngwarreye  became very popular. Although she had been involved in craftwork for most of her life, it was only when she was in her 80s that she was recognised as a painter. She was from the  Utopia community  north east of  Alice Springs . Kngwarreye painted for only a few years near the end of her life. Her styles, which changed every year, have been seen as a mixture of traditional Aboriginal and contemporary Australian. Her rise in popularity has prefigured that of many Indigenous artists from central, northern and western Australia, such as Kngwarreye's niece  Kathleen Petyarre ,  Minnie Pwerle ,  Dorothy Napangardi , Jeannie Petyarre ( Pitjara ) and dozens of others, all of whose works have become highly sought-after. The popularity of these often elderly artists, and the resulting pressure placed upon them and their health, has become such an issue that some art centers have stopped selling these artists' paintings online, instead placing prospective clients on a waiting list for work. [ 4 ]   Despite concerns about supply and demand for paintings, the remoteness of many of the artists, and the poverty and health issues experienced in the communities, there are widespread estimates of an industry worth close to half a billion dollars (Aus) and growing rapidly. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Papunya Tula  and ""dot painting""   Main article:  Papunya Tula   In 19711972, art teacher  Geoffrey Bardon  encouraged Aboriginal people in  Papunya , north west of  Alice Springs  to put their  Dreamings  onto canvas. These stories had previously been drawn on the  desert  sand, and were now given a more permanent form.   The dots were used to cover secret-sacred ceremonies. Originally, the Tula] artists succeeded in forming their own company with an Aboriginal Name:  Papunya Tula  Artists Pty Ltd...however a time of disillusionment followed as artists were criticised by their peers for having revealed too much of their sacred heritage. Secret designs restricted to a ritual context were now in the market place, made visible to Australian Aboriginal painting. Much of the Aboriginal art on display in tourist shops traces back to this style developed at  Papunya . The most famous of the artists to come from this movement was  Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri . Also from this movement is  Johnny Warangkula , whose  Water Dreaming at Kalipinya  twice sold at a record price, the second time being $486,500 in 2000.   In 1983, some members of the Papunya movement, unhappy with the way their paintings were sold to private dealers, moved to  Yuendumu  and began painting 36 doors at the school there with their Dreaming stories, which started an art movement there. In 1985 the Warlukurlangu Artists Aboriginal Association was founded at Yuendumu, which co-ordinates the artists in the area. Some of the best-known painters from this movement include  Paddy Japaljarri Stewart , Paddy Tjapaltjarri Sims, Maggie Napangardi Watson and Judy Napangardi Watson.     [ edit ]   Exploitation of artists   There have been cases of some exploitative dealers (known as carpetbaggers) that have sought to profit from the success of the Aboriginal art movements. Since Geoffrey Bardon's time and in the early years of the Papunya movement, there has been concerns about the exploitation of the largely illiterate and non-English speaking artists.   One of the main reasons the Yuendumu movement was established, and later flourished, was due to the feeling of exploitation amongst artists:     ""Many of the artists who played crucial roles in the founding of the art centre were aware of the increasing interest in Aboriginal art during the 1970s and had watched with concern and curiosity the developments of the art movement at Papunya amongst people to whom they were closely related. There was also a growing private market for Aboriginal art in Alice Springs. Artists' experiences of the private market were marked by feelings of frustration and a sense of disempowerment when buyers refused to pay prices which reflected the value of the Jukurrpa or showed little interest in understanding the story. The establishment of Warlukurlangu was one way of ensuring the artists had some control over the purchase and distribution of their paintings."" (Source:  Warlukurlangu Artists )     Other cases of exploitation include:     painting for a lemon (car): ""Artists have come to me and pulled out photos of cars with mobile phone numbers on the back. They're asked to paint 10-15 canvasses in exchange for a car. When the 'Toyotas' materalise, they often arrive with a flat tyre, no spares, no jack, no fuel."" (Coslovich 2003)       preying on a sick artist: ""Even coming to town for medical treatment, such as dialysis, can make an artist easy prey for dealers wanting to make a quick profit who congregate in Alice Springs"" (op.cit.)       pursuing a famous artist: ""The late (great)  Emily Kngwarreye ...was relentlessly pursued by carpetbaggers towards the end of her career and produced a large but inconsistent body of work."" According to Sotheby's ""We take about one in every 20 paintings of hers, and with those we look for provenance we can be 100% sure of."" (op.cit.)     In March 2006, the ABC reported art fraud had hit the Western Australian Aboriginal Art movements. Allegations were made of sweatshop-like conditions, fake works by English backpackers, overpricing and artists posing for photographs for artwork that wasn't theirs. A detective on the case said:     ""People are clearly taking advantage...Especially the elderly people. I mean, these are people that, they're not educated; they haven't had a lot of contact with white people. They've got no real basic understanding, you know, of the law and even business law. Obviously they've got no real business sense. A dollar doesn't really have much of a meaning to them, and I think to treat anybody like that is just it's just not on in this country."" Call for ACCC to investigate Aboriginal Art industry , ABC PM,  March 15 .       [ edit ]   Australian Senate Inquiry into Australia's Indigenous Visual Arts and Craft Sector   In August 2006, following concerns raised about unethical practices in the Indigneous art sector, the Australian Senate initiated an  inquiry  into issues in the sector. Its terms of reference were:     Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector, with particular reference to:     the current size and scale of Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector;   the economic, social and cultural benefits of the sector;   the overall financial, cultural and artistic sustainability of the sector;   the current and likely future priority infrastructure needs of the sector;   opportunities for strategies and mechanisms that the sector could adopt to improve its practices, capacity and sustainability, including to deal with unscrupulous or unethical conduct;   opportunities for existing government support programs for Indigenous visual arts and crafts to be more effectively targeted to improve the sector's capacity and future sustainability; and   future opportunities for further growth of Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector, including through further developing international markets.       The inquiry was conducted over ten months, gathering evidence from around the country, including public hearings in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Sydney and Canberra. In February 2007, the Senate inquiry heard from the Northern Territory Art Minister,  Marion Scrymgour , that backpackers were often the artists of Aboriginal art being sold in tourist shops around Australia. Of particular concern was the art on didgeridoos:     ""The material they call Aboriginal art is almost exclusively the work of fakers, forgers and fraudsters. Their work hides behind false descriptions and dubious designs. The overwhelming majority of the ones you see in shops throughout the country, not to mention Darling, are fanks pure and simple. There is some anecdotal evidence here in Darwin at least, they have been painted by backpackers working on industrial scale wood production."" Sydney Morning Herald (2007) Backpackers fake Aboriginal art, Senate told     The inquiry's  final report , handed down on  21 June   2007 , made 29 recommendations, including:     greater public funding for infrastructure in the sector   more intensive policing efforts to try and eliminate unethical business practices   adoption of a code of practice across the sector   government agencies and collecting institutions to implement a code when dealing with Indigenous visual art     The report also raised the prospect of law reforms if necessary to change the way the industry was regulated.     [ edit ]   Aboriginal art movements and cooperatives   Main article:  List of Australian Indigenous art movements and cooperatives   Australian Indigenous art momvements and cooperatives have been central to the emergence of Indigenous Australian art. Whereas many western artists pursue formal training and work as individuals, most contemporary Indigenous art is created in community groups and art centres. [ 6 ]   Many of the centres operate online art galleries where local and international visitors can purchase works directly from the communities without the need of going through an intermediary. The cooperatives reflect the diversity of art across indigenous Australia from the north west region where ochre is significantly used; to the tropical north where the use of cross-hatching prevails; to the Papunya style of art from the central desert cooperatives. Art is increasingly becoming a significant source of income and livelihood for some of these communities.

Depictions of elegant human figures, richly hued animals, and figures combining human and animal features—called  therianthropes  and associated with shamanism—continue to inspire admiration for their sophistication, energy, and direct, powerful forms. The apparent universality of these images is deceptive; content and style range widely over the African continent. Nevertheless, African rock art can be divided into three broad geographical zones— southern ,  central , and  northern . The art of each of these zones is distinctive and easily recognizable, even to an untrained eye.     Not all rock art in these three zones is prehistoric; in some areas these arts flourished into the late nineteenth century, while in other areas rock art continues to be made today. In the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa, a number of rock paintings depict clashes between San (Bushmen) people and European colonists mounted on horses and armed with rifles. Many of the Drakensberg works use subtle polychrome shading that gives their subjects a hint of three-dimensional presence. The product of many authors, time periods, and cultures, the flowing naturalism and lively sense of movement of the best rock art attests to the conviction of masterful hands and trained eyes.

Image courtesy of the South African Museum, Cape Town.  This rock painting was extricated from a shelter in the Drakensberg Mountains and currently resides in the South African Museum, Cape Town. Its images of antelopes and humans have been interpreted as evocations of Khoisan trance experiences. Beautifully rendered in subtle tones of red and white, this is among the most famous South African rock paintings. Although its date of execution is not known, it is estimated to have been painted sometime during the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries  A.D.

clueweb09-en0002-47-07116	"                     Indigenous Australian art          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (November 2007)              Aboriginal hollowed log coffin       Indigenous Australian art  is art produced by  Indigenous Australians , covering works that pre-date  European colonization  as well as  contemporary art  by  Aboriginal Australians  based on traditional culture.   It has a history which covers over 30,000 years, and represents a large range of native traditions and styles. These have been studied in recent decades and gained increased international recognition. [ 1 ]  Aboriginal Art covers a wide medium including painting on leaves, wood carving, rock carving, sculpture,  sandpainting  and ceremonial clothing, as well as artistic embellishments found on weaponry and also tools.   Art is one of the key rituals of Aboriginal culture and was and still is, used to mark territory, record history, and tell stories about the  dreamtime . Similar to how Christians have their own story of the creation of the Earth, the Dreamtime is how the Aboriginals believed the world was created.   But the importance of art to traditional Indigenous life is difficult for non-Indigenous people to understand. To quote  Howard Morphy  (1991): ""Art was, and is, a central component of the traditional  Yolngu  way of life, of significance in the political domain, in the relationships between clans, and in the relations between men and women. Art was and remains an important component of the system of restricted knowledge, and at a more metaphysical level is the major means of recreating ancestral events, ensuring continuity with the ancestral past, and communicating with the spirit world. For example, a rock painting of a  Rainbow Serpent  is not just a picture of a 'Rainbow Serpent'. It is a manifestation of the  Rainbow Serpent  - she resides in the painting, and will come out and devour you if you behave inappropriately towards the painting.   To quote Morphy (1991) again: ""Paintings as ancestral designs do not simply represent the ancestral beings by encoding stories... As far as the  Yolngu  are concerned, the designs are an integral part of the ancestral beings themselves... The designs themselves possess or contain the power of the ancestral being.""

For example, the  Yolngu  people of  Arnhem Land  cover their bodies in elaborate and exquisite john to ceremonies or traditional dances. The preparation can take many hours, and the finest artists will be sought after for this. The designs drawn on the body are traditional designs, often involving fine cross-hatching and lines of dots, which are owned by the  clan  of the person who is being decorated.   Body painting is thought to have been the inspiration for many of the designs now found in Bark Painting.     [ edit ]   Rock Painting          Aboriginal rock painting at  Namadgi National Park  featuring a  Kangaroo ,  Dingoes ,  Emus ,  Humans  and an  Echidna  or  Turtle               Wiradjuri  painting of Baiame, near  Singleton , NSW. Note that his arms extend to the two trees either side.              Rock art in  Carnarvon Gorge       Rock painting  can be found in most parts of  Australia , ranging from simple hand or boomerang stencils to elaborate X-ray pictures.   Traditionally, paints were often made from water, animal fats or  spittle  mixed with ochre and other rock pigments and sometimes had vegetable fibers added. Painting was then performed on people's bodies, rock walls or bark (particular that of the  paperbark   gum ). Tools used included primitive  brushes ,  sticks , fingers and even a technique of spraying the paint directly out of the mouth onto the medium resulting in an effect similar to modern  spraypaint . Aboriginal Art can be made up of a series of dots, lines, or just the outline of a shape.   There are a wide variety of styles of Aboriginal art. Three common types are     The cross-hatch or  X-ray  art  from the  Arnhem Land  and  Kakadu  regions of the  Northern Territory , in which the  skeletons  and  viscera  of the animals and humans portrayed are drawn inside the outline, as if by  cross section ;       Dot-painting  where intricate  patterns ,  totems  and/or stories are created using dots; and       Stencil art, particularly using the motif of a hand print.     More simple designs of straight lines, circles and spirals, are also common, and in many cases are thought to be the origins of some forms of contemporary Aboriginal Art.   A particular type of Aboriginal painting, known as the  Bradshaws , appears on caves in the  Kimberley region of Western Australia . They are named after the European pastoralist, Joseph Bradshaw, who first reported them in 1891. To Aboriginal people of the region they are known as Gwion Gwion. Traditional Aboriginal art is composed of organic colours and materials, but modern artists often use synthetic paints when creating aboriginal styles.   Aboriginal art involves story telling, myths, rituals, sorcery and magic.   Aboriginal rock art has been created for a long period of time, with the oldest examples, in West Australia's Pilbara region, and the Olary district of South Australia, estimated to be up to around 40,000 years old. [ 2 ]  Rock art gives us descriptive information about social activities, material culture, economy, environmental change, myth and religion.     [ edit ]   Bark painting       Main article:  Bark Painting       Bark paintings are paintings made by Australian Indigenous artists on pieces of flattened bark taken from trees such as the  stringybark . The designs seen on authentic bark paintings are traditional designs that are owned by the artist, or his or her ""skin"", or clan, and cannot be painted by other artists. While the designs themselves are ancient, the means of painting them on a piece of flattened bark is a relatively modern phenomenon, although there is some evidence that artists would paint designs on the bark walls and roofs of their shelters.   Bark paintings are now regarded as ""Fine Art"", and the finest bark paintings command high prices accordingly on the international art markets. The very best artists are recognized annually in the  National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award .  Bark painting is also quite popular in some countries.     [ edit ]   Aerial desert ""country"" landscapes   From ancient times, Australian aboriginal culture also produced a genre of  aerial landscape art , often titled simply ""country"". It is a kind of  maplike ,  bird's-eye view  of the desert  landscape , and it is often meant to tell a traditional  Dreaming  story. In the distant past, the common media for such artwork were rock, sand or  body painting ; but the tradition continues today in the form of paintings on canvas (see section  Papunya Tula and ""Dot Painting""  below).     [ edit ]   Rock Engravings          Engravings at  Terrey Hills , near Sydney, NSW. The two kangaroos suggest this was used for an  increase ceremony , whilst the well-endowed man may be  Baiame . More details are in  Sydney Rock Engravings .       There are several different types of  Rock art  across Australia, the most famous of which is  Murujuga  in  Western Australia , the  Sydney Rock Engravings  around  Sydney  in  New South Wales , and the  Panaramitee  rock art in  Central Australia .   The rock art at Murujuga is said to be the world's largest collection of  petroglyphs  and includes images of extinct animals such as  Thylacine . Activity prior to the last ice age until  colonisation  are recorded.   The  Sydney Rock Art  has its own peculiar style, not found elsewhere in Australia, with beautiful carved animals, humans, and symbolism.     [ edit ]   Stone Arrangements   Stone arrangements in Australia range from the 50m-diameter circles of  Victoria , with 1m-high stones firmly embedded in the ground, to the smaller stone arrangements found throughout Australia, such as those near  Yirrkala  which depict accurate images of the  praus  used by  Macassan   Trepang  fishermen.   See  Aboriginal stone arrangements  for more details.     [ edit ]   Carvings and sculpture     Carved shells -  Riji   Mimih  (or Mimi) small man-like carvings of mythological  impish  creatures. Mimihs are so frail that they never venture out on windy days lest they be swept away like leaf litter. If approached by men they will run into a rock crevice, if no crevice is there, the rocks themselves will open up and seal behind the Mimih.   Necklaces and other  jewellery , such as those from the  Tasmanian Aborigines       [ edit ]   Weaving and String-Art     Basket weaving- see  Australian Aboriginal fibrecraft       [ edit ]   Iconography and Symbols   The imagery of the Aboriginal culture, as can be seen in many of the sacred sites, rock and cave paintings, used few colours as they were often made from what was available locally. Some colours were mined from ochre pits, being used for both painting and ceremonies, with ochre also traded between clans and at one time could only be collected by specific men within the clan. Other pigments were made from clay, wood ash or animal blood. There were variations in the symbolic representation of some rock art and paintings, depending on the tribe or region of Australia that you belong to, which is still evident today in the modern art work of Aboriginal artists. The dotted motifs of much of today's Aboriginal modern design work has become the trademark of the contemporary Aboriginal Art movement. Its iconic status developed from a culture stretching back into the history of an ancient land, evolving and weaving into desert dreamtime stories.   Certain symbols within the Aboriginal modern art movement retain the same meaning across regions, although the meaning of the same symbols may change within the context of the whole painting. When viewed in monochrome other symbols can look similar, such as the circles within circles, sometimes depicted on their own, sparsely or in clustered groups. When this symbol is used and depending on the Aboriginal tribe you belong to, it can vary in meaning from campfire, tree, hill, digging hole, waterhole or spring. Use of the symbol can be clarified further by the use of colour, such as water being depicted in blue or black.   Many paintings by Aboriginal artists, such as those that represent a 'dreamtime story', are shown from an aerial perspective. The narrative follows the lie of the land, as created by ancestral beings in their journey or during creation. The modern day rendition is a reinterpretation of songs, ceremonies, rock art and body art that was the norm for many thousands of years.   Whatever the meaning, interpretations of the icons should be taken in context of the entire painting, the region from which the artist originates, the story behind the painting, the style of the painting, with additional clues being the colours used in some of the more modern works, such as blue circles signifying water.(Source:  Aboriginal Symbols - Indigenous Australia ) [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Religious and cultural aspects of Aboriginal art          Aboriginal art at  Uluru       Traditional Aboriginal art almost always has a mythological undertone relating to the  Dreamtime  of Australian Aborigines. Many modern purists will say if it doesn't contain the spirituality of Aborigines, it is not true Aboriginal art. [ citation needed ]   Wenten Rubuntja , an Aboriginal landscape artist says it's hard to find any art that is devoid of spiritual meaning;     ""Doesn't matter what sort of painting we do in this country, it still belongs to the people, all the people. This is worship, work, culture. It's all  Dreaming . There are two ways of painting. Both ways are important, because that's culture."" - source  The Weekend Australian Magazine , April, 2002            Aboriginal art showing  Barramundi  fish       Story telling and totem representation feature prominently in all forms of Aboriginal artwork. Additionally the female form, particularly the female  womb  in X-ray style features prominently in some famous sites in  Arnhem Land .    [ edit ]   Graffiti and other destructive influences   Many culturally significant sites of Aboriginal rock paintings have been gradually desecrated and destroyed by encroachment of early settlers and modern-day visitors. This includes the destruction of art by clearing and construction work,  erosion  caused by excessive touching of sites, and graffiti. Many sites now belonging to National Parks have to be strictly monitored by rangers, or closed off to the public permanently. Also recently there have been animals which have gathered some of the rocks to use in nests.     [ edit ]   Contemporary Indigenous Art     [ edit ]   Modern Aboriginal Artists          Art work by Richard Bell       In 1934 Australian painter Rex Batterbee taught Aboriginal artist  Albert Namatjira  western style watercolour landscape painting, along with other Aboriginal artists at the  Hermannsburg  mission in the  Northern Territory . It became a popular style, known as the  Hermannsburg School , and sold out when the paintings were exhibited in Melbourne, Adelaide and other Australian cities. Namatjira became the first Aboriginal Australian citizen, as a result of his fame and popularity with these watercolour paintings.   In 1966, one of  David Malangi 's designs was produced on the Australian one dollar note, originally without his knowledge. The subsequent payment to him by the Reserve Bank marked the first case of Aboriginal copyright in  Australian copyright law .   In 1988 an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander memorial was unveiled at the  National Gallery of Australia  in  Canberra  made from 200 hollow log coffins, which are similar to the type used for mortuary ceremonies in  Arnhem Land . It was made for the bicentenary of Australia's colonisation, and is in remembrance of Aboriginal people who had died protecting their land during conflict with settlers. It was created by 43 artists from  Ramingining  and communities nearby. The path running through the middle of it represents the Glyde River.   In that same year, the new  Parliament House  in Canberra opened with a forecourt featuring a design by  Michael Nelson Tjakamarra , laid as a mosaic.   The late  Rover Thomas  is another well known modern Australian Aboriginal artist. Born in  Western Australia , he represented Australia in the  Venice Biennale  of 1991. He knew and encouraged other now well-known artists to paint, including  Queenie McKenzie  from the East  Kimberley  / Warmun region, as well as having a strong influence on the works of  Paddy Bedford  and  Freddy Timms .   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the work of  Emily Kngwarreye  became very popular. Although she had been involved in craftwork for most of her life, it was only when she was in her 80s that she was recognised as a painter. She was from the  Utopia community  north east of  Alice Springs . Kngwarreye painted for only a few years near the end of her life. Her styles, which changed every year, have been seen as a mixture of traditional Aboriginal and contemporary Australian. Her rise in popularity has prefigured that of many Indigenous artists from central, northern and western Australia, such as Kngwarreye's niece  Kathleen Petyarre ,  Minnie Pwerle ,  Dorothy Napangardi , Jeannie Petyarre ( Pitjara ) and dozens of others, all of whose works have become highly sought-after. The popularity of these often elderly artists, and the resulting pressure placed upon them and their health, has become such an issue that some art centers have stopped selling these artists' paintings online, instead placing prospective clients on a waiting list for work. [ 4 ]   Despite concerns about supply and demand for paintings, the remoteness of many of the artists, and the poverty and health issues experienced in the communities, there are widespread estimates of an industry worth close to half a billion dollars (Aus) and growing rapidly. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Papunya Tula  and ""Dot Painting""       Main article:  Papunya Tula       In 19711972, art teacher  Geoffrey Bardon  encouraged Aboriginal people in  Papunya , north west of  Alice Springs  to put their  Dreamings  onto canvas. These stories had previously been drawn on the  desert  sand, and were now given a more permanent form.   The dots were used to cover secret-sacred ceremonies. Originally, the paintings were used in addition to the oral history of Aboriginal  dreamings  and so they were made for cultural purposes and not the art market. The dots are, in effect, a form of camouflage:     ""In 1972, the [Papunya Tula] artists succeeded in forming their own company with an Aboriginal Name:  Papunya Tula  Artists Pty Ltd...however a time of disillusionment followed as artists were criticised by their peers for having revealed too much of their sacred heritage. Secret designs restricted to a ritual context were now in the market place, made visible to kardiya outsiders and Aboriginal women. In response to these objections, all detailed depictions of human figures, fully decorated tjurungas (bullroarers) and ceremonial paraphernalia were removed or modified. Such designs and their 'inside' meanings were not to be written down and 'traded'. Any contravention broke the immutable plan of descent, the link of the initiated men with his totemic ancestor through his father and his father's father. From 1973 to 1975, Papunya Tula artists sought to camouflage overt references to ceremony and became reticent. They revealed less of the sacred heart of their culture. The openness of the Bardon era was at an end. Dotting and over-dotting, as an ideal means of concealing or painting over dangerous, secret designs, became a fashion at this stage. The art was made public, watered down for general exhibition, pointing to the uniqueness of the  Geoffrey Bardon  years - which like innocence, cannot be rediscovered."" (Judith Ryan in Bardon 1991: ix-x)     Eventually the style, known as the  Papunya Tula  school, or sometimes popularly as 'dot art', became the most recognisable form of Australian Aboriginal painting. Much of the Aboriginal art on display in tourist shops traces back to this style developed at  Papunya . The most famous of the artists to come from this movement was  Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri . Also from this movement is  Johnny Warangkula , whose  Water Dreaming at Kalipinya  twice sold at a record price, the second time being $486,500 in 2000.   In 1983, some members of the Papunya movement, unhappy with the way their paintings were sold to private dealers, moved to  Yuendumu  and began painting 36 doors at the school there with their Dreaming stories, which started an art movement there. In 1985 the Warlukurlangu Artists Aboriginal Association was founded at Yuendumu, which co-ordinates the artists in the area. Some of the best-known painters from this movement include  Paddy Japaljarri Stewart , Paddy Tjapaltjarri Sims, Maggie Napangardi Watson and Judy Napangardi Watson.     [ edit ]   Exploitation of Artists   There have been cases of some exploitative dealers (known as carpetbaggers) that have sought to profit from the success of the Aboriginal art movements. Since Geoffrey Bardon's time and in the early years of the Papunya movement, there has been concerns about the exploitation of the largely illiterate and non-English speaking artists.   One of the main reasons the Yuendumu movement was established, and later flourished, was due to the feeling of exploitation amongst artists:     ""Many of the artists who played crucial roles in the founding of the art centre were aware of the increasing interest in Aboriginal art during the 1970s and had watched with concern and curiosity the developments of the art movement at Papunya amongst people to whom they were closely related. There was also a growing private market for Aboriginal art in Alice Springs. Artists' experiences of the private market were marked by feelings of frustration and a sense of disempowerment when buyers refused to pay prices which reflected the value of the Jukurrpa or showed little interest in understanding the story. The establishment of Warlukurlangu was one way of ensuring the artists had some control over the purchase and distribution of their paintings."" (Source:  Warlukurlangu Artists )     Other cases of exploitation include:     painting for a lemon (car): ""Artists have come to me and pulled out photos of cars with mobile phone numbers on the back. They're asked to paint 10-15 canvasses in exchange for a car. When the 'Toyotas' materalise, they often arrive with a flat tyre, no spares, no jack, no fuel."" (Coslovich 2003)       preying on a sick artist: ""Even coming to town for medical treatment, such as dialysis, can make an artist easy prey for dealers wanting to make a quick profit who congregate in Alice Springs"" (op.cit.)       pursuing a famous artist: ""The late (great)  Emily Kngwarreye ...was relentlessly pursued by carpetbaggers towards the end of her career and produced a large but inconsistent body of work."" According to Sotheby's ""We take about one in every 20 paintings of hers, and with those we look for provenance we can be 100% sure of."" (op.cit.)     In March 2006, the ABC reported art fraud had hit the Western Australian Aboriginal Art movements. Allegations were made of sweatshop-like conditions, fake works by English backpackers, overpricing and artists posing for photographs for artwork that weren't theirs. A detective on the case said:     ""People are clearly taking advantage...Especially the elderly people. I mean, these are people that, they're not educated; they haven't had a lot of contact with white people. They've got no real basic understanding, you know, of the law and even business law. Obviously they've got no real business sense. A dollar doesn't really have much of a meaning to them, and I think to treat anybody like that is just& it's just not on in this country."" Call for ACCC to investigate Aboriginal Art industry , ABC PM,  March 15 .       [ edit ]   Fraud   Fraud can be a problem for high profile artists whose works attract high prices, especially in the secondary market. This has arisen as a problem for Australian Indigenous art, particularly in the last decade.   The late Ginger Riley Munduwalawala (c.1937-2002), a Mara elder from Borroloola in south-east Arnhem Land, revealed in 1999 that he had ""risked his career by revealing he had signed at least 50 forged paintings under duress while drunk."" This admission sparked a brief investigation into Aboriginal art forgeries.  The Age (2002) Ginger Riley, the 'boss of colour', dies     [ edit ]   Australian Senate Inquiry into Australia's Indigenous Visual Arts and Craft Sector   In August 2006, following concerns raised about unethical practices in the Indigneous art sector, the Australian Senate initiated an  inquiry  into issues in the sector. Its terms of reference were:     Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector, with particular reference to:     the current size and scale of Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector;   the economic, social and cultural benefits of the sector;   the overall financial, cultural and artistic sustainability of the sector;   the current and likely future priority infrastructure needs of the sector;   opportunities for strategies and mechanisms that the sector could adopt to improve its practices, capacity and sustainability, including to deal with unscrupulous or unethical conduct;   opportunities for existing government support programs for Indigenous visual arts and crafts to be more effectively targeted to improve the sector's capacity and future sustainability; and   future opportunities for further growth of Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector, including through further developing international markets.       The inquiry was conducted over ten months, gathering evidence from around the country, including public hearings in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Sydney and Canberra. In February 2007, the Senate inquiry heard from the Northern Territory Art Minister,  Marion Scrymgour , that backpackers were often the artists of Aboriginal art being sold in tourist shops around Australia. Of particular concern was the art on didgeridoos:     ""The material they call Aboriginal art is almost exclusively the work of fakers, forgers and fraudsters. Their work hides behind false descriptions and dubious designs. The overwhelming majority of the ones you see in shops throughout the country, not to mention Darling, are fanks pure and simple. There is some anecdotal evidence here in Darwin at least, they have been painted by backpackers working on industrial scale wood production."" Sydney Morning Herald (2007) Backpackers fake Aboriginal art, Senate told     The inquiry's  final report , handed down on  21 June   2007 , made 29 recommendations, including:     greater public funding for infrastructure in the sector   more intensive policing efforts to try and eliminate unethical business practices   adoption of a code of practice across the sector   government agencies and collecting institutions to implement a code when dealing with Indigenous visual art     The report also raised the prospect of law reforms if necessary to change the way the industry was regulated.     [ edit ]   Aboriginal Art Movements and Co-operatives   The following external sites are links to some of the Aboriginal-owned and -operated art cooperatives. Many of these sites contain an online art gallery where local and international visitors can purchase works directly from the communities without the need of going through an intermedilaiary. These cooperatives show the diversity of art across indigenous Australia from the north west region where oscachre is significantly used; to the tropical north where the use of cross-hatching prevails; to the Papunya style of art from the central desert cooperatives. Art is increasingly becoming a significant source of income and livelihood for some of these communities.
