The all-white Football Association of South Africa (FASA), was formed in 1892, while the South African Indian Football Association (SAIFA), the South African Bantu Football Association (SABFA) and the South African Coloured Football Association (SACFA) were founded in 1903, 1933 and 1936 respectively.   South Africa were invited to join  Ethiopia ,  Egypt  and  Sudan  at the first conference of the  Confederation of African Football  in  Khartoum  in 1957 and the South African representative, Fred Fell, sat at the first meeting as a founding member. It soon became clear however that South Africa's constitution prohibited racially mixed teams from competitive sport and so they could only send either an all-black side or an all-white side to the planned  1957 African Cup of Nations . This was unacceptable to the other members of the Confederation and South Africa were disqualified from the competition, however some sources say that they withdrew voluntarily.   At the second CAF conference in 1958 South Africa were formally expelled from CAF. The all-white (FASA) were admitted to FIFA in the same year, but in August 1960 it was given an ultimatum of one year to fall in line with the non-discriminatory regulations of FIFA. On 26 September 1961 at the annual FIFA conference, the South African association was formally suspended from FIFA. Sir  Stanley Rous , president of  The Football Association  of England and a champion of South Africa's FIFA membership, was elected FIFA President a few days later. Rous was adamant that sport, and FIFA in particular, should not embroil itself in political matters and against fierce opposition he continued to resist attempts to expel South Africa from FIFA. The suspension was lifted in January 1963 after a visit to South Africa by Rous in order to investigate the state of football in the country.   Rous declared that if the suspension were not lifted, football there would be discontinued, possibly to the point of no recovery. The next annual conference of FIFA in October 1964 took place in Tokyo and was attended by a larger contingent of representatives from African and Asian associations and here the suspension of South Africa's membership was re-imposed. In 1976, after the  Soweto  uprising, they were formally expelled from FIFA.   In 1991, with the apartheid system beginning to be demolished, a new multiracial South African Football Association was formed. On 7 July 1992, the South African national team played their first game in two decades, beating  Cameroon  1-0. South Africa made the  1998  and  2002   World Cups , but failed to get out of the first round each time. They hosted (and won) the  1996 African Nations Cup  and will host the  2010 World Cup , the first  African  nation to do so.   South Africa failed to impress local supporters by not scoring a single goal in the African Nations Cup of 2006. In light of these poor performances it was decided that the hiring of a more experienced manager was essential. Rumours began to fly, prior to the  2006 , that England coach  Sven-Gran Eriksson  was to be the man for the job, with SAFA apparently offering him R30 million to take Bafana-Bafana to glory in 2010. However this has since been denied. More recently the former Brazil coach  Carlos Alberto Parreira  has accepted the job. After accepting the job, he was awarded R100 million for a four year contract. His term as manager started 1 January 2007 targeting  2010 FIFA World Cup  but he resigned in April 2008 due to family reasons.   Joel Santana  signed to coach until 2010.

It has never qualified for a major international tournament. It came close to qualifying for the 2005  Gold Cup  as it hosted the  Digicel Cup  finals for the Caribbean that acted as Gold Cup qualifiers, but finished fourth of the four teams. In 2001, it surprised many by making the semifinal round of the 2002 World Cup Qualifers. In the first game of this round, they pulled off a shock 2-1 win over  Costa Rica , but lost their five remaining games. In 2004, Barbados draw a shock 1-1 home against  Northern Ireland .   Barbados National Football's most recent successes have been at youth level where their Under-15s were narrowly defeated in the 2007 Caribbean Football Union Under-15' tournament by  El Salvador . Their under 20s recently recorded good results on a tour of Colombia and the  Barbados Under 23s National Football Team  are looking to make progress in the  CONCACAF  regional qualifiers for the  Olympics  in  Beijing .

However, there are problems with this time/reference.  Swimming at the 2006 Commonwealth Games  started on March 16, and the men's 200 free was March 17. Neethling did swim the 200 free at those games; however, he went 1:48.88 in  prelims  and 1:48.78 in  finals , and he did not swim on the  4x200 free relay , all according to the results from OmegaTiming.com. The 1:45.85 by Jean Basson, listed here as the record, is listed by SSA as the  African Record , which should be the Neethling time, if it existed. Therefor it is presumed that the South African Record is 1:45.85 for the moment, and hence listed here as such. The 1:44.88 is being investigated by SSA as of July 2008.   ^  a   b   c   d   e   World Record  when swum.   ^   ""Trott sets new African record in Spain"" .

However, there are problems with this time/reference.  Swimming at the 2006 Commonwealth Games  started on March 16, and the men's 200 free was March 17. Neethling did swim the 200 free at those games; however, he went 1:48.88 in  prelims  and 1:48.78 in  finals , and he did not swim on the  4x200 free relay , all according to the results from OmegaTiming.com. The 1:45.85 by Jean Basson, listed here as the record, is listed by SSA as the  African Record , which should be the Neethling time, if it existed. Therefor it is presumed that the South African Record is 1:45.85 for the moment, and hence listed here as such. The 1:44.88 is being investigated by SSA as of July 2008.   ^  a   b   c   d   e   World Record  when swum.   ^   ""Trott sets new African record in Spain"" .

This is most likely a misreading of the date from complete numerical form: 7-12-01, reading it a month-day-year when presented as day-month-year.
