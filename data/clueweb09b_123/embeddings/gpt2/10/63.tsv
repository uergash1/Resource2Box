It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on February 17, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  February 17 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  February 17 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

It is operated by the  University of North Carolina , with studios located at the UNC Center for Public Television at  Research Triangle Park .   UNC-TV operates eleven transmitters that broadcast across the entire state as well as into parts of  Virginia ,  Tennessee  and  South Carolina . The network includes all  PBS  member stations licensed within North Carolina except for  WTVI  in  Charlotte , which is a community licensee.   It also formerly operated four digital channels:  UNC-KD  (children's programs),  UNC-HD  (high-definition programming),  UNC-NC  (North Carolina public affairs and original local productions) and  UNC-ED  (educational television). Consumers with Time Warner Cable are the only ones capable of receiving all of these digital subchannels, as the company has a direct-fiber optic connection to the broadcast facilities of UNC-TV.   On  September 25th ,  2008 , UNC-TV commenced a revised lineup of three digital subchannels via over-the-air  broadcast television :  UNC-TV  (the main channel now operating as a full-time HD service),  UNC-KD  in SD, and  UNC-NC  in SD.

In the next 12 years, three more stations signed on and a system of  translators  in the mountains allowed the network to reach across the entire state. The network's youngest station, WUNU in  Lumberton , signed on in 1996. The network was known on-air as  North Carolina Public Television  (identified in North Carolina editions of TV Guide as  CPT , an abbreviated form of ""University of North Carolina  C enter for  P ublic  T elevision"") from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, when it began calling itself  University of North Carolina Television . It adopted the shorter name of  UNC-TV  later in the 1990s.   The network creates many programs of local interest, including the  newsmagazine   North Carolina Now , the interview series  North Carolina People  (hosted by former UNC president  William Friday ),  Carolina Outdoor Journal ,  Exploring North Carolina ,  North Carolina Bookwatch  with  D.G. Martin , and special programs about the state's  history  and  culture  (often seen during the network's annual pledge drive). It also creates two programs for national distribution ( The Woodwright's Shop  and  Lap Quilting with Georgia Bonesteel ). In addition to PBS programs, the station also runs British comedies on Saturday nights and  EastEnders  on Sunday nights.

WUND-TV used the callsign WUNB-TV from its 1965 sign-on until 1967.   2. WUND-TV was originally licensed to  Columbia ; the license was moved to Edenton in 2005. ( [1] )   3. Five stations in the Wilmington DMA began transmitting solely in digital starting September 8, 2008. WUNJ-TV opted to continue analog broadcasts until the national switchover on June 12, 2009.   4. WUNW will operate as a digital-only station, with a target date for commencement of operations tenatively scheduled for February 2010.  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]       [ edit ]   Digital television   The network's multiplexed digital signals before September 25, 2008 were:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming       xx.2   UNC-HD (PBS programs in HD)       xx.3   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.4   UNC-ED (educational programming)       xx.5   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming)       Due to bandwidth limitations, the over-the-air version of UNC-HD was only availably between 8-11pm, during which UNC-ED and UNC-NC were off the air. Cable systems with a direct digital link to UNC-TV facilities broadcast all five channels on a 24 hour schedule.   On September 25th, 2008, the over-the-air channel configuration became:       Sub-channel   Programming       xx.1   main UNC-TV/PBS programming in HD       xx.2   UNC-KD  (children's programming)       xx.3   UNC-NC (North Carolina-centric programming) [ 4 ]       UNC-HD and UNC-ED are currently available only through cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV. Systems dependent on over-the-air reception now carry the three channel lineup.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Analog-to-digital conversion   After the  analog television shutdown and digital conversion , which is tentatively scheduled to take place on  June 12 ,  2009 : [ 6 ]     WUNC-TV will move its digital broadcasts to channel 25; [ 7 ]   WUNE-TV, WUNM-TV, WUNP-TV, and WUNU will move their digital broadcasts back to their respective analog channel numbers (17, 19, 36, and 31); [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]   WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNK-TV, and WUNL-TV will continue digital broadcasts on their respective, pre-transition channel numbers (20, 25, 44, 29, 23, and 32). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]     In addition, UNC-TV opted not to join other broadcasters in the Wilmington market in the decision to switch to digital-only broadcasts on  September 8 ,  2008 , five months ahead of the national deadline. [ 18 ]  Following that date, WUNJ-TV became Wilmington's only full-power analog signal until the national  digital switchover  on  June 12 ,  2009 .   Through the use of  PSIP , digital television receivers will display  virtual channels  for each UNC-TV station corresponding to their present analog channel numbers.     [ edit ]   Translators   UNC-TV operates a number of  translators  across the mountains of western North Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area  repeaters  for WUNF and WUNE, mainly targeting towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.   Directly repeating WUNF:     W59AD   Andrews, NC   W41DI-D   Bat Cave, NC   W05AU   Bat Cave, NC  (Chimney Rock)   W52BA   Black Mountain, NC   W68DM   Brevard, NC   W46AX   Bryson City, NC   W27AB   Canton, NC  (To be upgraded to WUNW, a separate station)   W24AU   Cashiers, NC   W23AF   Cullowhee, NC   W28AN   Franklin, NC  (Wine Springs)   W60DA   Franklin, NC  (Cowee Bald)   W42AT   Hayesville, NC   W27BD   Highlands, NC   W31AN   Murphy, NC   W19CR   Tryon, NC     Directly repeating WUNE:     W42AZ   Bakersville, NC   W65DT   Boone, NC   W67DV   Burnsville, NC   W25AY   Jefferson, NC   W27AX   Lake Lure, NC   W43AU   Marion, NC   W35AD   Sparta, NC   W28AO   Spruce Pine, NC   W59AK   Zionville, NC       [ edit ]   Cable and satellite   UNC TV is available on cable television services throughout the state. It is also available in the  South Hampton Roads  area of Virginia ( Norfolk  and  Virginia Beach ) through  Cox Communications  and in the  Greenville, South Carolina  area through  Charter Communications .   On  DirecTV  and  Dish Network , WUNC-TV, WUND-TV, WUNF-TV, WUNG-TV, WUNJ-TV, WUNL-TV, and WUNK-TV are available on the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Greenville/ Spartanburg /Asheville, Charlotte, Triad, Wilmington and New Bern/Greenville/Washington local feeds, respectively.   The station carried on cable systems is not always the closest station. For example,  Time Warner Cable  (formerly Adelphia) in  Laurinburg  carries WUNJ of Wilmington, despite WUNU being closer in Lumberton.

Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits including  geostationary orbits ,  Molniya orbits , other  elliptical orbits  and low ( polar  and non-polar) Earth orbits.   For fixed ( point-to-point ) services, communications satellites provide a  microwave radio relay  technology complementary to that of  submarine communication cables . They are also used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio  broadcasting , for which application of other technologies, such as cable, is impractical or impossible.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits       Main article:  Geostationary orbit               Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites       Main article:  Low Earth orbit               Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites       Main article:  Molniya orbit               Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television       Main article:  Satellite television       Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite       Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite       Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite       Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite       A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated.

Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits including  geostationary orbits ,  Molniya orbits , other  elliptical orbits  and low ( polar  and non-polar) Earth orbits.   For fixed ( point-to-point ) services, communications satellites provide a  microwave radio relay  technology complementary to that of  submarine communication cables . They are also used for mobile applications such as communications to ships, vehicles, planes and hand-held terminals, and for TV and radio  broadcasting , for which application of other technologies, such as cable, is impractical or impossible.

[ edit ]   Early missions   The first satellite equipped with on-board  radio - transmitter  that worked on two frequences, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz was the Soviet  Sputnik 1 , launched in 1957. The first American satellite to relay communications was  Project SCORE  in  1958 , which used a tape recorder to  store and forward  voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower .  NASA  launched an  Echo satellite  in  1960 ; the 100-foot aluminized  PET film  balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  Courier 1B , (built by  Philco ) also launched in 1960, was the worlds first active repeater satellite.   Telstar  was the first active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to  AT&T  as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T,  Bell Telephone Laboratories , NASA, the British  General Post Office , and the  French National PTT  (Post Office) to develop satellite communication, it was launched by NASA from  Cape Canaveral  on  July 10 ,  1962 , the first privately sponsored space launch. Telstar was placed in an elliptical  orbit  (completed once every 2 hours and 37 minutes), rotating at a 45 angle above the  equator .   An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was  Hughes   Syncom 2 , launched on  July 26 ,  1963 . Syncom 2 revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it.     [ edit ]   Geostationary orbits   Main article:  Geostationary orbit           Geostationary orbit       A satellite in a  geostationary orbit  appears to be in a fixed position to an earth-based observer. A geostationary satellite revolves around the earth at a constant speed once per day over the equator.   The geostationary orbit is useful for communications applications because ground based antennas, which must be directed toward the satellite, can operate effectively without the need for expensive equipment to track the satellites motion. Especially for applications that require a large number of ground antennas (such as direct TV distribution), the savings in ground equipment can more than justify the extra cost and onboard complexity of lifting a satellite into the relatively high geostationary orbit.   The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by  Arthur C. Clarke , building on work by  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  and on the 1929 work by  Herman Potonik  (writing as  Herman Noordung )  Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-motor . In October  1945  Clarke published an article titled  Extra-terrestrial Relays  in the British magazine  Wireless World . The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of  artificial satellites  in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the  inventor  of the communications satellite.   The first truly geostationary satellite launched in orbit was the  Syncom 3 , launched on  August 19 ,  1964 . It was placed in orbit at 180 east  longitude , over the  International Date Line . It was used that same year to relay experimental television coverage on the  1964 Summer Olympics  in  Tokyo, Japan  to the  United States , the first television transmission sent over the  Pacific Ocean .   Shortly after  Syncom 3 ,  Intelsat I , aka  Early Bird , was launched on  April 6 ,  1965  and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the  Atlantic Ocean .   On  November 9 ,  1972 ,  North America 's first geostationary satellite serving the continent,  Anik A1 , was launched by  Telesat Canada , with the  United States  following suit with the launch of  Westar 1  by  Western Union  on  April 13 ,  1974 .   On  December 19 ,  1974 , the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be  three-axis stabilized  was launched: the Franco-German  Symphonie .   After the launchings of Telstar, Syncom 3, Early Bird, Anik A1, and Westar 1, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now  SES Americom ) launched  Satcom 1  in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early  cable TV  channels such as WTBS (now  TBS Superstation ),  HBO ,  CBN  (now  ABC Family ), and  The Weather Channel  become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local  cable TV   headends  using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like  ABC ,  NBC , and  CBS , to distribute their programming their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1  was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24  transponders  as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.   By 2000  Hughes Space and Communications  (now  Boeing Satellite Development Center ) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include  Space Systems/Loral ,  Orbital Sciences Corporation  with the  STAR Bus  series,  Lockheed Martin  (owns former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business),  Northrop Grumman , Alcatel Space, now  Thales Alenia Space , with the  Spacebus  series, and  EADS Astrium .     [ edit ]   Low-Earth-orbiting satellites   Main article:  Low Earth orbit           Low Earth orbit  in Cyan       A  Low Earth Orbit  (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 400 kilometres above the earths surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes. Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1000 kilometres from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.   Low earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, don't require as high  signal strength  (Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.   A group of satellites working in concert thus is known as a  satellite constellation . Two such constellations which were intended for provision for  satellite phone  services, primarily to remote areas, were the  Iridium  and  Globalstar . The Iridium system has 66 satellites. Another LEO satellite constellation known as  Teledesic , with backing from  Microsoft  entrepreneur  Paul Allen , was to have over 840 satellites. This was later scaled back to 288 and ultimately ended up only launching one test satellite.   It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of  Canada s  CASSIOPE  communications satellite. Another system using this  store and forward  method is  Orbcomm     [ edit ]   Molniya satellites   Main article:  Molniya orbit           Molniya orbit       As mentioned, geostationary satellites are constrained to operate above the equator. As a consequence, they are not always suitable for providing services at high latitudes: for at high latitudes a geostationary satellite may appear low on the horizon, affecting connectivity and causing  multipathing  (interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground into the ground antenna). The first satellite of  Molniya  series was launched on  April 23 ,  1965  and was used for experimental  transmission  of TV  signal  from Moscow  uplink  station to  downlink  stations, located in  Siberia  and Russian Far East, in  Norilsk ,  Khabarovsk ,  Magadan  and  Vladivostok . In November of  1967  Soviet engineers created a unique  system  of national TV  network  of  satellite television , called  Orbita , that was based on Molniya satellites.   Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon. Thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees).   Furthermore, the Molniya orbit is so designed that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for eight hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.   Molniya satellites are typically used for telephony and TV services over  Russia . Another application is to use them for mobile radio systems (even at lower latitudes) since cars travelling through urban areas need access to satellites at high elevation in order to secure good connectivity, e.g. in the presence of tall buildings.     [ edit ]   Applications     [ edit ]   Telephony          An  Iridium  satellite       The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental  long distance  telephony. The fixed  Public Switched Telephone Network  relays  telephone calls  from  land line  telephones to an  earth station , where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in  submarine communications cables , through the use of  fiber-optics , caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still serve remote islands such as  Ascension Island ,  Saint Helena ,  Diego Garcia , and  Easter Island , where no submarine cables are in service. There are also regions of some continents and countries where  landline  telecommunciations are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of  South America ,  Africa ,  Canada ,  China ,  Russia , and  Australia . Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of  Antarctica  and  Greenland .   Satellite phones  connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite  teleport  connected to the  Public Switched Telephone Network  or to another satellite phone system.     [ edit ]   Satellite television   Main article:  Satellite television   Television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large  bandwidth  to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS)   The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the  Astra ,  Eutelsat , and  Hotbird  spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.     [ edit ]   Fixed Service Satellite   Main article:  Fixed Service Satellite   Fixed Service Satellites  use the  C band , and the lower portions of the K u  bands. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming,  live shots , and  backhauls ), as well as being used for  distance learning  by schools and universities,  business television  (BTV),  Videoconferencing , and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to  cable television headends .   Free-to-air  satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K u  band. The  Intelsat Americas 5 ,  Galaxy 10R  and  AMC 3  satellites over  North America  provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K u  band  transponders .   The American  Dish Network  DBS service has also recently utilized FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their  SuperDish  antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the  FCC 's ""must-carry"" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry  HDTV  channels.     [ edit ]   Direct broadcast satellite   Main article:  Direct broadcast satellite   A  direct broadcast satellite  is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave  K u  band . DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ( Direct-To-Home ) satellite TV services, such as  DirecTV  and  DISH Network  in the  United States ,  Bell TV  And  Star Choice  in  Canada ,  Freesat  in the UK and  Sky Digital  in the UK, the  Republic of Ireland , and  New Zealand .   Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5m) in diameter for K u  band, and 12 feet (3.6m) or larger for C band). They use  linear polarization  for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to  circular polarization  used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users don't notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of  TVRO  (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K u  band form for the now-defunct  Primestar  satellite TV service.   Satellites for communication have now [ when? ]  been launched that have transponders in the  K a  band , such as DirecTV's  SPACEWAY-1  satellite, and  Anik F2 .  NASA  as well has launched experimental satellites using the K a  band recently.     [ edit ]   Mobile satellite technologies   Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with that arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using  GPS  technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (that the antenna is mounted on) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some  recreational vehicle  owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by  JetBlue Airways  for DirecTV (supplied by  LiveTV , a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.
