Despite their comical appearance, penguins are the most successful avian predators of the Southern Oceans. Penguins can run as fast as most men, and swim faster than most fish. They are perfectly adapted to a half life between land and sea.   Learn more.

Penguins have undergone huge declines in certain regions, and some penguins face the very real prospect of extinction unless something is done to help.  Click here to learn about the threats facing penguins      In September 2000, penguin conservationists from all over the world gathered at La Serena to discuss ways in which penguins could be protected. A number of wide-ranging proposals were drafted, and the International Penguin Conservation Work Group was formed.

""Inside the mind of a crime writer"". The Times.  ""Pascoe, edgy, ambivalent about his work, and far better educated than Dalziel, makes a terrific foil, as does Sergeant Wield. In the first few books Wield is little more than a walk-on character best known for his incredible ugliness. Later, he allows his close colleagues - and the reader - to learn that he is gay. And later still, in The Wood Beyond, Hill allows him to make a happy relationship with an antiquarian bookseller.""           [ edit ]   External links     About Gay Movies     Contents:   Top  -  09   A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X   Y   Z                 v      d      e     Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender  fiction             Characters     In comics  ( List )      In modern written fiction       In mythology       In video games     In film, radio, and TV fiction      Category:  Fictional LGBT characters               Creators     List of LGBT writers      Categories:  LGBT writers  ( by country ),  Gay writers ,  Lesbian writers ,  Bisexual writers ,  Transgender and transsexual writers ,  LGBT screenwriters               Culture     Lambda Literary Award  ( Winners )      Stonewall Book Award     Gaylactic Spectrum Awards     Gaylaxicon SF convention     Film festivals               By genre     In speculative fiction  ( List )      In children's literature    Teen fiction:  Gay male ,  Lesbian    Pulp fiction:  Gay male ,  Lesbian       Queer horror     Yaoi       Yuri     Class S     Lesbian erotica     Homoeroticism       Slash fiction  ( Femslash )      TV shows       TV episodes       Films      Category:  LGBT films  ( Lesbian-related films )               By sexuality     LGBT literature     Lesbian fiction   (List)       Transgender and transsexual fiction  and  film and TV     Media portrayal of bisexuality  ( List )     Media portrayal of lesbianism     Media portrayal of sexual orientation                       Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LGBT_characters_in_film,_radio,_and_TV_fiction ""      Categories :  Lists of film characters  |  Lists of radio characters  |  Lists of television characters  |  Fictional LGBT characters  |  Lists of LGBT fictional characters Hidden categories:  Incomplete lists                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                                                Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                   Languages                Portugus                                                    This page was last modified on 4 March 2009, at 15:39.

""Inside the mind of a crime writer"". The Times.  ""Pascoe, edgy, ambivalent about his work, and far better educated than Dalziel, makes a terrific foil, as does Sergeant Wield. In the first few books Wield is little more than a walk-on character best known for his incredible ugliness. Later, he allows his close colleagues - and the reader - to learn that he is gay. And later still, in The Wood Beyond, Hill allows him to make a happy relationship with an antiquarian bookseller.""           [ edit ]   External links     About Gay Movies     Contents:   Top  -  09   A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X   Y   Z                 v      d      e     Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender  fiction             Characters     In comics  ( List )      In modern written fiction       In mythology       In video games     In film, radio, and TV fiction      Category:  Fictional LGBT characters               Creators     List of LGBT writers      Categories:  LGBT writers  ( by country ),  Gay writers ,  Lesbian writers ,  Bisexual writers ,  Transgender and transsexual writers ,  LGBT screenwriters               Culture     Lambda Literary Award  ( Winners )      Stonewall Book Award     Gaylactic Spectrum Awards     Gaylaxicon SF convention     Film festivals               By genre     In speculative fiction  ( List )      In children's literature    Teen fiction:  Gay male ,  Lesbian    Pulp fiction:  Gay male ,  Lesbian       Queer horror     Yaoi       Yuri     Class S     Lesbian erotica     Homoeroticism       Slash fiction  ( Femslash )      TV shows       TV episodes       Films      Category:  LGBT films  ( Lesbian-related films )               By sexuality     LGBT literature     Lesbian fiction   (List)       Transgender and transsexual fiction  and  film and TV     Media portrayal of bisexuality  ( List )     Media portrayal of lesbianism     Media portrayal of sexual orientation                       Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LGBT_characters_in_film,_radio,_and_TV_fiction ""      Categories :  Lists of film characters  |  Lists of radio characters  |  Lists of television characters  |  Fictional LGBT characters  |  Lists of LGBT fictional characters Hidden categories:  Incomplete lists                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                                                Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                   Languages                Portugus                                                    This page was last modified on 4 March 2009, at 15:39.

""Inside the mind of a crime writer"". The Times.  ""Pascoe, edgy, ambivalent about his work, and far better educated than Dalziel, makes a terrific foil, as does Sergeant Wield. In the first few books Wield is little more than a walk-on character best known for his incredible ugliness. Later, he allows his close colleagues - and the reader - to learn that he is gay. And later still, in The Wood Beyond, Hill allows him to make a happy relationship with an antiquarian bookseller.""           [ edit ]   External links     About Gay Movies     Contents:   Top  -  09   A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X   Y   Z                 v      d      e     Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender  fiction             Characters     In comics  ( List )      In modern written fiction       In mythology       In video games     In film, radio, and TV fiction      Category:  Fictional LGBT characters               Creators     List of LGBT writers      Categories:  LGBT writers  ( by country ),  Gay writers ,  Lesbian writers ,  Bisexual writers ,  Transgender and transsexual writers ,  LGBT screenwriters               Culture     Lambda Literary Award  ( Winners )      Stonewall Book Award     Gaylactic Spectrum Awards     Gaylaxicon SF convention     Film festivals               By genre     In speculative fiction  ( List )      In children's literature    Teen fiction:  Gay male ,  Lesbian    Pulp fiction:  Gay male ,  Lesbian       Queer horror     Yaoi       Yuri     Class S     Lesbian erotica     Homoeroticism       Slash fiction  ( Femslash )      TV shows       TV episodes       Films      Category:  LGBT films  ( Lesbian-related films )               By sexuality     LGBT literature     Lesbian fiction   (List)       Transgender and transsexual fiction  and  film and TV     Media portrayal of bisexuality  ( List )     Media portrayal of lesbianism     Media portrayal of sexual orientation                       Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LGBT_characters_in_film,_radio,_and_TV_fiction ""      Categories :  Lists of film characters  |  Lists of radio characters  |  Lists of television characters  |  Fictional LGBT characters  |  Lists of LGBT fictional characters Hidden categories:  Incomplete lists                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                                                Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                   Languages                Portugus                                                    This page was last modified on 4 March 2009, at 15:39.

And later still, in The Wood Beyond, Hill allows him to make a happy relationship with an antiquarian bookseller.""           [ edit ]   External links     About Gay Movies     Contents:   Top  -  09   A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X   Y   Z                 v      d      e     LGBT   fiction             Characters     In comics  ( List )      In modern written fiction       In mythology       In video games     In film, radio, and TV fiction      Category:  Fictional LGBT characters               Creators     List of LGBT writers      Categories:  LGBT writers  ( by country ),  Gay writers ,  Lesbian writers ,  Bisexual writers ,  Transgender and transsexual writers ,  LGBT screenwriters               Culture     Lambda Literary Award  ( Winners )      Stonewall Book Award     Gaylactic Spectrum Awards     Gaylaxicon SF convention     Film festivals               By genre     In speculative fiction :  Gay male ,  Lesbian       In children's literature    Teen fiction:  Gay male ,  Lesbian    Pulp fiction:  Gay male ,  Lesbian       Queer horror     Yaoi       Yuri     Class S     Lesbian erotica     Homoeroticism       Slash fiction  ( Femslash  and  Gayfic )      TV shows       TV episodes       Films      Category:  LGBT films  ( Lesbian-related films )               By sexuality     LGBT literature     Lesbian fiction   (List)       Transgender and transsexual fiction  and  film and TV     Media portrayal of bisexuality  ( List' )     Media portrayal of lesbianism     Media portrayal of sexual orientation                       Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LGBT_characters_in_film,_radio,_and_TV_fiction ""      Categories :  Lists of film characters  |  Lists of radio characters  |  Lists of television characters  |  Fictional LGBT characters  |  Lists of LGBT fictional characters Hidden category:  Incomplete lists                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                                                Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                   Languages                Portugus                                                    This page was last modified on 17 February 2009, at 04:13.

By John Nova Lomax                   write to the editor  |  email a friend  |  print article  |  write your comment How 'douchebag' became everyone's favorite insult     By  Joe Eskenazi   Published on January 05, 2009 at 5:13pm   Anyone with cable television or an Internet hookup knows all too well that this is the dawning of the age of the douchebag. While the term for a feminine hygiene implement traces its history back to 1685, its slang incarnation now proliferates on the airwaves and the Web. Face it: We're surrounded by douchebags.              Subject(s):   Joe Eskenazi on douchebag   This comes as no surprise to the nation's linguists. They even have a term for this sort of thing: pejoration. That's when a neutral word takes on a negative meaning. The  Oxford English Dictionary  traces this process back to 1967, when ""douchebag"" was a popular epithet for ""an unattractive coed""; it has since morphed into ""a general term of disparagement,  esp.  for an unattractive or boring person.""    James Matisoff, an emeritus professor in UC Berkeley's linguistics department, concurs that douchebag's pejoration has snowballed in recent years. The culprits: Jon Stewart and his comedic brethren. ""On cable, you can use a word which has a perfectly innocent meaning — like 'balls' or 'nuts,'"" he says. ""Jon Stewart can use it freely. If he were to say 'fuck,' 'shit,' or 'cunt,' that gets bleeped."" (Incidentally, Stewart does, and they are.) The words ""douche"" and ""douchebag"" seem to be mentioned daily on  The Daily Show , whether it's John Oliver reporting on George Washington (""a quintessential American douche""), Jason Jones explaining how Mitt Romney was stumping for ""the douchebag vote,"" or Stewart himself awarding Robert Novak the Huge Douchebag award.    Yet among those who study profanity for a living, the douchebag is kid stuff. Reinhold Aman of Cotati publishes  Maledicta , ""the international journal of verbal aggression."" He rattles off a series of curses that knock the vinegar out of douchebag: ""I shit in the beard of your father"" (Persia); ""Your mother's milk is camel's piss"" (the Arab world); ""Your parents have diseased genitals"" (Ghana); and ""I fuck the soul of your dead mother"" (Serbian Gypsies). He hesitates before revealing the most vile, horrific curse he's ever come across, a lament from Hungary's peasantry: ""Oh God, stop slapping me in the face with your cock all covered with shit from fucking Jesus.""    Aman pauses to let that one settle in. ""Douchebag is nothing! It's harmless, like an enema, you know?""               write your comment                                                                                          Advanced Archive Search >>                                   Weekly    Music    Promotions    Dining    Events              Subscribe                                                                     foam order.com             Platform beds      Cushions      Tempur-Pedic Mattress      Memory Foam Mattress      Neoprene      Packing Foam      Mattress pads                                  Now Click This             Become an SF Weekly Facebook fan                 Become an SF Weekly Mastermind and win $2500 in cash!
