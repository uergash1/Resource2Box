Some recommendations         6 ECTS units include theoretical lessons (3h per week) and group tutor sessions (practical lessons in reduced groups, 3 or 4 lessons per semester).   7'5 ECTS include theoretical lessons (3h per week), practical lessons and personal tutored sessions.    It is highly recommended to follow these units in the sequenced order:       Field Practices in SCA I (Prcticas de Campo en Antropologa Social y Cultural I)   Investigation Methods in SCA (Mtodos de Investigacin en Antropologa Social y Cultural)    Investigation Techniques in SCA (Tcnicas de Investigacin en Antropologa Social y Cultural)   Field Practices in SCA II (Prcticas de Campo en Antropologa Social y Cultural II)     Field Practices in SCA I  includes 7 theoretical lessons throughout the semester and personal tutored sessions every 15 days (30 minutes). Both are compulsory to pass the unit.     The mark ""PL"" on a subject means that you must have 30 minutes at that moment to hold a personal tutored hour with your teacher (30 minutes).
