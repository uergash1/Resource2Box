That was a no-brainer. I felt cheated because the explanations to those problems were already in the Guides. MGMAT also shows you problems that are not relevant to GMAT - they want to make it appear as if GMAT is a test for becoming a rocket scientist. I invested in MLIC guides and was pleasantly surprised to find materials that were actually tested on the GMAT. I strongly recommend MLIC Guides for GMAT.             --- Maria Peterson, Dallas, TX""   ""After taking the GMAT and scoring 620, I decided to purchase MLIC's study notes for the GMAT, and was taken aback to find that some of the problems illustrated in the guides were very similar to, if not identical to, the a few problems I had struggled with during the test. Had I bought the guides before I took the test, I sure would have scored much better than I did and would not be writing this testimonial. MLIC materials provide strategies as well that are truly useful in dealing with critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The module 3 for sentence correction very comprehensively covers all grammar, idiom, and logic rules tested in SC.  MLIC study guides are a worthwhile investment.            --- Maralee Smith, Chicago, IL""   ""My verbal jumped quite significantly from 51 percentile to 89. Your study materials for the verbal section was really good and really helpful. Really taught me how to solve the questions. The materials were spot on in letting me know what to look for in the questions. Thanks to your thorough study guides and your  online program, my verbal scored improved a cool 40 percentile points. Your guides are the best.            --- K. Pine,Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia""     ""I took the Veritas prep course before I ordered MLIC GMAT study guides, and found the Veritas guides shallow in comparison.  Veritas course materials are the ones published by 800Score.com and Arco, and they use some retired GMAT questions. Veritas instructor was not as well informed either (he could not explain the concept of LCM in quantitative assessment).  In contrast, the MLIC study notes covered all areas extensively, and included discussion of areas I have never seen in any other prep materials available in the book stores. MLIC guides are worth more than the money I paid for them.            --- I. RAJA, PHILADELPHIA, PA""    ""I truly believe that all GMAT testtakers should obtain the amazingly thorough and profoundly relevant GMAT Study materials by MLIC that surely beat all other prep materials I have seen. I have worked through Manhattan GMAT and a mate gave me the Veritas guides before I bought MLIC prep notes. MLIC study notes for the GMAT are the best you can use to crack this test. Each of those modules covering the various GMAT sections is a gem, and you should not do without them.             --- Tom Osborn, Sydney, Australia""   ""I want to let you know that the incredible detail you pack into each GMAT study and training file allowed me to prepare for each GMAT section in the required depth. I had taken the Veritas GMAT prep course in December 2005. MLIC Study materials were vastly superior to those provided by Veritas Elite company. When I originally took my first practice exam after I took the Veritas course and before I took your Turboprep GMAT course, I scored a depressing 450.  Then, I took the Turboprep GMAT course and I scored a 680 on the GMAT.  A 230 point improvement, landing me in the 89th percentile and allowing a more competitive shot for admission to Columbia Business School.  I want to thank you for putting together such a terrific study guides and training materials. It was intensive and it provided me with the correct foundation and knowledge to gain the GMAT score that I was aiming for.""             --- JOSHUA SOFER, GMAT Turboprep course, Manhattan-NYC  GMAT Hall of Famer     ""Your study guides for the GMAT are the best preparatory materials I have laid my hands on. Your Study Guides are the most detailed and thorough, and the conversational style of explaining the concepts and procedures helped me master the GMAT sections. I must admit that I was slightly overwhelmed to work through 700+ pages of study files, over 2000 practice problems, and timed practice tests with pacing assistant (comments were cute!). However, it was worth it. Your GMAT study guides were the best use I found for my 79 dollars.""                    --- Erika Hanson, Topeka, Kansas             ""I thought Manhattan GMAT study guides were the best one could work with until I purchased MLIC study notes for the GMAT. Your study materials are the best and beat Manhattan GMAT hands down. I strongly recommend your study guides.  Good stuff.           Mallika Srinivasan, Chennai,India.""      ""I recently ordered your GMAT Study Guides and want to thank you for the excellent treatment of all GMAT concepts. The Reading Comprehension guide explaining the Ancho-phrase strategy for GMAT RC section is brilliant. I have never seen GMAT sentence correction rules and requirements explained in such detail and in depth. I am glad that I found your web-link through the blog at Business Week. I recommend your GMAT study materials to anyone seriously looking for a terrific GMAT score .""           -- Melissa Yeong, New York City, NY.""      ""I think you guys at MLICETS have done a wonderful job with the GMAT study guide that I purchased from you. I have ordered numerous other study guides for the GMAT from your competitors and they don't come close to your quality. I have to admit the one thing that I liked about the            -- Basir Sakandar, Dallas, TX""    ""Anyone who is serious about making a GMAT test score in the 700's required by top Business Schools should order your GMAT Study Guides. Your GMAT study Guides undoubtedly are the most useful preparation notes for the GMAT. I am grateful that I used your GMAT study notes. It sure made a big difference to my GMAT score, which jumped a cool 90 points. Thanks again.           ----Stacy Newman, Dublin, Ireland.""    ""Your GMAT study materials are without a doubt better than Manhattan GMAT's study guides. I have been terrified of Reading Comprehension on the GMAT but your study guide made it seem like such an easy thing to do.  My ranking of your study guides is as follows:  (1) Module 2 file for GMAT quantitative; (2) Module 3 file for Sentence Correction; (3) Module 5 for Reading Comprehension; (4) Module 4 for Critical Reasoning; and (5) Module I file for the Analytical Writing. (Your format for the argument essay is the best I have seen and makes analyzing an argument such a breeze). I was impressed and overwhelmed with the amount of practice tests and exercises you provide along with the study guides. ""              Rajiv Aggarwal, Mumbai, India.""          WHAT IS GMAT® CAT?                  GMAT® , acronym for  G raduate  M anagement  A dmission  T est, is administered by Pearson Vue® on behalf of GMAC® and is required by all  G raduate  S chools of  B usiness for admission purposes.               The GMAT, according to  GMAC                (Graduate Management Admission Council that owns the trademarks GMAT®  and GMAT CAT®, is one measure of your ability to               complete sucessfully the first year of graduate study program (MBA degree program) at a Graduate School of Business.However, effective January 2006, the paper and pencil version of the GMAT test is no longer offered anywhere in the world. GMATis              administered in a CAT(Computer Adaptive) format in which the GMAT test'adapts' the              difficulty level of GMAT questions to your GMAT-specific 'comfort level', with 'higher              difficulty level GMAT questions' carrying higher GMAT raw scores (GMAT Scaled              Scores) than do 'lower difficulty level' GMAT questions. The              GMAT tests your Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning skills, and your ability (i) to process information in context, (ii) to make necessarily true and probable interpretations of information presented, (iii) to stay focused on the specifics, and (iv) to test different scenarios for consistency of decisions. The GMAT test also is about your ability to determine whether GMAT sentences are logically, clearly, correctly, and effectively written.        MBA PROGRAM RANKINGS     1.

Therefore, put away those useless study Guides for the GMAT published by Kaplan (KAPTEST), Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas GMAT prep, 800Score.com, Arco, Barrons, GMAT for Dummies, and others.               The GMAT study guides offered by MLIC are constantly updated to reflect changes              taking place on the GMAT test and to include information that mirrors the LIVE emphasis seen on the high difficulty problems tested on the GMAT.             Unlike other me-too prep outfits such as Kaplan, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas Prep, Manhattan Review, MLIC also updates its study guides and training materials frequently on the basis of a diagnosis of challenges faced by average trainees. The computer adaptive format of the test requires that the testing company - Pearson Vue -- create many different versions of the same test during a given month and vary the emphasis from time to time so that test-takers who repeat the tests do get tested with different emphasis the next time. MLIC study and training materials for the GMAT capture a variety of emphases monitored on the test, and get updated to reflect those changing emphases. Contrast this to the rather passive format of books published by Kaplan, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas Prep, Arco, Barrons, et al., and you can see why MLIC Study Guides are the best source for GMAT preparation. We dare you to show us a better set of guides for GMAT readiness than the ones offered by MLIC. ORDER our              skill-enhancing and goal-driven GMAT Study Guides for 700+ GMAT Score today through PAYPAL, and              get set on your way to a GMAT score of better than 700.                                                                           WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE STUDY GUIDES YOU CAN                BUY FROM KAPLAN, ARCO, PRINCETON REVIEW, Veritas Prep, Manhattan GMAT, Barrons, ET AL?    The  other  GMAT study guides                out there and published by Kaplan, Arco, Princeton Review, and others were probably written at least 10 years ago, and are                never updated. Veritas Prep provides study materials that are a veritable collage of materials sourced from Arco, Barrons, 800Score.Com, OG, Oxford, and other miscellaneous sources. Manhattan GMAT study guide for Sentence Correction uses the example 'having a bat is fun' to show you that the subject is 'having', not 'bat'. The problem with this example used in Manhattan GMAT book is that the subject is a gerund, and the sentence is not as idiomatic as the expletive form: ""It is fun to have a bat"". Secondly, GMAT sentences will use subject qualifiers, object qualifiers and modifiers, and verb complements, all in the same sentence. The GMAT sentences are not as simple as illustrated in MGMAT guide;  only MLIC teaches you how to diagram a sentence and identify the structural elements such as the qualifiers for subject, qualifiers for object, complements for the verbs, nouns, and qualifiers, etc. MLIC Guide for SC will also show you that GMAT Sentence Correction is not only about grammar and idiom rules but also about rules of logic. No other study guide out there will cover 1/10th of what MLIC guide covers. MLIC Guide for Critical Reasoning teaches you the subject-scope-qualifier strategy and trains you in answer selection by intelligently eliminating answer options by categorizing them as vague, extreme, politically incorrect, not commonsensical, commonsensical but expectational, etc.  Module V file for Reading Comprehension demystifies this section, and shows  you a workable 'anchor phrase strategy' that allows you to identify context-specific information relevant to the question. You will also learn in this file how you can pick the correct answer even if you did not have the time to read and comprehend the passage in its entirety. Our Module II and its companion guides such as ""Quantitative Concepts in a Nutshell"" will provide the most comprehensive coverage of quantitative concepts and procedures reflecting the current emphasis on the LIVE problems, and teach you different nuanced ways in which the concepts can be tested. For  example, the concept of weighted average, you will learn, is about how the midpoint of values shifts and how MUCH it shifts. The understanding of the former attribute is critical to answering some Data Sufficiency problems.  Last, but not least, our Module I file arms you with a good template for writing professional-grade essays. In short, MLIC Study Guides are the best preparatory materials and beat all other study guides and study notes published by other companies.   The GMAT CAT is constantly evolving and a GMAT study guide                that provides static information is not your best ally in your                effort to achieve the best possible GMAT test score.                The other GMAT study                guides such as the ones you can buy from Kaplan, Princeton Review, 800SCORE.COM, MANHATTAN GMAT, Veritas Prep,               or Arco do not cover all the concepts tested on the GMAT. To add                insult to injury, these other GMAT study guides published by Kaplan, Arco, Barrons, Princeton Review, and others focus on some                silly tricks that do not work most of the time, if at all. MLIC Study Guides for 700+ Score -- Your one-stop                comprehensive resource that will surely give you deeper                insights into the concepts and procedures relevant to acing the GMAT, and help you achieve a GMAT test score in the 700's.  ORDER THE GMAT STUDY GUIDES  using PALPAL today!                 WHY ARE OUR GMAT STUDY GUIDES BETTER THAN              THE 'OFFICIAL GUIDE FOR GMAT REVIEW'?                              The ""Official Guide to GMAT                  Review"" advises you that you must consult a good 'text book' to                  improve your GMAT-specific verbal and quantitative skills. The Official Guide to GMAT Review                  provides real GMAT questions that were tested about 7 to 10 years                  ago but does not disclose the most recent types of GMAT questions or                  show you how to develop and hone a good and solid understanding                  of the concepts tested on the GMAT CAT. The reason is simple: If                  the official Guide to GMAT Review gave you a GMAT strategy or showed you the                  appropriate best strategy for dealing with the different GMAT                  assessment areas, the integrity of the GMAT test will be compromised                  and the Business Schools will stop accepting GMAT as a                  requirement for admission. Also, the explanations provided for                  the various problems in the Official Guide to GMAT Review will                  require another GMAT guide to understand. (For example, the Official                  Guide explains why Choice B is incorrect by stating that 'it                  uses words in improper temporal sequence' or 'explains' the sets                  and conditional probability in terms of arcane and esoteric                  'formulas' rather than in terms of concepts.) GMAT is an                  'application test' and requires that you hone your skill in the                  GMAT concept areas, and further requires that you 'use your                  understanding of the concepts' to 'make LOGICAL decisions'. The                  Official Guide to GMAT Review will never explain the purpose of                  the GMAT or what it takes to do well on the GMAT test. Why? Because,                  let us face it, the real customers for the Educational Testing Service or the Graduate Management Admission Council  are                  not the poor test-takers such as you, but the Graduate Schools of Business,                  and it will be a suicidal proposition for the GMAT Testing Company to                  show all the cards, to disclose the best strategies for taking                  the GMAT test, and to train you with the most recent types of                  GMAT test questions. If they did, no Business School will require GMAT                  score as a necessary factor in the admission decision. Only our                  GMAT Study Guides will explain the GMAT-specific concepts in a manner that makes                  sense to all GMAT test-takers.

Because you are taking a GMAT in a                  timed-environment, we have designed the GMAT study materials to                  give you the conceptual skills and the understanding required to                  deal efficiently with the timed format of the GMAT test. You                  will learn the most efficient ways in which to deal with the                  quantitative and the verbal areas of the GMAT, and to manage                  your time wisely and to your best advantage.    MODULE I  file (75 pages) for Analytical Writing Assessment teaches you how to identify the specifics of the issue presented to you, and how to develop arguments in support of your clear and consistent position on the issues. It teaches you how to turn examples into perspectives and how to structure the analysis. A sure recipe for getting the top score of 6.0.  The section on Argument essay writing teaches you the basics of Arguments (a must read primer that logically leads into Critical Reasoning), and how to identify the assumptions of arguments by turning the maybe scenarios into assumptions. You will also be provided a template that works every time, and allows you to cover all required elements such as assumptions, counter-scenarios, counter-example, and questions seeking additional information by simply creating a list of maybe scenarios. Our trainees have consistently found this format compelling and a sure recipe for the top score of 6.0     MODULE II  file (220 pages) along with its companion guides titled 'Quantitative Concepts in a nutshell""(80 pages) and ""geometry formulas"" (25 pages) provide the most comprehensive coverage of all concepts and procedures tested in Quantitative assessment. The newer emphasis monitored on the test in the areas of standard deviation, sequences and functions, coordinate geometry, combinatorics and conditional probability, are all extensively covered and illustrated with problems reflecting the emphasis seen on LIVE GMAT problems. You will also learn that the concepts of ratios/proportion and weighted averages are tested in many ways: as mixture problems, as distance problems, as probability, and in geometry. You will learn how to make PONFI interpretation of information presented to you so that you can test for consistency across different scenarios while dealing with data sufficiency section. As many who purchased our study guides have opined, this module alone is worth the price of $79 you will pay for the entire gold mine of 5 major modules.    MODULE III  file (120 pages) and its companion guide ""Sentence Correction in a nutshell""(60 pages) cover all grammar, idiom, and logic rules, and rules of parallelism tested in Sentence Correction. You will learn how to dissect a sentence in terms of subject, qualifiers for subject and object, and complements for verbs and qualifiers, etc. and to identify the problems in sentences. A complex sentence such as the following needs to be dissected as shown: ""The work of John Voigt, a world-renowned physicist at the University of Melbourne, on the geometry of crystals that have not been fully analyzed has great significance in the study of Islamic architecture predating 16th century."" The subject 'work' has been described in terms of 'whose work it is' and in terms of 'in what area the work was done'. The object of the qualifier 'of John Voigt' is modified by the phrase that follows the comma. The object of the qualifier 'on the geometry of crystals' is qualified in terms of 'crystals that have not been fully analyzed'. The complement 'significance' is qualified with an adjective and another qualifier. Notice that the qualifiers add information to the sentence and also create distraction. The subject 'work' needs to be matched to the verb 'has' that is separated by intervening qualifiers for subject and object. No other guide out there (believe us, Manhattan GMAT guide is a joke) will explain the intricacies involved in getting a grasp of the elements of a sentence. You will learn a whole host of other good stuff that will enable you to master this section. MLIC Guide for Sentence Correction is the best prep notes you can find for Sentence Correction.     MODULE IV  file (120 pages) covering Critical Reasoning trains you in identifying different types of arguments, shows you how to process the information by being a qualifier police and a 'ly' detector. You will also learn that the selection is a process that is about determining why you will NOT pick 4 of the 5 options, and on what basis to make that determination. The module will also teach you was statements and what specific elements within a statement constitute important items of information critical to the answer. Various types of questions are illustrated with plenty of examples and detailed critiques.     MODULE V  file (120 pages) for Reading Comprehension teaches you how to determine the MAIN IDEA of the passage by identifying the elements of emphasis and transitional phrases within the passage and how to process the contents of the passage in terms of its structure: context, commentary, and basis for commentary. You will also learn the anchor-phrase™ strategy for identifying context-specific information relevant to the question. Last, but not least, there is a chapter on how to arrive at the correct answer even without knowing what the passage is about. MLIC has cracked the mystery behind Reading Comprehension and shows you how to attack this section.

GMAT AWA:  Analysis of an                        Issue Essay  measures your ability to understand the                        crux of the Issue provided, to take a position, and to                        explain your position by making two different arguments                        looking at the issue from two different perspectives.                         The  Argument  essay measures your ability to                        critique an argument and to explain why the conclusion                        stated in the argument does not logically follow from the                        evidence provided. You will be required to identify the                        various assumptions made in the line of reasoning, and to                        suggest counter scenarios that will 'question' the                        validity of the assumptions. Our GMAT Study Guides will explain                        the requirements and give you a structured format that                        will help you get the perfect score in the GMAT AWA section.                                                 GMAT VERBAL:  The GMAT                        sentence correction  section is about your ability to apply the rules of grammar, idiom, and logic to determine whether the sentence as written meets the test or requires fixing. This section will require that you identify the specifics of the sentence in terms of the subject, verb, complement, qualifiers for subject, object, and the complement, and that you ensure that the sentence is written in a logical fashion. The purpose of a sentence is to express a complete and logical thought, and to be consistent with the rules of grammar, idiom, and logic. You will be required to enforce subject-verb agreement and noun-pronoun agreement, fix pronoun problems including problems arising from the use of relative pronouns, use correct verb tense, and to make sure that the qualifiers and modifiers are placed correctly in the sentence. You will also be required to make sure that the comparisons that are  sought to be made are apples and apples comparisons and logically made. Consider the following sentence:  ""Within the past few years, many physicians have chosen early retirement rather than face the prospect of lawsuits."" Notice that the sentence states that the physicians have chosen a NOUN (early retirement) rather than a VERB (face the prospect of lawsuits). This is illogical comparison involving a noun and a verb. We can change the sentence to read: ""Within the past few years, many physicians have chosen early retirement rather than lawsuits filed against them."" However, this would not be logical because the physicians DO NOT CHOOSE LAWSUITS. Lawsuits come to them. A more logical fix would be to say, ""within the past few years, many physicians have elected TO RETIRE early rather than (to) FACE THE PROSPECT of lawsuits."" Notice that the correct answer logically states that the physicians chose one verb instead of another (parallel use of infinitives).    The GMAT study guides by MLIC  will show                        you how to recognize the requirements of grammar, idiom, and logic, and to identify various elements of a GMAT sentence in order to get a handle on all of these requirements. No                        other study material for the GMAT covers the GMAT Sentence Correction section as                        thoroughly and as comprehensively as our GMAT Study Guides do.                            The GMAT  CRITICAL                        REASONING  section tests your ability to make LOGICAL                        Conclusions or Inferences, to make logical explanations, and                        to deal with the ILLOGICAL arguments in terms of looking                        for information that will weaken it or strengthen it or                        identify the underlying assumption. GMAT Critical Reasoning section requires                        that the GMAT test-takers pay attention to QUALIFIERS used to                         LIMIT THE SCOPE   of the GMAT arguments, and to deal                        with the  SPECIFICS of the                        CONCLUSION , without interpreting the conclusion.                        For example, if the conclusion reads:  ""The                         continuing war effort in Iraq   will lead to                        increase in gas prices"",  you should not 'interpret'                        this conclusion to mean that  'the                        continuing war  on terror  is                        unethical or bad for the global economy' . You                        should be looking to weaken or strengthen this GMAT argument by                        looking for a reason why or why not the 'continuing war                        effort in IRAQ (not in Afghanistan or the 'war on terror')                        will  necessarily  lead to increase in gas prices'. Our                        GMAT Study Guides will explain the Subject/Scope/Qualifier                        strategy, and give you a set of HIT LIST words and phrases                        so that you can take the GMAT test in an efficient and effective manner.                            GMAT Reading                        Comprehension  is about your ability to identify the COMMENTARY that is made by the author by looking for and identifying statements containing emphasis, strong tones, transitional elements such as however, yet, on the contrary, and figures of speech. You will be required to identify the structure of the passages in terms of context, commentary, and basis for commentary, and to deal with questions asking you to show comprehension of commentary and to handle questions dealing with the context and basis for commentary. GMAT Study Guides will show you how to identify the commentary and how to hone in on information relevant to the question by using anchor-phrase strategy. You will also learn how to pick the correct answer even if you do not have a good understanding of the passage or did not have the time to read the passage. MLIC Study Guides are the best as evidenced by the fact that our LSAT trainees, who have to deal with 4 long passages and 27 questions in 35 minutes, unanimously opine that they have never found anything that is as extraordinary as MLIC Guides.                                                   GMAT QUANTITATIVE                        ASSESSMENT : This GMAT section is about your ability to                        apply your conceptual understanding of  Arithmetic,                        Algebra, Geometry, and Statistics  to solve problems                        and to determine whether there is sufficient information                        with which to make a unique and logical determination with                        respect to a question posed. This GMAT test section is about your                        REASONING ABILITY and about your comfort level with the                        different GMAT quantitative concepts tested. Bear in mind that the GMAT test is about 'making                        decisions' by using 'what is already known at a conceptual                        level' and 'what else is provided in the problem'. For                        example, if the GMAT problem states that  ""X is                        a prime digit"",  we must interpret this statement to                        mean that X could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 because a  'digit'  is an  integer   having                        a value between 0 and 9. You will learn in our valuable                        MODULE II dealing with GMAT Quantitative Assessment how to                        hone your conceptual understanding of GMAT quantitative areas, and how to reason from                        your 'conceptual ground zero'. Our GMAT Study Guides users would have us                        believe that our GMAT Quantitative MODULE II explaining the GMAT Quantitative                        Assessment alone is worth the $79 charge for the entire                        set of GMAT study guides. We dare you to find anything that is better than our guides for Quantitative assessment.                                               WHAT IS GMAT (GRADUATE MANAGEMENT ADMISSION TEST), AND WHAT DOES              GMAT MEASURE?                            GMAT® , acronym for  Graduate Management Admission              Test,  is the registered trademark of              Graduate Management Admission Council, and   is a              standard requirement for admission to Graduate Business Schools and to all M.B.A. degree programs in the USA and around the world .  The              GMAT test Score is one of several critical factors used by the              Graduate Schools of Business in their admission decisions, and a GMAT              test score that corresponds to a percentile ranking of 85% to 90% is a              must for your application to be seriously considered for admission to M.B.A. degree program at an A-List school. The              GMAT test is administered in a CAT format in which the GMAT test 'adapts' the              difficulty level of the GMAT to your 'comfort level'. The GMAT is              about your ability to do Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning, and to deal with the 'specifics' of the information              presented to you, and about your ability to make 'logical              interpretation' of the conceptual and other evidence presented to              you. The test measures your ability to    provide logical explanations for phenomena or observations;    provide alternative explanations for evidentiary information;    logically explain a discrepancy or a paradox;    Process information in context and interpret information in a necessarily true way;    make logical decisions by invoking core concepts tested on the GMAT;    understand and stay focused on the question, and pick an answer that is relevant to the question;    see patterns and do logical extrapolations, among other things.     The GMAT® has three              assessment areas:    AWA  (Analytical Writing Assessment)              that requires you to write Two essays, one analyzing an Issue              and the other analyzing an Argument. This first essay section on the GMAT is not 'adaptive'              and receives a separate score of between 0 and 6.   GMAT Quantitative Assessment  is the first              of the two 'adaptive' sections on the GMAT and follows the Analytical Writing section, and requires that you              answer 37 questions in problem solving and in Data Sufficiency in 75 minutes (nearly 1/4 of the questions will not be scored). Following the GMAT Quantitative section, you will be required to work on the last 'adaptive' section on              the GMAT is  Verbal              Assessment , which requires that you answer 41              questions in 75 minutes. The GMAT Verbal assessment includes three sections: GMAT Critical Reasoning, GMAT Sentence Correction, and GMAT Reading Comprehension. GMAT adaptive sections also include              experimental questions, at least 9 in GMAT Quantitative assessment and 11              in GMAT Verbal assessment. The two adaptive sections on the GMAT receive a combined             score of between 200 and 800. Most A-List Business Schools rated in the top-10 will              require a GMAT test score of at least 680 in order for you to be              competitive. (the percentile rankings corresponding to scores of between 600 and 640 have decreased in the past few years). Your best chance for success lies in your ability to              take the GMAT exam at the high difficulty level throughout and to score better than 700. The MLICETS GMAT prep              courses offer the best GMAT test training, using the  most recent and high difficulty level questions that are live on the GMAT  so that              you can competently and confidently take the GMAT test in a timed-environment, and achieve a score of better than 700.

Related subjects:  Education                 The  SAT Reasoning Test  (formerly  Scholastic Aptitude Test  and  Scholastic Assessment Test ) is a   standardized test for   college admissions in the  United States . The SAT is owned, published, and developed by the   College Board, a   non-profit organization in the United States, and was once developed, published, and scored by the   Educational Testing Service (ETS). ETS now administers the exam.                      Map of states according to preferred exam of 2006 high school graduates. States in orange had more students taking the SAT than the   ACT.                          The current SAT Reasoning Test is administered in about four hours and costs $43 ($68 International), excluding late fees. Since the SAT's introduction in  1901 , its name and scoring has changed several times. In 2005, the test was renamed as ""SAT Reasoning Test"" with possible scores from 600 to 2400 combining test results from three 800-point sections (math, critical reading, and writing), along with other subsections scored separately. Function         The College Board states that the SAT measures critical thinking skills that are needed for academic success in   college. They state that the SAT assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problems—skills they learned in school that they will need in college. The SAT is typically taken by   high school   juniors and   seniors. Specifically, the College Board states that use of the SAT in combination with high school grade point average (GPA) provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone, as measured by college freshman   GPA. Various studies conducted over the lifetime of the SAT show a statistically significant increase in  correlation  of high school grades and freshman grades when the SAT is factored in. There are substantial differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to American   federalism, local control, and the prevalence of private, distance, and   home schooled students.   ACT/SAT scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local data—such as course work, grades, and class rank—in a national perspective. Historically, the SAT has been more popular among colleges in the coasts and the ACT more popular in the Midwest and South. There are some colleges that require the ACT to be taken for college course placement, and a few schools that do not accept the SAT at all.  Structure         SAT consists of three major sections: Critical   Reading,  Mathematics , and  Writing . Each section receives a score on the scale of 200–800. All scores are multiples of 10. Total scores are calculated by adding up scores of the three sections. Each major section is divided into three parts. There are 10 sub-sections, including an additional 25-minute experimental or ""equating"" section that may be in any of the three major sections. The experimental section is used to   normalize questions for future administrations of the SAT and does not count toward the final score. The test contains 3 hours and 45 minutes of actual timed sections, although most administrations, including orientation, distribution of materials, and completion of the biographical sections, run about 4 hours (10–25 minutes per sub-section) long.                      Intentionally blank page in the style used in the SAT.                          Critical Reading         The Critical Reading, formerly verbal, section of the SAT is made up of three scored sections, two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, with varying types of questions, including sentence completions and questions about short and long reading passages. Critical Reading sections normally begin with 5 to 8 sentence completion questions; the remainder of the questions are focused on the reading passages. Sentence completions generally test the student's   vocabulary and understanding of sentence structure and organization by requiring the student to select one or two words that best complete a given sentence. The bulk of the Critical Reading questions is made up of questions regarding reading passages, in which students read short excerpts on social sciences, humanities, physical sciences, or personal narratives and answer questions based on the passage. Certain sections contain passages asking the student to compare two related passages; generally, these consist of short reading passages as well as longer passages. Since this is a timed test, the number of questions about each passage is proportional to the length of the passage. Mathematics         The  Mathematics  section of SAT is widely known as Quantitative Section. Mathematics section consists of three scored sections. There are two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, as follows:          One of the 25-minute sections is entirely multiple choice, with 20 questions. The other 25-minute section contains eight multiple choice questions and 10 grid-in questions. The shorter section is all multiple choice, with only 16 questions.         Notably, the SAT has done away with   quantitative comparison questions on the math section, leaving only questions with straightforward   symbolic or  numerical  answers. Since the quantitative comparison questions were well-known for their deceptive nature—often turning on the student's recognition of a single exception to a rule or pattern—this choice has been equated to a philosophical shift away from ""trickery"" and toward ""straight math"" on the SAT. Also, many test experts have attributed this change, like the addition of the new writing section, to an attempt to make the SAT more like the   ACT. Indeed, there is a correlation between ACT scores and SAT scores. Writing         The writing section of the SAT, based on but not directly comparable to the old SAT II subject test in writing, includes multiple choice questions and a brief essay. The multiple choice questions include error identification questions, sentence improvement questions, and paragraph improvement questions. Error identification and sentence improvement questions test the student's knowledge of grammar, presenting an awkward or grammatically incorrect sentence; in the error identification section, the student must locate the word producing the source of the error or indicate that the sentence has no error, while the sentence improvement section requires the student to select an acceptable fix to the awkward sentence. The paragraph improvement questions test the student's understanding of logical organization of ideas, presenting a poorly written student essay and asking a series of questions as to what changes might be made to best improve it. The essay section, which is always administered as the first section of the test, is 25 minutes long. All essays must be in response to a given prompt. The prompts are broad and often philosophical and are designed to be accessible to students regardless of their educational and social backgrounds. For instance, test takers may be asked to expound on such ideas as their opinion on the value of work in human life or whether technological change also carries negative consequences to those who benefit from it. No particular essay structure is required, and the College Board accepts examples ""taken from [the student's] reading, studies, experience, or observations."" Two trained readers assign each essay a score between 1 and 6, where a score of 0 is reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic, non-English, not written with a Number 2 pencil, or considered illegible after several attempts at reading. The scores are summed to produce a final score from 2 to 12 (or 0). If the two readers' scores differ by more than one point, then a senior third reader decides. The essay score accounts for roughly 30% of the writing score; the multiple choice component accounts for roughly 70%. Questions         Most of the questions on the SAT are   multiple choice; all multiple-choice questions have five answer choices, one of which is correct. The questions of each section of the same type are generally ordered by difficulty. However, an important exception exists: Questions that follow the long and short reading passages are organized chronologically, rather than by difficulty. Ten of the questions in one of the math sub-sections are not multiple choice. They instead require the test taker to bubble in a number in a four-column grid. The questions are weighted equally. For each correct answer, one raw point is added. For each incorrect answer one-fourth of a point is deducted. No points are deducted for incorrect math grid-in questions. This ensures that a student's   mathematically expected gain from guessing is zero. The final score is derived from the raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations. The SAT therefore recommends only making educated guesses, that is, when the test taker can eliminate at least one answer he or she thinks is wrong. Without eliminating any answers one's probability of answering correctly is 20%. Eliminating one wrong answer increases this probability to 25%; two, a 33.3% probability; three, a 50% probability of choosing the correct answer and thus earning the full point for the question.

The test is typically offered on the first Saturday of the month for the November, December, May, and June administrations. In other countries, the SAT is offered on the same dates as in the  United States  except for the first spring test date (i.e., March or April), which is not offered. In 2006, the test was taken 1,465,744 times. Candidates may either take the SAT Reasoning Test or up to three   SAT Subject Tests on any given test date, except the first spring test date, when only the SAT Reasoning Test is offered. Candidates wishing to take the test may register online at the College Board's website, by mail, or by telephone, at least three weeks before the test date. The SAT Subject Tests are all given in one large book on test day. Therefore, it is actually immaterial which tests, and how many, the student signs up for; with the possible exception of the language tests with listening, the student may change his or her mind and take  any  tests, regardless of his or her initial sign-ups. Students who choose to take more subject tests than they signed up for will later be billed by College Board for the additional tests and their scores will be withheld until the bill is paid. Students who choose to take fewer subject tests than they signed up for are not eligible for a refund. The SAT Reasoning Test costs $43 ($68 International). For the Subject tests, students pay a $20 Basic Registration Fee and $8 per test (except for language tests with listening, which cost $20 each). The College Board makes fee waivers available for low income students. Additional fees apply for late registration, standby testing, registration changes, scores by telephone, and extra score reports (beyond the four provided for free). Candidates whose religious beliefs prevent them from taking the test on a Saturday may request to take the test on the following Sunday, except for the October test date in which the Sunday test date is eight days after the main test offering. Such requests must be made at the time of registration and are subject to denial. Students with verifiable disabilities, including physical and learning disabilities, are eligible to take the SAT with accommodations. The standard time increase for students requiring additional time due to learning disabilities is 50%. Raw scores, scaled scores, and percentiles         Students receive their online score report approximately three weeks after administration of the test (six weeks for mailed, paper scores), with each section graded on a scale of 200–800 and two sub scores for the writing section: the essay score and the multiple choice sub score. In addition to their score, students receive their   percentile (the percentage of other test takers with lower scores). The raw score, or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers (ranges from just under 50 to just under 60, depending upon the test), is also included. Students may also receive, for an additional fee, the Question and Answer Service, which provides the student's answer, the correct answer to each question, and online resources explaining each question. The corresponding percentile of each scaled score varies from test to test—for example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both sections of the SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are because of the content of the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often in the form of an   AP, which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores. The percentiles that various SAT scores for college-bound seniors correspond to are summarized in the following chart:                    Percentile           Score, 1600 Scale  (official, 2006)           Score, 2400 Scale  (official, 2006)                             99.93/99.98*           1600           2400                             99+           ≥1550           ≥2300                             99           ≥1480           ≥2200                             98           ≥1450           ≥2140                             97           ≥1420           ≥2100                             88           ≥1380           ≥1900                             83           ≥1280           ≥1800                             78           ≥1200           ≥1770                             72           ≥1150           ≥1700                             61           ≥1090           ≥1600                             48           ≥1010           ≥1500                             36           ≥950           ≥1400                             15           ≥810           ≥1200                             4           ≥670           ≥1010                             1           ≥520           ≥790                             * The percentile of the perfect score was 99.98 on the 2400 scale and 99.93 on the 1600 scale.                          The older SAT (before 1995) had a very high ceiling. In any given year, only seven of the million test-takers scored above 1580. A score above 1580 was equivalent to the 99.9995 percentile. SAT-ACT score comparisons         Although there is no official conversion chart between the SAT and its biggest rival, the   ACT, the College Board released an unofficial chart based on results from 103,525 test takers who took both tests between October 1994 and December 1996   here; however, both tests have changed since then. Several colleges have also issued their own charts. The following is based on the University of California's conversion chart.

Although those taking the test came from a variety of backgrounds, approximately one third were from   New York,   New Jersey, or   Pennsylvania. The majority of those taking the test were from private schools, academies, or endowed schools. About 60% of those taking the test applied to   Columbia University. The test contained sections on English,  French ,  German ,  Latin ,   Greek, history, mathematics,  chemistry , and  physics . The test was not multiple choice, but instead was evaluated based on essay responses as ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""doubtful,"" ""poor,"" or ""very poor.""  1926 test         The first administration of the SAT occurred on   June 23,  1926 , when it was known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of   definitions,  arithmetic , classification, artificial language,   antonyms, number series,   analogies,   logical inference, and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to   Yale University and   Smith College respectively.  The test was paced considerably quickly, with 315 questions asked in only a little over an hour and a half. 1928 and 1929 tests         In 1928 the number of verbal sections was reduced to 7, and the time limit was increased to slightly under two hours. In 1929 the number of sections was again reduced, this time to 6. These changes in part loosened time constraints on test-takers. Math was eliminated entirely for these tests, instead focusing only on verbal ability. 1930 test and 1936 changes         In  1930  the SAT was first split into the verbal and math sections, a structure that would continue through  2004 . The verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range on content than its predecessors, examining only antonyms, double definitions (somewhat similar to sentence completions), and paragraph reading. In  1936 , analogies were re-added. Between 1936 and  1946 , students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions (over a third of which were on antonyms). The mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 free response questions to be answered in 80 minutes, and focused primarily on speed. From 1936 to  1941 , like the 1928 and 1929 tests, the mathematics section was eliminated entirely. When the mathematics portion of the test was re-added in  1942 , it consisted of multiple choice questions. 1946 test and associated changes         Paragraph reading was eliminated from the verbal portion of the SAT in 1946, and replaced with reading comprehension, and ""double definition"" questions were replaced with sentence completions. Between 1946 and  1957  students were given 90 to 100 minutes to complete 107 to 170 verbal questions. Starting in  1958  time limits became more stable, and for 17 years, until  1975 , students had 75 minutes to answer 90 questions. In  1959  questions on data sufficiency were introduced to the mathematics section, and then replaced with quantitative comparisons in  1974 . In 1974 both verbal and math sections were reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes each, with changes in test composition compensating for the decreased time. 1980 test and associated changes         The inclusion of the ""Strivers"" Score study was implemented. This study was introduced by The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT, and has been conducting research on how to make it easier for minorities and individuals who suffer from social and economic barriers. The original ""Strivers"" project, which was in the research phase from 1980 - 1994, awarded a test-taker who was identified as a minority an additional 10 - 200 points, depending on the race and gender. The belief was that this would give minorities a better chance at being accepted in to a college of higher standard, i.e. an Ivy League school. In 1992, the Strivers Project was leaked to the public; as a result the Strivers Project was terminated in 1993. After Federal Courts heard arguments from the ACLU, NAACP and the Educational Testing Service, the courts ordered the study to alter its data collection process, stating that only the age, race and zip code could be used to determine the test-takers eligibility for ""Strivers"" points. These changes were introduced to the SAT effective in 1994. 1994 changes         In  1994  the verbal section received a dramatic change in focus. Among these changes were the removal of   antonym questions, and an increased focus on passage reading. The mathematics section also saw a dramatic change in 1994, thanks in part to pressure from the   National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. For the first time since 1935, the SAT asked some non-multiple choice questions, instead requiring students to supply the answers. 1994 also saw the introduction of calculators into the mathematics section for the first time in the test's history. The mathematics section introduced concepts of probability, slope, elementary statistics, counting problems, median and mode. The average score on the 1994 modification of the SAT I was usually around 1000 (500 on the verbal, 500 on the math). The most selective schools in the United States (for example, those in the   Ivy League) typically had SAT averages exceeding 1400 on the old test. 2005 changes         In 2005, the test was changed again, largely in response to criticism by the   University of California system. Because of issues concerning ambiguous questions, especially   analogies, certain types of questions were eliminated (the analogies from the verbal and quantitative comparisons from the Math section). The test was made marginally harder, as a corrective to the rising number of perfect scores. A new writing section, with an essay, based on the former SAT II Writing Subject Test, was added, in part to increase the chances of closing the opening gap between the highest and midrange scores. Other factors included the desire to test the writing ability of each student in a personal manner; hence the essay. The New SAT (known as the SAT Reasoning Test) was first offered on   March 12,   2005, after the last administration of the ""old"" SAT in January of 2005. The Mathematics section was expanded to cover three years of high school mathematics. The Verbal section's name was changed to the Critical reading section. Name changes and recentered scores         In 1990, because of uncertainty about the SAT's ability to function as an   intelligence test, the name was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test. Finally, in 1994, the name was changed to simply SAT (with the   letters not standing for anything). Now the test is commonly referred to as the SAT Reasoning Test. The scoring categories are now the following: Reading, Math, Writing, and Essay. The essay has its own score now. The test scoring was initially scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section with a  standard deviation  of 100. As the test grew more popular and more students from less rigorous schools began taking the test, the average dropped to about 428 Verbal and 478 Math. The SAT was ""recentered"" in 1995, and the average ""new"" score became again close to 500. Scores awarded after 1994 and before October 2001 are officially reported with an ""R"" (e.g. 1260R) to reflect this change. Old scores may be recentered to compare to 1995 to present scores by using official College Board tables , which in the middle ranges add about 70 points to Verbal and 20 or 30 points to Math. In other words, current students have a 100 (70 plus 30) point advantage over their parents. Scoring problems of October 2005 tests         In March of 2006, it was announced that a small percentage of the SATs taken in October 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers being moist and not scanning properly, and that some students had received substantially erroneous scores. The College Board announced they would change the scores for the students who were given a lower score than they earned, but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores. The College Board decided not to change the scores for the students who were given a higher score than they earned. A lawsuit was filed in 2005 by about 4,400 students who received an incorrect low score on the SAT. The class-action suit was settled in August 2007 when The College Board and another company that administers the college-admissions test announced they would pay $2.85 million to over 4,000 students. Under the agreement each student can either elect to receive $275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she feels the damage was even greater. Criticism         Bias         A famous example of alleged bias in the SAT I is the   oarsman-  regatta analogy question. The object of the question was to find the pair of terms that have the relationship most similar to the relationship between ""runner"" and ""marathon"". The correct answer was ""oarsman"" and ""regatta"".                                                                             As depicted above, SAT scores vary according to race, income, and parental educational background.                          The question relied upon students knowing the meaning of the two terms, referring to a sport popular with the wealthy. Fifty-three percent (53%) of white students correctly answered the question, and 22% of black students did. Analogy questions have since been replaced by short reading passages. Dropping SAT         A few   liberal arts colleges have responded to this criticism by joining the   SAT optional movement. These colleges do not require the SAT for admission. In a 2001 speech to the   American Council on Education,   Richard C. Atkinson, then president of the   University of California, urged dropping the SAT Reasoning Test as a college admissions requirement:          ""Anyone involved in education should be concerned about how overemphasis on the SAT is distorting educational priorities and practices, how the test is perceived by many as unfair, and how it can have a devastating impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young students. There is widespread agreement that overemphasis on the SAT harms American education.""         In response to threats by the University of California to drop the SAT as an admission requirement, the College Entrance Examination Board announced the restructuring of the SAT, to take effect in March 2005, as detailed above. Essay         In 2005,   MIT Writing Director   Les Perelman plotted essay length versus essay score on the new SAT from released essays and found a high correlation between them. After studying 23 graded essays he found that the longer the essay was, the higher the score. He also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors. However, the official SAT guide for scorers state that the essays should be scored according to their quality of writing and not factual accuracy. The National Council of Teachers of English also criticize the 25-minute writing section of the test, arguing that the basic principles of writing encourage the revision of written material several times. They say that the amount of time allowed for the test pushes schools to develop a formulaic system of writing.

clueweb09-enwp01-84-19480	"                     SAT Subject Tests          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  SAT Subject test )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search            The  SAT Subject Tests  is the collective name for 20  multiple choice   standardized tests  given on individual subjects. A student typically chooses which tests to take depending upon  college  entrance requirements for the schools in which he or she is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as  Achievement Tests , and until January 2005, they were known as  SAT IIs ; they are still commonly known by these names. Every test is now a one-hour timed test. Historically, the exception to the one-hour time was the writing test, which was divided into a 20-minute  essay  question and a 40-minute multiple choice section; it was discontinued after January 2005.   A student may take up to three SAT Subject Tests on any given date. Most SAT subject tests are offered on the same dates as the regular  SAT , except for the March administration. The language tests with listening are generally available only once a year, in November. A calendar of test dates and registration deadlines can be found on  The College Board 's official website ( here ).

[ edit ]   Scoring and admissions   Each individual test is scored on a scale of 200 to 800; however, some of the tests are scored on such generous curves that it is impossible to get a 200; for example, on the Mathematics Level 2 test if someone gets every question wrong, he/she gets a score of about 310 depending on the version of the test. [ 4 ]  The one and only exception was the ELPT, which was scored on a scale of 901 to 999.   Prior to the first administration of the new SAT (which includes the writing section) in March 2005, some highly selective colleges required applicants to take three SAT Subject tests, including the writing test and two other tests of the applicant's choosing, in addition to the SAT. However, with writing now a standard component of the SAT I, most selective colleges recommend applicants to submit scores for any two SAT Subject tests. Engineering schools typically require Chemistry or Physics and prefer Math Level 2. A handful of the most competitive schools, such as  Harvard University  and  Princeton University , [ 5 ]  still require three Subject tests in addition to the three sections of the SAT. It is important to consult the school's website to find out more information about Subject test requirements.   Schools also vary with regard to their SAT Subject test requirements of students submitting scores for the  ACT  in place of the SAT: some schools consider the ACT an alternative to both the SAT and some SAT Subject tests, whereas others accept the ACT but require SAT Subject tests as well. Information about a school's specific test requirements can typically be found on its official website.   The College Board will send all scores on all SAT tests taken, including Subject Tests, whenever a student requests scores be sent to a school; the student cannot select which Subject Tests to send to a given institution.   In October 2002, the College Board decided to drop the ""score choice"" option for exams. They figured that it benefited wealthier students taking the exam who could afford to take it multiple times. Score choice means that scores are not released to colleges until the student approves the score (after seeing it).  [ 6 ]   As of the March 2009 test, test takers now have the ability to choose whether or not to send scores thus reinstating the ""score choice"" option.  [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Answer sheet   The answer sheet has room for 115 answers. 1-100 are Standard Multiple choice questions and 101-115 for 'relationship analysis questions', which are only used for the Chemistry exam. No test has more than 95 questions. The biology test is the only test to use 96-100; questions 1-60 are common to both the E and M tests, in addition, the E uses 61-80, and the M uses 81-100.

MLIC GMAT/GRE PREP ADVANTAGE:  Best training materials, best trainers, most training hours, and the best training methodology                    back to              top          WHY MLIC GMAT PREP COURSE IS THE BEST TRAINING OPTION :                      MLIC GMAT COURSES -- INDUSTRY-LEADING, SKILL-ENHANCING, AND GOAL-DRIVEN. SERIOUS COACHING, NOT SEMINARS. WE TRAIN YOU, NOT JUST FEED YOU SOME USELESS TRICKS    WHY ARE THE MLICETS GMAT TEST PREP COURSES             BETTER  than the GMAT prep courses offered by Kaplan GMAT Prep (KAPTEST), Princeton              Review, Veritas Prep, Manhattan GMAT, Manhattan Review, 800Score.com, Testmasters,Powerscore, and others? Also, VERITAS PREP's and MGMAT's deceptions uncovered.    MLIC GMAT advantage -- Best training materials, best MBA instructors,best training methodology, and the most training hours of any GMAT course out there.   For starters, we 'coach and train' you in the GMAT assessment areas, using the  latest GMAT problems . Our goal-driven GMAT preparation courses will teach you relevant concepts and procedures required to shoot for and achieve a GMAT score of better than 700. Unlike the tutorial sessions run by Kaplan GMAT, Veritas Elite Prep , Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, and Manhattan Review, the MLICETS GMAT coaching courses will show you what it takes to achieve a GMAT score of better than 700 and make you demonstrate to your instructor that you have acquired and honed the skills in all Score-critical concept and procedural areas of GMAT, and provide customized help in your areas of weakness. We at  MLIC  do not leave it up to you to learn on your own as Kaplan GMAT, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, and other me-too courses do.  We compel you to show us that you have learned and honed the GMAT-critical procedural and conceptual skills required to get a GMAT score in the 90th percentile or better. We at MLIC are so confident that our coaching methodology is effective that we are willing to back up our training with the industry-leading GMAT Score Guarantee.    If you are not convinced that MLICETS is the best GMAT preparation option that is available to you consider this: we offer  the most GMAT training course hours  of any GMAT or GRE prep course out there: The MLICETS Turbo-Prep GMAT course              features 40 hours of pre-GMAT-course work in the GMAT assessment areas,              42 hours of in-classGMAT-coaching support, and at least 40 hours of post-GMAT-course training involving additional               practice tests, and customzied exercises - For a whopping 120 hours of serious, no-nonsense GMAT training.  Compare this to the pitiful 18 to 27 hours of useless Q&A sessions offered by Kaplan Prep (KAPTEST), Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Manhattan Review, and other me-too GMAT prep programs. Veritas Elite GMAT prep company claims to offer between 36 and 42 hours of in-class training but have been known to scale back the number of in-class hours, as it did recently in Cincinnati, OH because its part-time instructor could not show up on Day 1. Do not be stood up; be wise and be trained -- choose MLIC.    All the other GMAT prep courses, such as the              GMAT prep classes offered by Kaplan GMAT (KapTest), Princeton Review, Manhattan Review, Manhattan GMAT, Powerscore, Testmasters, and others, are              essentially  Self-study  GMAT courses : They              throw a bunch of less-than-half-decent GMAT-like books at you, show you some strategies and tricks during their in-class sessions, and ask you to work on your own for the most part. Veritas Prep, even though it claims to offer 42 hours of in-class sessions including about 3.5 hours of break during the sessions, does not require you to attend all its sessions and is, in essence, a program that relies on you to work through its prep materials on your own.     KAPLAN GMAT TEST PREP  courses for the GMAT run typically 18 to 24 hours and use part-time student instructors some of whom may not have taken the actual GMAT. Kaplan Prep does not use real GMAT questions but instead uses its own 'made up' questions that rely excessively on cheap tricks that do not work most of the time, if at all. Kaplan instructors have been known to give the stock reply that 'Kaplan policy does not allow to teach you those problems or answer those questions.'  The adaptive format the GMAT is not conducive to use of test-taking skills that rely on 'back-solving' and on 'tricks'. If you take away the 6 hours spent on 'practice tests' at the beginning and at the end of the 'course', the actual time spent in in-class sessions with Kaplan may not be more than 12 to 18 hours. Kaplan's ""computer lab' is a joke.  Rather than give you the CD containing the tests and having you take them at your home or office, Kaplan creates the illusion that it is actually providing value for your prep dollars by having you show up at its 'computer lab' to play with some useless tests. No one gets better by taking useless tests. MLIC actually  trains  you in GMAT assessment areas using questions appearing at high difficulty levels so that you can shoot for and reach a score of better than 700    PRINCETON REVIEW GMAT  GMAT courses typically run for 24 hours, and uses franchised outlets over which it may not have any direct control.  Princeton Review also relies on part-time instructors, most of whom are students who may not have taken the actual GMAT, and excessively relies on tricks to 'crack the GMAT'. Its training courses are meant to teach you at the level of 'Joe Blogg' and not at a level that is required to reach a score of better than 700. Princeton Review, like Kaplan Test prep, does not use the actual GMAT questions and trains you using some phony, made-up problems that are not representative of real GMaT questions. In short, Princeton Review GMAT course can actually do you more harm than good by letting you work on questions and passages that are not close to the real GMAT. Any company that charges you an arm and leg for 24 hours of useless tutorials such as the ones offered by PR must be doing itself a favor, not you a favor. Be wise. Choose MLIC GMAT prep.    MANHATTAN GMAT  prep course appears to be the biggest ""all-lime-and-salt-no-tequila' outfit out there, offering paltry 24 hours of tricks based tutoring for U$1,440 (after adjusting for the 3 hours of break during the 9-sessions) and relying on part-time instructors most of whom are non-MBA's (the instructor who  teaches  Manhattan GMAT course in New York City majored in linguistics and is an aspiring Hollywood screen-play writer; another instructor runs a puppy-mill from his bathroom). MGMAT has been known to switch your in-class registration to its pricey and useless virtual class if it cannot get sufficient number of people to enroll in its courses. Manhattan GMAT in-class sessions also appear to be disorganized;  the instructor hops from Data Sufficiency to Critical Reasoning to Sentence Correction, all in the same session.  Manhattan GMAT appears to rely on same training methodology as Kaplan and Princeton Review do, and merely teaches you some tricks, shows you  you some 'key' problems to explain its tricks, and then lets you go to work on your own in  clueless serendipity . When you show up for the next session, your homework tasks may not be reviewed, no question and answer session held, and the likely non-MBA instructor will move on to another round of amuse-bouche - moving from Reading Comprehension tricks to Problem solving to whatever the heck the instructor feels like. This methodology is not conducive to helping you develop a solid grip on the GMAT assessment areas, and cannot be effective.  Manhattan GMAT is the  only  company on the block that does NOT believe that its training methodology works so much so that it does   NOT  offer any sort of  guarantee  to back up its training.  In fact, Manhattan GMAT has the philosophy that if you did not do well on the test, then you are to blame for not controlling your nerves or for not applying its tricks. As Tate Shafer, one of the non-MBA instructors for MGMAT put it, if you did not do well after Manhattan GMAT training with its tricks, then you alone are to blame for the debacle. Manhattan GMAT appears to be a hyped up 'take the money and run' operation out there in the marketplace, blaming the 'victim'. Its potential instructors are 'trained' by 'sitting in on' the courses 'taught' by other instructors for the most part. Then they are required to do an audition to show that they can rattle out the talking points to be anointed 'instructors for MGMAT'. MGMAT also requires that its trainee instructors  GUEST-TEACH  a class, using YOU as the guinea-pig for the training of someone who may not even be hired. Do you want to be used as guinea-pig by a company that does not back up its GMAT training with any sort of post-course guarantees? MGMAT's claim that it hires only those who have scored in the 99th percentile on a GMAT test after rejecting 4 out of 5 aspirants sounds fraudulent. Firstly, 99th percentile scorers wanting to teach for MGMAT is not unlimited, and it does not have the luxury of rejecting 4 out of 5 aspiring teachers. Secondly, why are MGMAT's '99th percentile instructors' waiting for their gigs in Broadway or in Hollywood instead of pursuing MBA education at top-5 schools that will surely put them on the path to over $200,000 annual compensation? Let us do the math: MGMAT pays them, if they are 'hired',  $2,700 over a 9 week period, an average of $1,200 a month, which is not enough to pay the rent and buy Starbucks Coffee at the same time in Manhattan. Do you want to be taught by untrained, ill-qualified, and possibly some-months-behind-in-rent MGMAT instructors, when you shell out $1450 for its 24-hour long  dog-and-pony show  that passes for GMAT preparation? GMAT tests critical reasoning - Think critically and do not be suckered into buyng the phony claims by MGMAT. In sum, Manhattan GMAT offers you 24 hours of 'tricks' sessions,  does not believe in its training methodology to offer you a guarantee of any kind , offers no training in pacing critical to doing well in a time-critical GMAT environment, and features sloppy in-class training schedule that jerks you around from one GMAT section to another.  In Contrast, MLIC offers you 120-hours of goal-driven and skill-enhancing GMAT prep courses that are backed by the industry-leading GMAT Score Guarantee™.  Be informed. Be smart. Choose MLIC for serious, no-nonsense, kick-ass coaching in GMAT assessment areas.       VERITAS ELITE GMAT PREP  appears to be the  state of the art  in  ultimate deception . Its GMAT course materials are recycled retired GMAT questions, and its practice tests are the same ones you can buy from 800Score.com and Arco. Veritas Prep makes blatantly fraudulent claims on its website as explained below, and you should think twice before enrolling in its hyped up but useless GMAT courses. Veritas is also the only GMAT prep company that hires its 'instructors' mostly on the basis of resumes and phone interviews, and sends them out to teach with no formal training. Veritas recruits its part-time, hourly-rates-paid instructors by running ads in forums such as Craig's list  with the nonchalance of people who post ads for 'casual encounters' and in Vault job boards, and does not require that its instructors have 'teaching experience' (although it simply 'prefers it').  Veritas' training involves having its potential instructors watch a video of its methodology and then show up to 'teach' the class. MLIC believes that such a recruitment and training process used by Veritas Prep cannot ensure the quality of training that it claims that it delivers.  Veritas Prep also makes claims on its web-site that are  provably false . Let us expose four of those deceptions:    VERITAS DECEPTION 1 : Veritas Prep cleverly mentions '99th percentile' against the names of 'its faculty' appearing on its web-page. It does not state that they have scored in the 99th percentile on the GMAT. They could have scored in the 99th percentile on the SAT or on the LSAT or in one of the two assessment sections of the GMAT. The company's ad in Craig's list (that appears with the regularity of postings by a  pretentious  guy who cannot hold on to his girl friends) merely requires of its potential instructors a 99th percentile score in any of the GMAT sections. Participants who took Veritas Prep's GMAT course at Tysons Corner, Virginia recently have reported that the instructor who taught the course admitted to the class that he had not taken the GMAT ever. Other participants who took the Veritas course in Philadelphia recently have reported that the instructor who taught the course claimed that he had scored 740 on the GMAT, a score that is not sufficient to place him the 99th percentile. The instructor who taught the Cincinnati OH class that was canceled on the Day 1 because the instructor was a no-show stated that he had scored in the 80th percentile on the GMAT. Therefore, Veritas may be  fraudulently advertising  that its instructors have all scored in the 99th percentile on the GMAT. The 'faculty' list posted on its website may be outdated, and may include the names of 'instructors' who may not be currently 'teaching' for the company.    VERITAS DECEPTION 2 :  Veritas  falsely  characterizes its 'attendance policy' as 'score guarantee'.  The only GMAT prep company that offers GMAT Score Guarantee™ is MLICETS. Veritas Prep does not guarantee any score but merely allows you to retake its sessions once for any reason. Veritas Prep is also the only company that does not require you to attend all its training sessions. The only inference we can draw from this policy is that Veritas Prep is more interested in your money than in training you for the GMAT. If it were serious about training you, it would insist that you attend all its sessions. MLIC is the only GMAT prep company that actively teaches you the core concepts and procedures, makes you demonstrate that you have mastered them, and helps you improve in your areas of weakness by actively coaching you.  MLIC beats Veritas Prep hands down.   VERITAS DECEPTION 3 :  Veritas Prep blatantly makes a fraudulent claim about its association with GMAC®, (Graduate Management Admission Council), the body that administers the GMAT® test. Veritas Prep claims: ""Veritas works with the makers of the GMAT, the Graduate Management Admissions Council, and updates its course materials four times per year.""  GMAC® has flatly denied any such association and is proceeding against Veritas for this and other falsities represented on its website. Beware of phony and bald claims by Veritas. How could a company run by Yale MBA's and a JD from Missouri be obtuse enough to think that its fraud will not be caught? Any company that patently and blatantly makes false and fraudulent representations about its activities does not deserve your money or your time.  Beware of Veritas scams.  Choose industry-leading MLIC GMAT prep courses.    VERITAS DECEPTION 4 : Veritas Prep claims that if offers 13 practice tests. It basically 'buys' the tests from 800Score.com, Arco, and Cambridge tests,and uses some retired GMAT tests to 'arm' you with the practice tests. Of Veritas practice tests, 2 are available for free from GMAC at www.mba.com, 6 are available for $18.95 at Cambridge Ed, 5 are available for $24.95 at 800score.com, and 2 are available for about $5.00 from ARCO. There are no other eritaspractice tests aside from the ones available from these sources.   The tests created by 800Score.com are the same tests the company created 5 years ago, with no changes or updates. Veritas' claim that it 'updates' its tests 4 times a year is an utterly fraudulent statement, never mind its fraudulent claim of 'working with GMAC' for such updates. Veritas is the slimy spiderman caught with his hands in the cookie jar.  Any company that lies to get your business does not deserve your business. Beware of phony and fraudulenet claims by Veritas Prep. People who have been Veritas instructors report that they had to teach the 'same old same old' for years, with no updates. Veritas Prep pulls a fast one on you and does not deserve your business.    VERITAS CLASS SIZE -- NOT GOOD FOR YOU : Veritas classes may have as many as 15 to 25 persons in a class. MLIC classes will never have more than 10 persons per class. Crowded classrooms such as the ones offered by Veritas are not fair to you, especially when you pay $1,500. Beware of some of the false claims that Veritas makes on its website.    VERITAS PREP METHODOLOGY : Veritas Prep in-class sessions run like this: If the instructor shows up as scheduled, then he or she will do 'Q&A' for the first 20 to 30 minutes. Then he or she will teach you some strategies, and then have you work with him or her through some 'key' problems (usually about 8 to 10, sometimes as few as 4 to 5) and then you are dismissed to go home and do whatever the heck you want. There will not be any timed practice tests. There will be no effort made to identify and rectify your weaknesses in GMAT-critical areas. If you are willing to pay $1,500 for Veritas Prep course, you have a right to expect pro-active coaching support in GMAT-critical areas. Veritas Prep is also known to scale back its training hours to 'accommodate' its uncommitted, untrained, part-time instructors (Veritas Prep scaled back the weekend class hours from 21 to 18 at Cincinnati, OH to accommodate its instructor who could not show up on Day 1 of the course). When it comes to GMAT coaching, no one beats MLIC GMAT Turboprep™ course!    Veritas Prep does not provide any training in pacing or managing time during their in-class sessions. Any training that does not coach you in the pacing under time-critical GMAT testing environment is not doing you a service. MLIc trains you in pacing and gives you specific help in working under time-critical GMAT Conditions.     Be informed and be smart -- Choose MLIC GMAT prep courses that offer full-time MBA instructors, and proactively coaches you in GMAT-critical areas, and backs up its training with industry-leading GMAT Score Guarantee™ MLIC trains more people per month in the major markets than any other company -- Kaplan, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas Prep, Testmasters, and others.    MLIC GMAT PREP ADVANTAGE --  GET TRAINED, NOT JUST FED SOME USELESS TRICKS .       In short, Kaplan GMAT prep, Princeton Review, Manhattan Review, Manhattan GMAT, 800Score.com, Testmasters, and Veritas Elite GMAT prep courses are nothing but              tutorial sessions that do not address your conceptual understanding              of or your weaknesses in the GMAT assessment areas. Only the  MLICETS GMAT prep courses  offered in New York (NYC), London England, Frankfurt Germany, Munich, Singapore, Mumbai, Sydney, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Philadelphia, and worldwide             are based on              patent-pending  CPSD methodology  that uniquely helps you develop strong GMAT-specific             conceptual understanding, trains you in efficient PROCEDURES for              maximizing your GMAT test-effectiveness in a timed-environment, gives you              works-every-time STRATEGIES for picking the Correct response to all GMAT problems each              and every time, and features real-time and GMAT-prep-course-participant-specific DIAGNOSTIC evaluation of your unique              weaknesses so that you can be helped to overcome your deficiencies in GMAT sections             and to shoot for a GMAT Score in the top 10%.  All our GMAT prep courses are              taught by full-time employees, who are MBA graduates from reputed Ivy League             Business Schools such as Columbia, Stanford, Harvard, London Business School, INSEAD, etc. and who are              required to take the GMAT test at least once each year and score in the              98th percentile or better each time.     Be sure to consider 5 factors in choosing your GMAT prep course:  (1) Quality of in-class instructions and Instructors -- MLIC beats all other me-too courses hands down in this department. MLIC GMAT courses are taught by MBA graduates who have extensive consulting and teaching experience, and who are required to take the GMAT at least once a year and score in the 98th percentile or better;  (2) In-Class Training hours --  MLIC offers 42 hours in their Turboprep GMAT courses and 24 hours in their 3-day intensive prep courses (which is more than offered by courses such as those offered by Kaplan).   (3) Quality of Study and Training materials  --  MLIC GMAT study guides and training materials are frequently updated to incorporate changes to the GMAT testing and to included newer types of GMAT questions appearing in the more recent tests. (4)  Committed support before, during, and after the in-class GMAT training -- MLIC offers a total of 120 hours of training and provides the committed and industry-leading support right from the moment you sign up to the time you take the test.  MLIC cares for you and wants to ensure that you achieve a score of at least 650; (5) Size of GMAT prep classes.  Veritas admits as many as they can register, and they claim that their classes in major cities have about 20 students.  Crowded groups do not allow instructors to identify weaknesses that the participants demonstrate. In contrast, MLIC courses are capped at 10 students, and most classes typically have 6-8 students per class. This small, compact group size allows us to apply our  CPSD  methodology and to  coach you  in the GMAT assessment areas. Enroll in the industry-leading MLICETS GMAT prep courses today!

VERITAS DECEPTIONS REDUX: Veritas Elite GMAT prep may scale back the number of training hours to accommodate its part-time, uncommitted instructors, as evidenced by an episode in Cincinnati, OH where Veritas Prep cut back the prep hours to 18 hours from 21 hours. In fact, the company sent email messages about the cancellation at 4 p.m. on the starting day of the class, and the 4 participants were stood up and left high and dry.   Veritas also fraudulently characterizes its 'retake the course for any reason' policy as a 'score guarantee'. Veritas Prep does not guarantee any specific GMAT score as MLIC does. Participants in Veritas' Weekend course in Vienna, VA have called to report that the instructor Ken Kleinfeld admitted to the clas that he had not taken the GMAT and that he was offering private tutoring sessions in North Carolina for SAT. Therefore, Veritas may also be fraudulently advertising that its instructors have all scored in the 99th percentile.  Be informed. Be smart. Choose MLIC GMAT prep courses for no-nonsense, kick-ass, and serious coaching in GMAT assessment areas.     Manhattan GMAT offers 24 hours of in-class 'tricks' sessions that are taught by mostly non-MBA instructors. Manhattan GMAT (MGMAT) is the only GMAT prep company that does not believe that its training methodology is effective and, consequently, does not offer any guarantee. MGMAT has also been known to switch your registration in a class-room GMAT course to its expensive but useless GMAT VIRTUAL COURSE, if sufficient number of people do not enroll in its courses.

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE NEW REGISTRATION PROCEDURE FOR GMAT TESTING EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006 AND TO LEARN ABOUT THE IMPORTANT CHANGES TO GMAT TESTING AND GMAT TEST SCORE REPORTING EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. NEW! STANFORD WILL ACCEPT GRE SCORES FOR MBA ADMISSIONS. HARVARD AND PRINCETON WILL NOT HAVE EARLY ADMISSION PROCEDURE STARTING 2007.             Stanford Graduate School of Business has announced that it will accept GRE or GMAT Scores for admission consideration starting with the Fall 2007 admission to its MBA class.  The reason appears to be that Stanford fears that minorities, women, and other ethnic groups may be deterred from Business School Admission and may seek alternative opportunities in law and medicine.  Rather than accept lower GMAT scores from these otherwise excluded groups, the school may have decided to accept GRE (Graduate Record Examination) Scores in order to maintain the School average and median scores for the GMAT.  Sounds like a clever move by Stanford GSB. We wonder whether other Graduate Schools of Business may follow suit or stick to their GMAT Score requirement.   Schools such as Harvard and Princeton University have already announced that they will eliminate early admission deadlines starting with the 2007 admission season.  The reason, again, appears to be that early admission deadlines favor strong candidates and leave the not-so-strong to be rejected when they apply late. Schools desire to have diversity, with participation by hitherto under-represented groups.      GMAT TEST REGISTRATION PROCEDURE FOR THE PEARSON VUE GMAT EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2006 AND IMPORTANT CHANGES TO GMAT TESTING AND GMAT SCORE REPORTING:   As far as GMAT TM  is concerned, ETS TM  is history and nobody is shedding any tears over the divorce. Pearson Vue and ACT is the new 800 pound gorilla in the room now and you better get used to it. You should know about some significant changes to GMAT testing and GMAT Test Score Reporting effective January 1, 2006. Pearson Vue is the Electronic testing divison of Pearson Educational Measurement (PEM) group, which administers several standardized tests including the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT-Reasoning Test) for College Board tm .  PEARSON EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT   is in the midst of unanticipated controversy surrounding its handling of the Scoring of the October 2005 SAT test. Some 4000 of the close to 500,000 test-takers received score reports that under-reported their total SAT Scores by as many as 400 out of 2400 points. Pearson ED, the group of which Pearson Vue is a member, said in a news release, ""SAT errors , which affected 4,000 students out of 495,000 who took that test, arose in part because of excessive moisture that caused the answer sheets to expand before they were scanned at its large Texas test-processing site. Another factor, PearsonEd said, was that its scanners were not picking up some lightly marked answers on the SAT answer sheet. The company, Pearson Educational Measurement (PEM), said in a statement that it was taking steps to make sure that ""this unfortunate situation will not happen again."" The latest news is that the executives at Pearson Educational Measurement are being called to testify before the U.S.A congress and explain why the scoring snafu did not make the testing company liable for messing up the admission and scholarship prospects for thousands of high-school graduates who took the SAT Reasoning test. What does this episode mean for the GMAT test-takers, who take the test on the computer? Nothing at all, we hope. The Scoring of computer adaptive or computer based test does not involve scanning sheets of paper that can stick to one another, and is more reliable.  (Are we guilty of assuming that the computer will not mess up the scoring by going berserk?) Let us keep our fingers crossed, shall we?     The paper and pencil format of GMAT is now dead. GMAT is administered worldwide in Computer Adaptive Testing format only.    Walk-in registrations for GMAT Testing are no longer permitted. Prior appointments must be made for GMAT testing in all testing centers. You can register to take the test by following the Telephonic registration procedure described below or by logging on to  GMAT TEST REGISTRATION ONLINE .    GMAT testing will not be offered on Saturdays and Sundays. Prometric used to offer GMAT testing on the Weekend days, including Sundays, in some cities. Pearson Vue would like to observe the Sabbath on Saturdays and Sundays. Register early in order to firm up your testing date.   GMAT test centers will no longer offer  scratch paper  during the GMAT testing. Instead, you will receive TWO dry erase  NOTE BOARDS and a PEN  that must be returned to the proctor at the GMAT test center when you leave or when you request a change of note-board. This is not a big deal but the earlier strategy of writing down (on scratch paper) formulas in Math will not work. You will be better off remembering all formulas and rules before you head to the testing center.   Test takers will no longer have to wait two to three weeks to get their official score reports by mail. Theyl be able to access their GMAT test score reports and send Official GMAT Score reports to schools through a secure online system.  GMAC will, at least for the forseeable future,  offer aper in a Pinchscore reports for those who don have access to a computer. GMAC (Graduate Management Admission Council) will not charge a fee for this paper-based score reporting service until further advise.    When ETS was administering the GMAT, the official GMAT Score Report contained the last three scores on the GMAT taken in the past. Effective January 2006, Pearson Vue and ACT will report  ALL GMAT SCORES  obtained during the past 5 years. This is a significant change because the Graduate Schools of Business will know your GMAT Score history during a longer period and because you will not be able to 'wipe off' the record a GMAT score that you want to forget about.   The format of the GMAT will remain the same, and the GMAT test will continue to measure your skill in the three different assessment areas: GMAT Quantitative Assessment, GMAT Verbal Assessment, and GMAT Analytical Writing Assessment. The Analytical Writing Section will continue to receive a separate score on the same scale between 2.0 and 6.0; the two adaptive sections on the GMAT, the quantitative assessment and the verbal assessment, will each receive scaled scores (0 to 60) as before, and the TOTAL score on the GMAT will remain 800. The GMAT test-scores on the multiple-choice, adaptive sections(Verbal and Quantitative Sections) will be based on the number of questions answered within the allotted time.    COSMETIC CHANGES   The GMATexam will go through some cosmetic changes as a result of the transition from ETSto Pearson Vue    The font and background color on the screen will change for the better   GMAT Reading Comprehension questions that point to specific sections of the reading passage will direct you to look at highlighted sections, not underlined sections as was the case in the past.    You will be given two (2) erasable noteboards and a pen when you enter the GMAT testing room instead of scratch paper and a pencil. The Verbal and Quantitative sections will remain Computer Adaptive, with the difficulty level of the GMATtesting constantly adjusting to your comfort level as demonstrated through your responses to the GMATquestions.

""I had taken the Kaplan GMAT prep before I took the MLIC prep class in Los Angeles. I found the Kaplan method insulting and insufficient to help me feel confident. The MLIC course, on the other hand, was intense, and helped me understand my weaknesses. I also received patient help from the instructor who was professional, highly skilled, and full of humor. All in all, a worthwhile investment.

""A friend of mine lent me his Manhattan GMAT study notes and I worked through them before I took the test in March 2008. I scored a 540 and was totally disapponted after having scored close to 700 on the MGMAT tests. Then, I enrolled in MLIC course for GMAT in New York in April 2008. When I received the pre-course assignments that included the study guides, I was struck by the detail and depth of coverage of GMAT concepts and test-taking procedures that were included in their prep materials. My score improved to 720 after taking the MLIC class in Manhattan. I strongly recommend the MLIC GMAT prep and would like to add this caveat:  Their pre-course assignments take about 60-70 hours, not 40 hours as they had claimed. Allow sufficient time to work through them before the class.           --  Erika Sweeney , GMAT PREP Course, New York, April  2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 06/08 .""

In fact, I received the same topic for the argument essay that we discussed during the prep class, and your quantitative training in the areas of sequences, coordinate geometry, and probability were of great help when I took the test. I also found your training for the sentence correction extremely useful: I learnt that sentence correction on the GMAT is not only about grammar and idiom rules but also about rules of logic. MLIc prep is the best.           --  Qamar Toor  , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, New York, April 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 05/08 .""

My major weakness was in the Verbal sections and MLIC's strategies for eliminating answer choices by classifying them into hit list categories helped me with a scaled score of 42 in the verbal section.

The biggest difference I found between the Manhattan GMAT course and the MLIC Turboprep course is this: Manhattan GMAT study materials do not cover the GMAT concepts as thoroughly as MLIC study guides do. Secondly, Manhattan GMAT makes you work through the OG 10, which contains retired GMAT problems.  The actual test is very different from the types covered in the official Guide for GMAT review. What I liked best about MLIC course was their study guides and their strategies for answer selection particularly in the verbal section.

When I signed up to do your turboprep class, I found what I needed but did not realize: a guided tour of the various assessment areas. The in-class instructor was brilliant, and showed us how the different areas of the GMAT are about the same logical reasoning skills. The drilling in procedural aspects of the Gmat, especially in data sufficiency, and the hit list approach to eliminating answer choices gave me the effective tools I needed to do well on this test. I am happy to report a score of 740 on the Gmat exam which I took 10 days after your class. The score is sufficient to make me competitive at INSEAD. Your prep course works.

Your GMAT course is the best for the following reasons:  (1) your study materials are the most thorough I have seen of any prep materials for the GMAT I have worked through; (2) The quality of in-class training was outstanding. The instructor was knowledgeable and patient; and (3) the course had a great structure, with the pre-class training assignments providing the required exposure to the concepts tested on the GMAT.

""Following your GMAT Turboprep course in Manhattan, I took the GMAT on June 27th, and scored a 680 (a huge 230 point improvement from the 450 I was making in the practice tests after I took the Veritas Elite prep course), landing myself in the 89th percentile. I also scored a  5.5 on the AWA section for 87th percentile ranking. Your GMAT prep course was a major factor in my success, and I must thank you for the thorough preparation you offered. I believe that I now have a competitive shot at admission to Columbia Business school.     As you are aware, I took the Veritas Elite GMAT course in Washington D.C. in Oct/Nov. 2005, and I felt that the Veritas Elite  Prep course lacked the necessary tools and methodology that could help me successfully prepare for the GMAT test.  When I first received your pre-class GMAT training files, I realized that your GMAT course was undoubtedly better than that offered by Veritas Elite! Although the majority of the information i had studied did not show up on the test, I felt prepared to deal with any problem that could have been thrown at me.  Veritas only prepared me for the most common problems which could be asked.  I also want to let you know that the incredible detail you pack into each GMAT study and training file allowed me to prepare for each GMAT section in the required depth.  Veritas Prep just put out some stuff out there and forced you to memorize concepts, hoping its crash course would provide enough of the tools necessary to solve most of the problems.   Veritas prep materials also lacked the depth and quality of training that MLIC offered. I strongly recommend MLIC GMAT prep course to anyone serious about getting a score in the 90th percentile range. Thanks again.

After scoring 570 on the GMAT in my first attempt, I researched on the Internet GMAT prep courses and enrolled in the GMAT prep class offered by an American testpreparation Company, MLIC, New York. MLIC GMAT preparation course, besides offering excellent GMAT study and GMAT training materials, also reinforces the learning process with original GMAT questions. The individual attention received from dedicated instructor in the MLIC GMAT class helps one overcome his or her weakness in Mathematics and in Verbal areas of GMAT. Result: I scored 670 on the GMAT.

WHAT IS GMAT® CAT?                  GMAT® , acronym for  G raduate  M anagement  A dmission  T est, is administered by Pearson Vue® on behalf of GMAC® and is required by all  G raduate  S chools of  B usiness for admission purposes.               The GMAT, according to  GMAC                (Graduate Management Admission Council that owns the trademarks GMAT®  and GMAT CAT®, is one measure of your ability to               complete sucessfully the first year of graduate study program (MBA degree program) at a Graduate School of Business.However, effective January 2006, the paper and pencil version of the GMAT test is no longer offered anywhere in the world. GMATis              administered in a CAT(Computer Adaptive) format in which the GMAT test'adapts' the              difficulty level of GMAT questions to your GMAT-specific 'comfort level', with 'higher              difficulty level GMAT questions' carrying higher GMAT raw scores (GMAT Scaled              Scores) than do 'lower difficulty level' GMAT questions. The              GMAT tests your Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning skills, and your ability (i) to process information in context, (ii) to make necessarily true and probable interpretations of information presented, (iii) to stay focused on the specifics, and (iv) to test different scenarios for consistency of decisions. The GMAT test also is about your ability to determine whether GMAT sentences are logically, clearly, correctly, and effectively written.  The GMAT  has three              assessment areas:    AWA  (Analytical Writing Assessment)              that requires you to write Two essays, one analyzing an Issue              and the other analyzing an Argument. This first essay section on the GMAT is not 'adaptive'              and receives a separate score of between 0 and 6.   GMAT Quantitative Assessment  is the first              of the two 'adaptive' sections on the GMAT and follows the Analytical Writing section, and requires that you              answer 37 questions in problem solving and in Data Sufficiency in 75 minutes (nearly 1/4 of the questions will not be scored). Following the GMAT Quantitative section, you will be required to work on the last 'adaptive' section on              the GMAT is  Verbal              Assessment , which requires that you answer 41              questions in 75 minutes. The GMAT Verbal assessment includes three sections: GMAT Critical Reasoning, GMAT Sentence Correction, and GMAT Reading Comprehension. GMAT adaptive sections also include              experimental questions, at least 9 in GMAT Quantitative assessment and 11              in GMAT Verbal assessment. The two adaptive sections on the GMAT receive a combined             score of between 200 and 800. Most A-List Business Schools rated in the top-10 will              require a GMAT test score of at least 680 in order for you to be              competitive. (the percentile rankings corresponding to scores of between 600 and 640 have decreased in the past few years). Your best chance for success lies in your ability to              take the GMAT exam at the high difficulty level throughout and to score better than 700. The MLICETS GMAT prep              courses offer the best GMAT test training, using the  most recent and high difficulty level questions that are live on the GMAT  so that              you can competently and confidently take the GMAT test in a timed-environment, and achieve a score of better than 700.

CONTENTS OF THIS SITE       Testimonials      COURSE STRUCTURE         GMAT Score Guarantee™     MLIC is the best GMAT prep option             TESTIMONIALS ABOUT MLIC GMAT COURSES   ""Half way through the Veritas prep program and frustrated with the haphazard training methodology used by Chris, I enrolled in the MLIC GMAT prep course in Manhattan. Right from the time I received the precourse assignments, I could already see why MLIC was far superior. The training guides provided by MLIC were the best I have worked through, and the in-class instructions were the most thorough:  Veritas instructor would randomly choose a few problems from their workbooks and OG, and hurriedly show how they would be solved. After class assignments were hardly reviewed, and I had to work on my own in clueless frustration. In contrast, MLIC instructor covered all concept areas, strategies, and explained all in-class tests and home assignments. Some of the critical areas such as sequences and conditional probability were never covered in any dept in the Veritas program whereas MLIC did a great job. MLIC prep was worth the time and additional money I paid for it.          --  SH, New York Turboprep GMAT course    ""I was working through some nondescript books for GMAT and was getting frustrated, not knowing what specifically I needed to know to ace this test before I registered in your course. Your course gave me a structure that was important to my learning style, and got me prepped in all the maths basics that I had initially struggled with. Your prework files (that took me 70 hours to work through against your claim of 50 hours) was nevertheless useful in giving me a brushup on the basics in maths and getting me ready for the programme. Your inclass training was equally effective. I scored an impressive 680 after your training. Cheers, MLIC.""          --  Colin Cowdrey, London Turboprep course  ""I took your turboprep course after participating in Veritas gmat course, and found your training exponentially better. The study materials were far superior and covered the gmat sections more comprehensively, and your in-class instructions were a thousand times better than I had seen with Veritas. For example, Veritas showed a few sample problems during the in-class sessions and let me work on my own with their question bank. When I showed up in the next class, there was no review of homework problems. MLIC, on the other hand, gave all of us after-class home assignments and reviewed all of it during the following day. The instructor was a professional and was patient in helping us understand difficult concepts such as sequences and functions, which were never discussed at any length in Veritas program and which actually showed up on my test. I have no reservation in recommending MLIC gmat course.          --  KPJ, Los Angeles, CA    ""I orderd your  MLIC study guides for GMAT , and was quite pleasantly surprised by the quality and the extent of coverage of GMAT concepts. The bonus practice exercises that were supplied contained questions that were very similar to the actual GMAT problems that I faced when I took the test. My score improved from 630 to 740 after working through your study guides. Thanks, MLIC!""           --  Raman Unnikrishnan , Singapore.   ""I took the Manhattan GMAT course before enrolling in your Turboprep course. When I worked through Manhattan GMAT program and the OG they provided, I was slightly offended and felt that I was paying nearly $1,500 for the $20 OG11 for GMAT that I could have bought at Barnes and Noble or Amazon. The OG11 has problems that were old and all problems were explained; I did not have to go through Manhattan GMAT to have them walk me through the same explanations. But I did and guess I was not thinking straight. MLIC trained me with newer types of questions and actually had me show them that I have all the concepts and procedures buttoned up. The difference is this: My score after MGMAT was 540; after MLIC, it was 690. MLIC is exceptional value for GMAT prep.          --  Rick Granja , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, New York, August 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 09/08 .""   ""I took the GMAT 3 times and consistently scored between 47 and 50 in the math section. My downfall was verbal section. Frustrated, I enrolled in MLIC Turboprep course in Chicago, and learned that there is a technique to reading passages and dealing with the critical reasoning section. Your training on what aspects of passages I should focus on helped me improve my verbal scaled score from 29 to 41. My total score improved from 640 to 740. Your training made the difference. Thanks, MLIC.           --  Annika Thomas  , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, Chicago, Sept. 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 10/08 .""   ""I ordered your study guides before I enrolled in your GMAT prep course in Chicago. I must say that your guides far exceeded my expectations. Your sentence correction module 3 was the best I have seen, covering all bases including parallelism, logical comparisons, positioning of qualifers and modifers, etc. The anchor phrase strategy for Rc and the section about how to determine the best answer even without reading the passage were truly helpful. Your in-class training was just as I expected -- professional and very relevant. Some of the questions in your Workbooks used in the program actually showed up on the test. I owe my 700 on the GMAT to your outstanding training.           --  Elizabeth Sweeney , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, Chicago May 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 07/08 .""

""Thank you very much for a great prep course for the GMAT. Before I took your course, I had worked through several books available in book stores to no avail. When I signed up to do your turboprep class, I found what I needed but did not realize: a guided tour of the various assessment areas. The in-class instructor was brilliant, and showed us how the different areas of the GMAT are about the same logical reasoning skills. The drilling in procedural aspects of the Gmat, especially in data sufficiency, and the hit list approach to eliminating answer choices gave me the effective tools I needed to do well on this test. I am happy to report a score of 740 on the Gmat exam which I took 10 days after your class. The score is sufficient to make me competitive at INSEAD. Your prep course works. Cheers.""           --  Matthew Hanwell , GMAT TURBOPREP Course, LONDON, November 2007--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 12/07 ."" ""I took your GMAT Turboprep course in London recently, and thought that you might want to know that I got a score of 720 on the GMAT. Your Gmat prep materials were detailed and explained all high level concepts well, and your in-class training was intense and extremely beneficial. Your Gmat training methods work. Thanks for your support.          --  Jesus De La Ortiz , GMAT PREP Course, London, August 2007--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 09/07 .""    ""I had taken the Veritas Prep course in Chicago and was totally annoyed with the poor quality of instructors. I then registered in the MLIC course and can vouch for the professionalism of the training programs. The structured way to GMAT preparation helped me better prepared and the teaching materials were top notch too. My major weakness was in the Verbal sections and MLIC's strategies for eliminating answer choices by classifying them into hit list categories helped me with a scaled score of 42 in the verbal section. I scored 740 on the GMAT after MLIC prep. Thanks, MLIC.          --  Sou K. Marty,  , GMAT PREP Course, Chicago, January 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 02/2008 .""    ""I took the MLIC prep class in Munich during April 2008 and my friend registered to take the Veritas prep weekend course. Sadly, Veritas prep canceled their classes because they had just one person registered. MLIC course went ahead with 7 participants. The course was intensive and put us through the paces in terms of techniques and concepts. I found the verbal drills particularly useful to me. I scored a 690 when I took the test on the 25th, barely three days after the class. Thanks, MLIC!          -- Stefanja Matonis  , GMAT PREP Course, Munich, April 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 05/2008 .""   ""Following your GMAT Turboprep course in Manhattan, I took the GMAT on June 27th, and scored a 680 (a huge 230 point improvement from the 450 I was making in the practice tests after I took the Veritas Elite prep course), landing myself in the 89th percentile. I also scored a  5.5 on the AWA section for 87th percentile ranking. Your GMAT prep course was a major factor in my success, and I must thank you for the thorough preparation you offered. I believe that I now have a competitive shot at admission to Columbia Business school.     As you are aware, I took the Veritas Elite GMAT course in Washington D.C. in Oct/Nov. 2005, and I felt that the Veritas Elite  Prep course lacked the necessary tools and methodology that could help me successfully prepare for the GMAT test.  When I first received your pre-class GMAT training files, I realized that your GMAT course was undoubtedly better than that offered by Veritas Elite! Although the majority of the information i had studied did not show up on the test, i felt prepared to deal with any problem that could have been thrown at me.  Veritas only prepared me for the most common problems which could be asked.  I also want to let you know that the incredible detail you pack into each GMAT study and training file allowed me to prepare for each GMAT section in the required depth.  Veritas Prep just put out some stuff out there and forced you to memorize concepts, hoping its crash course would provide enough of the tools necessary to solve most of the problems.   Veritas prep materials also lacked the depth and quality of training that MLIC offered. I strongly recommend MLIC GMAT prep course to anyone serious about getting a score in the 90th percentile range. Thanks again.

Our Turboprep GMAT course participant writes: ""A lawyer admitted to the bar in Munich Germany, I attempted to take the GMAT, knowing that my challenge was in the GMAT Math area. I took a GMAT prep course conducted by a German testpreparation company in Frankfurt and found that the level of teaching involved very simple GMAT problems, even worse than those taught in Kaplan GMAT prep or Princeton Review GMAT classes. After scoring 570 on the GMAT in my first attempt, I researched on the Internet GMAT prep courses and enrolled in the GMAT prep class offered by an American testpreparation Company, MLIC, New York. MLIC GMAT preparation course, besides offering excellent GMAT study and GMAT training materials, also reinforces the learning process with original GMAT questions. The individual attention received from dedicated instructor in the MLIC GMAT class helps one overcome his or her weakness in Mathematics and in Verbal areas of GMAT. Result: I scored 670 on the GMAT. Anyone whose GMAT Mathematics and Verbal skills are rusty should take the GMAT prep course such as the one offered by MLICETS.""--  Handelsblatt, DE, Germany's leading Business Daily  (Freitag/Samstag/Sonntag, 18/19/20.2.2005).""          WHAT IS GMAT® CAT?                  GMAT® , acronym for  G raduate  M anagement  A dmission  T est, is administered by Pearson Vue® on behalf of GMAC® and is required by all  G raduate  S chools of  B usiness for admission purposes.               The GMAT, according to  GMAC                (Graduate Management Admission Council that owns the trademarks GMAT®  and GMAT CAT®, is one measure of your ability to successfully              complete the first year of graduate study program (MBA degree program) at a Graduate School of Business.However, effective January 2006, the paper and pencil version of the GMAT test is no longer offered anywhere in the world. GMATis              administered in a CAT(Computer Adaptive) format in which the GMAT test'adapts' the              difficulty level of GMAT questions to your GMAT-specific 'comfort level', with 'higher              difficulty level GMAT questions' carrying higher GMAT raw scores (GMAT Scaled              Scores) than do 'lower difficulty level' GMAT questions. The              GMAT tests your Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning skills, and your ability (i) to process information in context, (ii) to make necessarily true and probable interpretations of information presented, and (iii) to test different scenarios for consistency of decisions. The test also is about your ability to determine whether GMAT sentences are logically, clearly, correctly, and effectively written.  The GMAT  has three              assessment areas:    AWA  (Analytical Writing Assessment)              that requires you to write Two essays, one analyzing an Issue              and the other analyzing an Argument. This first essay section on the GMAT is not 'adaptive'              and receives a separate score of between 0 and 6.   GMAT Quantitative Assessment  is the first              of the two 'adaptive' sections on the GMAT and follows the Analytical Writing section, and requires that you              answer 37 questions in problem solving and in Data Sufficiency in 75 minutes. Following the GMAT Quantitative section, you will be required to work on the last 'adaptive' section on              the GMAT is  Verbal              Assessment , which requires that you answer 41              questions in 75 minutes. The GMAT Verbal assessment includes three sections: GMAT Critical Reasoning, GMAT Sentence Correction, and GMAT Reading Comprehension. GMAT adaptive sections also include              experimental questions, at least 9 in GMAT Quantitative assessment and 11              in GMAT Verbal assessment. The two adaptive sections on the GMAT receive a combined             score of between 200 and 800. Most A-List Business Schools rated in the top-10 will              require a GMAT test score of at least 650 in order for you to be              competitive. Your best chance for success lies in your ability to              take the GMAT exam at the high difficulty level throughout. The MLICETS GMAT prep              courses offer the best GMAT test training, using the  most recent and high difficulty level questions that are live on the GMAT  so that              you can competently and confidently take the GMAT test in a timed-environment.

TESTIMONIALS ABOUT MLIC GMAT COURSES  ""I had taken Kaplan course for the GMATs and enrolled in MLIC's preparatory course in London after scoring a miserable 480. Here is my experience with both programmes:  Kaplan course was run by an instructor who taught a few tricks and showed how they worked with a couple of problems from the book and moved on. MLIC course had a professional instructor who was highly knowledgeable and who put us through the paces in respect of procedures and concepts, and was able to help each one of us in our weak areas. MLIC training materials for the GMAT were more thorough and covered some of the areas actually tested on the GMAT: sequences, patterns, permutations and combinations, and parabolas that actually showed up on my test.  There are massive differences between the Kaplan course and that offered by MLIC, and my experience is that MLIC is vastly superior. My score improved from 480 to 670 after the MLIC class. I have no hesitation in recommending MLIC course for the GMAT.            --  David Hanfil , GMAT TURBOPREP® Course, London Paddington, April 2008--  GMAT Hall of Famer, 05/08 .""   ""I was a trainee in your Gmat turboprep course in London during January 2008, and received a score of 710 when I took the exam 10 days after the course. Having worked through other prep materials available from book stores, I was impressed with your study guides and training materials that covered the Gmat sections in great depth. Your training methods and strategies for verbal sections were brilliant. Last but not least, your Gmat trainer was witty and competent, and explained how different areas of the Gmat test the same skills.  Your prep methods work.

PRE-CLASS GMAT TRAINING   OBJECTIVE OF PRE-COURSE TRAINING  The objective of pre-course training lasting about 50 to 60 hours is to provide a highly structured approach to GMAT training, and to have the registered participants begin to review GMAT-critical concepts and procedures that are critical to taking the GMAT confidently and competently. The pre-course training is also structured to provide remedial training in areas such as algebra, statistics, and sentence correction grammar and idiom rules, and to create a diagnostic baseline for the in-class training. The pre-course training is also meant to help participants unlearn some of the bad habits that they may have picked up from reading useless GMAT prep materials that can be bought in book stores (materials such as those published by Barrons, Arco, GMAT for dummies, to name a few) or obtained from other me-too prep companies (such as Kaplan, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT, Veritas Prep, Testmasters, 800score.com and others) that have no proven competencies in GMAT training. The pre-course GMAT training is expected to require a commitment of about 50 to 60 hours before you attend the in-class training sessions and provides the required depth of understanding in all the GMAT concepts areas so that you can leverage the in-class training.

Review of Analytical Writing basics and completion of 5 writing tasks covering GMAT Analysis of an Issue and GMAT Analysis of an Argument.   Review of Sentence Correction Grammar and Idiom rules tested on the GMAT, and completion of a short assignment testing your understanding of the critical rules in Sentence Correction.   Review of Subject-Scope-Qualifier strategy for GMAT Critical Reasoning, and review of Illogical and Logical Arguments; Review of types of questions tested in critical reasoning and the procedures for answering them; Review of Hit List of phrases that will spell trouble in Critical Reasoning answer choices.   Review of Anchor-Phrase Strategy for GMAT Reading Comprehension, and procedures for making Logical interpretation of context-specific information relevant to the question.

The  SAT Reasoning Test  (formerly  Scholastic Aptitude Test  and  Scholastic Assessment Test ) is a  standardized test  for  college admissions  in the  United States . The SAT is owned, published, and developed by the  College Board , a  non-profit organization  in the United States, and was once developed, published, and scored by the  Educational Testing Service  (ETS). [ 1 ]  ETS now administers the exam.   The current SAT Reasoning Test is administered in about four and one half hours and costs $50 ($71 International), excluding late fees. [ 2 ]  Since the SAT's introduction in 1901, its name and scoring has changed several times. In 2005, the test was renamed as ""SAT Reasoning Test"" with possible scores from 600 to 2400 combining test results from three 800-point sections (math, critical reading, and writing), along with other subsections scored separately.

They state that the SAT assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problemsskills they learned in school that they will need in college. The SAT is typically taken by  high school   juniors  and  seniors . [ 3 ]  Specifically, the College Board states that use of the SAT in combination with high school grade point average (GPA) provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone, as measured by college freshman  GPA . Various studies conducted over the lifetime of the SAT show a statistically significant increase in  correlation  of high school grades and freshman grades when the SAT is factored in. [ 4 ]   There are substantial differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to American  federalism , local control, and the prevalence of private, distance, and  home schooled  students. SAT (and  ACT ) scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local datasuch as course work, grades, and class rankin a national perspective. [ 5 ]   Historically, the SAT has been more popular among colleges in the coasts and the ACT more popular in the Midwest and South. There are some colleges that require the ACT to be taken for college course placement, and a few schools that do not accept the SAT at all.  [ 6 ]   Certain high IQ societies, like  Mensa  and the  Triple Nine Society , use scores from certain years as one of their admission tests. For instance, the  Triple Nine Society  accepts scores of 1450 on tests taken before April 1995, and scores of at least 1520 on tests taken between April 1995 and February 2005.     [ edit ]   Structure   SAT consists of three major sections: Critical  Reading ,  Mathematics , and  Writing . Each section receives a score on the scale of 200800. All scores are multiples of 10. Total scores are calculated by adding up scores of the three sections. Each major section is divided into three parts. There are 10 sub-sections, including an additional 25-minute experimental or ""equating"" section that may be in any of the three major sections. The experimental section is used to  normalize  questions for future administrations of the SAT and does not count toward the final score. The test contains 3 hours and 45 minutes of actual timed sections, [ 7 ]  although most administrations, including orientation, distribution of materials, completion of biographical sections, and eleven minutes of timed breaks, run about four and a half hours long.     [ edit ]   Critical Reading   The Critical Reading, formerly verbal, section of the SAT is made up of three scored sections, two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, with varying types of questions, including sentence completions and questions about short and long reading passages. Critical Reading sections normally begin with 5 to 8 sentence completion questions; the remainder of the questions are focused on the reading passages. Sentence completions generally test the student's  vocabulary  and understanding of sentence structure and organization by requiring the student to select one or two words that best complete a given sentence. The bulk of the Critical Reading questions is made up of questions regarding reading passages, in which students read short excerpts on social sciences, humanities, physical sciences, or personal narratives and answer questions based on the passage. Certain sections contain passages asking the student to compare two related passages; generally, these consist of short reading passages as well as longer passages. Since this is a timed test, the number of questions about each passage is proportional to the length of the passage.     [ edit ]   Mathematics   The  Mathematics  section of SAT is widely known as Quantitative Section. Mathematics section consists of three scored sections. There are two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, as follows:     One of the 25-minute sections is entirely multiple choice, with 20 questions.   The other 25-minute section contains 8 multiple choice questions and 10 grid-in questions.   The 20-minute is all multiple choice, with only 16 questions.     Notably, the SAT has done away with quantitative comparison questions on the math section, leaving only questions with straightforward  symbolic  or  numerical  answers. Since the quantitative comparison questions were well-known for their deceptive natureoften turning on the student's recognition of a single exception to a rule or patternthis choice has been equated to a philosophical shift away from ""trickery"" and toward ""straight math"" on the SAT. Also, many test experts have attributed this change, like the addition of the new writing section, to an attempt to make the SAT more like the  ACT . Indeed, there is a correlation between ACT scores and SAT scores. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Writing          Page 1 of an SAT essay. This student received a 7/12 from two judges, one giving 3/6 and the other giving 4/6.              Page 2 of the same essay.       The writing section of the SAT, based on but not directly comparable to the old SAT II subject test in writing, includes multiple choice questions and a brief essay. The essay subscore contributes about 30% towards the total writing score, with the multiple choice questions contributing 70%. This section was implemented in March 2005 following complaints from colleges about the lack of uniform examples of a student's writing ability.   The multiple choice questions include error identification questions, sentence improvement questions, and paragraph improvement questions. Error identification and sentence improvement questions test the student's knowledge of grammar, presenting an awkward or grammatically incorrect sentence; in the error identification section, the student must locate the word producing the source of the error or indicate that the sentence has no error, while the sentence improvement section requires the student to select an acceptable fix to the awkward sentence. The paragraph improvement questions test the student's understanding of logical organization of ideas, presenting a poorly written student essay and asking a series of questions as to what changes might be made to best improve it.   The essay section, which is always administered as the first section of the test, is 25 minutes long. All essays must be in response to a given prompt. The prompts are broad and often philosophical and are designed to be accessible to students regardless of their educational and social backgrounds. For instance, test takers may be asked to expound on such ideas as their opinion on the value of work in human life or whether technological change also carries negative consequences to those who benefit from it. No particular essay structure is required, and the College Board accepts examples ""taken from [the student's] reading, studies, experience, or observations."" Two trained readers assign each essay a score between 1 and 6, where a score of 0 is reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic, non-English, not written with a Number 2 pencil, or considered illegible after several attempts at reading. The scores are summed to produce a final score from 2 to 12 (or 0). If the two readers' scores differ by more than one point, then a senior third reader decides. The average time each reader/grader spends on each essay is less than 3 minutes.  [ 10 ]   Despite the  College Board 's claims that the SAT Essay is a nonbiased assessment of a student's writing ability, many different claims of bias have surfaced, including claims that readers give higher points to those who write in cursive, writers who write about personal experiences are less likely to get higher scores, and that topics favor the higher social classes. [ citation needed ]  The College Board strictly denies any forms of bias on all portions of the SAT Reasoning Exam. In addition, essays with factual errors were not penalized for the errors.   In March 2004 Dr. Les Perelman analyzed 15 scored sample essays contained in the College Board's Score Write book and found that 90% of essays that contained more than 400 words got the highest score of 12 and that the essays with 100 words or fewer got the lowest grade of 1. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Questions   Most of the questions on the SAT are  multiple choice ; all multiple-choice questions have five answer choices, one of which is correct. The questions of each section of the same type are generally ordered by difficulty. However, an important exception exists: Questions that follow the long and short reading passages are organized chronologically, rather than by difficulty. Ten of the questions in one of the math sub-sections are not multiple choice. They instead require the test taker to bubble in a number in a four-column grid.   The questions are weighted equally. For each correct answer, one raw point is added. For each incorrect answer one-fourth of a point is deducted. [ 11 ]  No points are deducted for incorrect math grid-in questions. This ensures that a student's  mathematically expected gain  from guessing is zero. The final score is derived from the raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations.   The SAT therefore recommends only making educated guesses, that is, when the test taker can eliminate at least one answer he or she thinks is wrong. Without eliminating any answers one's probability of answering correctly is 20%. Eliminating one wrong answer increases this probability to 25%; two, a 33.3% probability; three, a 50% probability of choosing the correct answer and thus earning the full point for the question.

The test is typically offered on the first Saturday of the month for the November, December, May, and June administrations. In other countries, the SAT is offered on the same dates as in the  United States  except for the first spring test date (i.e., March or April), which is not offered. In 2006, the test was taken 1,465,744 times. [ 12 ]   Candidates may either take the SAT Reasoning Test or up to three  SAT Subject Tests  on any given test date, except the first spring test date, when only the SAT Reasoning Test is offered. Candidates wishing to take the test may register online at the College Board's website, by mail, or by telephone, at least three weeks before the test date.   The SAT Subject Tests are all given in one large book on test day. Therefore, it is actually immaterial which tests, and how many, the student signs up for; with the possible exception of the language tests with listening, the student may change his or her mind and take  any  tests, regardless of his or her initial sign-ups. Students who choose to take more subject tests than they signed up for will later be billed by College Board for the additional tests and their scores will be withheld until the bill is paid. Students who choose to take fewer subject tests than they signed up for are not eligible for a refund.   The SAT Reasoning Test costs $45 ($71 International). For the Subject tests, students pay a $20 Basic Registration Fee and $9 per test (except for language tests with listening, which cost $20 each). [ 2 ]  The College Board makes fee waivers available for low income students. Additional fees apply for late registration, standby testing, registration changes, scores by telephone, and extra score reports (beyond the four provided for free).   Candidates whose religious beliefs prevent them from taking the test on a Saturday may request to take the test on the following Sunday, except for the October test date in which the Sunday test date is eight days after the main test offering. Such requests must be made at the time of registration and are subject to denial.   Students with verifiable disabilities, including physical and learning disabilities, are eligible to take the SAT with accommodations. The standard time increase for students requiring additional time due to learning disabilities is 50%.     [ edit ]   Raw scores, scaled scores, and percentiles   Students receive their online score reports approximately three weeks after test administration (six weeks for mailed, paper scores), with each section graded on a scale of 200800 and two sub scores for the writing section: the essay score and the multiple choice sub score. In addition to their score, students receive their  percentile  (the percentage of other test takers with lower scores). The raw score, or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers (ranges from just under 50 to just under 60, depending upon the test), is also included. [ 13 ]  Students may also receive, for an additional fee, the Question and Answer Service, which provides the student's answer, the correct answer to each question, and online resources explaining each question.   The corresponding percentile of each scaled score varies from test to testfor example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both sections of the SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are because of the content of the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often in the form of an  AP , which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.   The percentiles that various SAT scores for college-bound seniors correspond to are summarized in the following chart: [ 14 ] [ 12 ]       Percentile   Score, 1600 Scale  (official, 2006)   Score, 2400 Scale  (official, 2006)       99.93/99.98*   1600   2400       99+   1550   2300       99   1480   2200       98   1450   2140       97   1420   2100       88   1380   1900       83   1280   1800       78   1200   1770       72   1150   1700       61   1090   1600       48   1010   1500       36   950   1400       15   810   1200       4   670   1010       1   520   790       * The percentile of the perfect score was 99.98 on the 2400 scale and 99.93 on the 1600 scale.       The older SAT (before 1995) had a very high ceiling. In any given year, only seven of the million test-takers scored above 1580. A score above 1580 was equivalent to the 99.9995 percentile.

Although there is no official conversion chart between the SAT and its biggest rival, the  ACT , the College Board released an unofficial chart based on results from 103,525 test takers who took both tests between October 1994 and December 1996  here ; however, both tests have changed since then. Several colleges have also issued their own charts. The following is based on the University of California's conversion chart.

[ edit ]   1901 test   The College Board began on June 17, 1901, when 973 students took its first test, across 67 locations in the United States, and two in Europe. Although those taking the test came from a variety of backgrounds, approximately one third were from  New York ,  New Jersey , or  Pennsylvania . The majority of those taking the test were from private schools, academies, or endowed schools. About 60% of those taking the test applied to  Columbia University . The test contained sections on English,  French ,  German ,  Latin ,  Greek , history, mathematics,  chemistry , and  physics . The test was not multiple choice, but instead was evaluated based on essay responses as ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""doubtful,"" ""poor,"" or ""very poor.""  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   1926 test   The first administration of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it was known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of  definitions ,  arithmetic , classification, artificial language,  antonyms , number series,  analogies ,  logical inference , and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to  Yale University  and  Smith College  respectively.  [ 20 ]  The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1928 and 1929 tests   In 1928 the number of verbal sections was reduced to 7, and the time limit was increased to slightly under two hours. In 1929 the number of sections was again reduced, this time to 6. These changes in part loosened time constraints on test-takers. Math was eliminated entirely for these tests, instead focusing only on verbal ability. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1930 test and 1936 changes   In 1930 the SAT was first split into the verbal and math sections, a structure that would continue through 2004. The verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range on content than its predecessors, examining only antonyms, double definitions (somewhat similar to sentence completions), and paragraph reading. In 1936, analogies were re-added. Between 1936 and 1946, students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions (over a third of which were on antonyms). The mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 free response questions to be answered in 80 minutes, and focused primarily on speed. From 1936 to 1941, like the 1928 and 1929 tests, the mathematics section was eliminated entirely. When the mathematics portion of the test was re-added in 1942, it consisted of multiple choice questions. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1946 test and associated changes   Paragraph reading was eliminated from the verbal portion of the SAT in 1946, and replaced with reading comprehension, and ""double definition"" questions were replaced with sentence completions. Between 1946 and 1957 students were given 90 to 100 minutes to complete 107 to 170 verbal questions. Starting in 1958 time limits became more stable, and for 17 years, until 1975, students had 75 minutes to answer 90 questions. In 1959 questions on data sufficiency were introduced to the mathematics section, and then replaced with quantitative comparisons in 1974. In 1974 both verbal and math sections were reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes each, with changes in test composition compensating for the decreased time. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   1980 test and associated changes   The inclusion of the ""Strivers"" Score study was implemented. This study was introduced by The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT, and has been conducting research on how to make it easier for minorities and individuals who suffer from social and economic barriers. The original ""Strivers"" project, which was in the research phase from 19801994, awarded special ""Striver"" status to test-takers who scored 200 points higher than expected for their race, gender and income level. The belief was that this would give minorities a better chance at being accepted in to a college of higher standard, i.e. an Ivy League school. In 1992, the Strivers Project was leaked to the public; as a result the Strivers Project was terminated in 1993. After Federal Courts heard arguments from the ACLU, NAACP and the Educational Testing Service, the courts ordered the study to alter its data collection process, stating that only the age, race and zip code could be used to determine the test-takers eligibility for ""Strivers"" points. These changes were introduced to the SAT effective in 1994.     [ edit ]   1994 changes   In 1994 the verbal section received a dramatic change in focus. Among these changes were the removal of  antonym  questions, and an increased focus on passage reading. The mathematics section also saw a dramatic change in 1994, thanks in part to pressure from the  National Council of Teachers of Mathematics . For the first time since 1935, the SAT asked some non-multiple choice questions, instead requiring students to supply the answers. 1994 also saw the introduction of calculators into the mathematics section for the first time in the test's history. The mathematics section introduced concepts of probability, slope, elementary statistics, counting problems, median and mode. [ 19 ]   The average score on the 1994 modification of the SAT I was usually around 1000 (500 on the verbal, 500 on the math). The most selective schools in the United States (for example, those in the  Ivy League ) typically had SAT averages exceeding 1400 on the old test.     [ edit ]   2002 changes - Score Choice   In October 2002, the College Board dropped the Score Choice Option. Under this option, scores were not released to colleges until the student saw and approved of the score. [ 21 ]  The reasoning was that the option benefited wealthier students who could afford to take it multiple times. The College Board has since decided to re-implement Score Choice in the spring of 2009. It is described as optional, and it is not clear if the reports sent will indicate whether or not this student has opted-in or not. A number of highly selective colleges and universities have accounced they will require applicants to submit all scores, including Harvard, Cornell, Yale and Stanford. Others, such as MIT, have embraced Score Choice.     [ edit ]   2005 changes   In 2005, the test was changed again, largely in response to criticism by the  University of California system . [ 22 ]  Because of issues concerning ambiguous questions, especially  analogies , certain types of questions were eliminated (the analogies from the verbal and quantitative comparisons from the Math section). The test was made marginally harder, as a corrective to the rising number of perfect scores. A new writing section, with an essay, based on the former SAT II Writing Subject Test, was added, in part to increase the chances of closing the opening gap between the highest and midrange scores. Other factors included the desire to test the writing ability of each student in a personal manner; hence the essay. The New SAT (known as the SAT Reasoning Test) was first offered on March 12, 2005, after the last administration of the ""old"" SAT in January of 2005. The Mathematics section was expanded to cover three years of high school mathematics. The Verbal section's name was changed to the Critical Reading section.     [ edit ]   2008 changes   In 2008, or rather for the late 2008, 2009 testing, a new variable came into play. Before, it was required for applicants to most colleges to submit all scores with some colleges who embraced Score Choice to allow their students to do so. However, this year, applicants now have the choice to submit their best score (in theory one could send any score they wish to send) to the college of their choice, no matter the college. Designed to reduce stress to applicants as well as make the overall process easier, students in many schools have embraced this change with a sigh of relief.     [ edit ]   Name changes and recentered scores   Although originally standing for ""Scholastic Aptitude Test"" [ 23 ] , in 1990, because of uncertainty about the SAT's ability to function as an  intelligence test , the name was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test. In 1993 the name was changed to SAT I: Reasoning Test (with the  letters not standing for anything ) to distinguish it from the  SAT II: Subject Tests [ 23 ] . In 2004, the roman numerals on both tests were dropped, and the SAT I renamed the SAT Reasoning Test [ 23 ] . The scoring categories are now the following: Critical Reading (comparable to some of the Verbal portions of the old SAT I), Mathematics, and Writing. The writing section now includes an essay, whose score is involved in computing the overall score for the Writing section, as well as grammar sections (also comparable to some Verbal portions of the previous SAT).   The test scoring was initially scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section with a  standard deviation  of 100. [ 24 ]  As the test grew more popular and more students from less rigorous schools began taking the test, the average dropped to about 428 Verbal and 478 Math. The SAT was ""recentered"" in 1995, and the average ""new"" score became again close to 500. Scores awarded after 1994 and before October 2001 are officially reported with an ""R"" (e.g. 1260R) to reflect this change. Old scores may be recentered to compare to 1995 to present scores by using official College Board tables [ 25 ]  , which in the middle ranges add about 70 points to Verbal and 20 or 30 points to Math. In other words, current students have a 100 (70 plus 30) point advantage over their parents.     [ edit ]   Controversy     [ edit ]   Scoring problems of October 2005 tests   In March 2006, it was announced that a small percentage of the SATs taken in October 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers being moist and not scanning properly, and that some students had received substantially erroneous scores. The College Board announced they would change the scores for the students who were given a lower score than they earned, but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores. The College Board decided not to change the scores for the students who were given a higher score than they earned. A lawsuit was filed in 2005 by about 4,400 students who received an incorrect low score on the SAT. The class-action suit was settled in August 2007 when The College Board and another company that administers the college-admissions test announced they would pay $2.85 million to over 4,000 students. Under the agreement each student can either elect to receive $275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she feels the damage was even greater. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism     [ edit ]   Bias                        As depicted above, SAT scores vary according to race, income, and parental educational background.       A famous example of alleged bias in the SAT I was the  oarsman - regatta  analogy question. [ 27 ]  The object of the question was to find the pair of terms that have the relationship most similar to the relationship between ""runner"" and ""marathon."" The correct answer was ""oarsman"" and ""regatta."" Choice of the correct answer presupposed students' familiarity with a sport popular with the wealthy, and so upon their knowledge of its structure and terminology. Fifty-three percent (53%) of white students - who in greater numbers come from higher income households - correctly answered the question, while only 22% of black students - who disproportionately came from lower income households - also scored correctly. [ 28 ]  Analogy questions have since been replaced by short reading passages.     [ edit ]   Dropping SAT   A growing number of  liberal arts colleges  have responded to this criticism by joining the  SAT optional movement . These colleges do not require the SAT for admission.   In a 2001 speech to the  American Council on Education ,  Richard C. Atkinson , then president of the  University of California , urged dropping the SAT Reasoning Test as a college admissions requirement:     ""Anyone involved in education should be concerned about how overemphasis on the SAT is distorting educational priorities and practices, how the test is perceived by many as unfair, and how it can have a devastating impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young students. There is widespread agreement that overemphasis on the SAT harms American education."" [ 29 ]     In response to threats by the University of California to drop the SAT as an admission requirement, the College Entrance Examination Board announced the restructuring of the SAT, to take effect in March 2005, as detailed above.     [ edit ]   Essay   In 2005,  MIT  Writing Director  Les Perelman  plotted essay length versus essay score on the new SAT from released essays and found a high correlation between them. After studying 23 graded essays he found that the longer the essay was the higher the score. He also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors. However, the official SAT guide for scorers state that the essays should be scored according to their quality of writing and not factual accuracy. The National Council of Teachers of English also criticize the 25-minute writing section of the test, arguing that the basic principles of writing encourage the revision of written material several times. They say that the amount of time allowed for the test pushes schools to develop a formulaic system of writing. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Test preparation   Many companies and organizations offer test preparation in the form of books, classes, online courses, tutoring and only recently, board games. Large organizations include  Kaplan ,  the Princeton Review , PowerScore, Barron's, Elite Educational Institute, Revolution Prep, Ivy Insiders, Testmasters, SAT Solutions, and College Board (the test makers), as well as some boutique organizations such as Los Angeles-based College Prep Review. Some have criticized the SAT test because preparation often can lead to much higher scores, but some have embraced the opportunity to improve their scores.
